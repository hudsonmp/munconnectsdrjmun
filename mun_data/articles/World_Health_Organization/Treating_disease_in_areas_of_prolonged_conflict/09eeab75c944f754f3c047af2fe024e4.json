Whenever possible, we encouraged communities to start livelihood initiatives.\nWe also supported health structures serving communities with essential medicines and medical equipment. Through our physical rehabilitation programme, people with disabilities were able to receive orthopedic footwear and mobility devices. We provided support to those released from their detention, allowing them to return home with dignity. We also assisted in identifying the whereabouts of people's missing loved ones through our Family Links programme, and whenever possible, we worked to reunite families or maintain contact between family members. We were able to do this by exchanging messages and/or supporting family visits.
