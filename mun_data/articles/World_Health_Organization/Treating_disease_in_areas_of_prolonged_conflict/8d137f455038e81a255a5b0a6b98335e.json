Since then we have become a leader in the field, thanks to our depth of expertise, the technology we have developed to produce high-quality assistive and mobility devices at low cost, and our lasting commitment to the centres we support. Our process aims to restore and enhance not only the person’s ability to physically perform daily tasks, but their sense of independence as well.\n\nOur rehabilitation programme was founded in 1979.
