People are forced to walk for hours through destroyed streets to find drinking water – that which may not be completely safe.\nEven locating your neighborhood can be difficult. Landmarks are gone, and any sense of direction is easily lost. \nPeople had heard about the destruction but seeing it with their own eyes is striking – and devastating. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmed Al Waheidi/ICRC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs more and more people have left to the north, areas in the south have become less crowded, but the situation remains dire. Lack of infrastructure and solid waste buildup, combined with the influx of people for so many months has created the risk of flooding after only minutes of rain. \nWinter also means a drop in temperature and heavy winds across Gaza. Many of those who have been displaced to tents in the south have been living under the same sheets or pieces of plastic for months and are seeing a drastic deterioration in their makeshift shelters. These cannot provide even basic protection after so long, and in such strong weather.

People seek out shelter among the collapsing buildings where the risk of unexploded ordnance, although an ever-present threat, is deprioritized for more immediate needs like shelter from the elements, food and water.\n\nReturning home anywhere in Gaza is not easy, even though many have been joyful to leave behind the situations they were forced into for over a year. Some, who had not imagined the devastation they would find in the north, decided to retrace their steps and return again to the south. On the journey, many collapsed from exhaustion and tragically, some did not survive. \nThose who do make it home tell us that the emotions they experience are overwhelming. A mix of hope, shock and devastation. They’ve lived through 15 months of conflict, endured the heartbreak of being uprooted time and time again, forced to leave behind their homes, communities, and a sense of belonging. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmed Al Waheidi/ICRC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving faced immense struggles just to meet their most basic needs for more than a year, they now return to homes without rooves, without their things, and with limited access to food, water, and health care. The cold at this time of year makes life even harder.
