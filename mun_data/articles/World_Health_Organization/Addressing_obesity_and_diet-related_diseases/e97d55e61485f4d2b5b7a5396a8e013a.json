Individuals with obesity face a higher risk for adverse outcomes of COVID-19, and home quarantining measures have also exacerbated factors that predispose to obesity. In this module, Dr Donna Ryan discusses the links between obesity and COVID-19 and the underlying biologic mechanisms of this association, and outlines management strategies to provide effective treatment to patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Obesity and Ethnicity\n                    \n\n\nObesity and Ethnicity\nDr Shahrad Taheri\nHealth professionals need an understanding of the variations in obesity amongst different ethnic groups and the possible reasons for this in order to provide the best care. This module explores how obesity measures should be interpreted in the context of ethnicity, the latest trends in obesity figures amongst minority ethnic groups, variations in perception of weight between cultures and variations in genetic predisposition to obesity. Finally, this module identifies the gaps in our knowledge regarding the diets, nutrition and health status of migrant groups where little research is available.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Obesity and Mental Health (Part 1)\n                    \n\n\nObesity and Mental Health (Part 1)\nDr Samantha Scholtz\nThis course focuses on the interaction of obesity and mental health, focusing on the high prevalence of common mental disorders in people living with obesity and the high levels of obesity in patients who live with serious mental illness. People with serious mental illness die 15-20 years younger than their counterparts due to metabolic illnesses, often as a consequence of obesity. We present neural and psychological responses to food, the gut-brain axis, microbiome and epigenetic factors involved in the development of overweight and overeating. The role of anti-psychotic medication in causing weight gain and mitigating steps that clinicians might take to prevent or help weight gain is explored as is the role of psychological support to those with obesity.  \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Obesity and Mental Health (Part 2)\n                    \n\n\nObesity and Mental Health (Part 2)\nDr Samantha Scholtz and Dr Denise Ratcliffe\nThis course focuses understanding the psychologist’s or psychiatrist’s role in a multi-disciplinary approach to management of obesity, in the understanding that obesity is an illness which affects and is affected by mental health. The evidence from a move away from a gatekeeper role is considered, and the psychological factors which might increase either physical or psychological risk from bariatric surgery is explored, clarifying how these might be reduced or mitigated by intelligent psychological involvement, integrated working across services and appropriate liaison and onward referral to specialist mental health services where indicated. Eating disorders, alcohol use disorder and suicide and self harm post operatively are explored in more detail. The evidence base for psychological interventions to support good outcomes after bariatric surgery is presented. \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Obesity and PCOS\n                    \n\n\nObesity and PCOS\nDr Thomas Barber\nThis module discusses the diagnostic criteria of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and the association of this condition with obesity. You will learn the central role of insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia in PCOS with the implications for clinical management. The role of visceral fat as a contributor to insulin resistance in PCOS is covered along with the role of metformin in treatment. The question of whether the presence of PCOS may make it harder for women to lose weight will be tackled.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Obesity and Prediabetes\n                    \n\n\nObesity and Prediabetes\nProf Nick Finer\nThis module introduces the relationship between obesity and prediabetes, including a discussion of fat distribution, inflammation and insulin resistance.

This module provides guidance for understanding and changing both physical activity and sedentary behaviour in individuals who have obesity by using the behavioural epidemiology framework that targets measurement, health outcomes, correlates and interventions.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Telemedicine in Obesity Care\n                    \n\n\nTelemedicine in Obesity Care\nDr Agbo Urudinachi\nThe use of telemedicine - broadly defined as the delivery of health care services at a distance using electronic means - has increased significantly in prevalence due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated distancing measures. This module, authored by Dr Agbo Urudinachi, provides an introduction to telemedicine with specific reference to its use in obesity care and practice. The author discusses the main benefits and challenges telemedicine presents to patients, practitioners and health systems.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        The Treatment of Diabetes in Obesity\n                    \n\n\nThe Treatment of Diabetes in Obesity\nProf Alexander Kokkinos\nThis course highlights the causal association between obesity and diabetes and proceeds to explore the methods of treating the latter while also addressing the former condition. Lifestyle measures are presented in detail, stressing the need for the employment of hypocaloric diets and increased physical activity. The pharmaceutical classes for the treatment of type 2 diabetes are then described, with an emphasis on those that lead to weight loss or are weight neutral. The cardioprotective and renoprotective properties of some of these drugs are also stressed. Medications approved for the treatment of obesity are then discussed, with a focus on their glycemic effect. The course concludes with a presentation of the role of metabolic surgery in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with obesity, and a discussion of the recent guidelines proposed by the 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Understanding Patient Perspectives on Obesity\n                    \n\n\nUnderstanding Patient Perspectives on Obesity\nDr Rachel Pryke\nThis module provides personal viewpoints from both patients and healthcare professionals describing their feelings around fighting obesity and around professional support.

This module provides guidance for understanding and changing both physical activity and sedentary behaviour in individuals who have obesity by using the behavioural epidemiology framework that targets measurement, health outcomes, correlates and interventions.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Telemedicine in Obesity Care\n                    \n\n\nTelemedicine in Obesity Care\nDr Agbo Urudinachi\nThe use of telemedicine - broadly defined as the delivery of health care services at a distance using electronic means - has increased significantly in prevalence due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated distancing measures. This module, authored by Dr Agbo Urudinachi, provides an introduction to telemedicine with specific reference to its use in obesity care and practice. The author discusses the main benefits and challenges telemedicine presents to patients, practitioners and health systems.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        The Treatment of Diabetes in Obesity\n                    \n\n\nThe Treatment of Diabetes in Obesity\nProf Alexander Kokkinos\nThis course highlights the causal association between obesity and diabetes and proceeds to explore the methods of treating the latter while also addressing the former condition. Lifestyle measures are presented in detail, stressing the need for the employment of hypocaloric diets and increased physical activity. The pharmaceutical classes for the treatment of type 2 diabetes are then described, with an emphasis on those that lead to weight loss or are weight neutral. The cardioprotective and renoprotective properties of some of these drugs are also stressed. Medications approved for the treatment of obesity are then discussed, with a focus on their glycemic effect. The course concludes with a presentation of the role of metabolic surgery in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with obesity, and a discussion of the recent guidelines proposed by the 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Understanding Patient Perspectives on Obesity\n                    \n\n\nUnderstanding Patient Perspectives on Obesity\nDr Rachel Pryke\nThis module provides personal viewpoints from both patients and healthcare professionals describing their feelings around fighting obesity and around professional support. It considers the challenges in fighting obesity and the reasons why maintaining weight loss can be difficult for many patients.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Weight Bias: A Hidden Harm - Part 1\n                    \n\n\nWeight Bias: A Hidden Harm - Part 1\nDr Rebecca Puhl\nThis module provides an overview of the nature and extent of weight bias experienced by youth and adults, with specific attention to consequences of weight bias for health. Dr Puhl provides a summary of evidence highlighting links between weight bias and psychological wellbeing, eating behaviours and other physical health outcomes.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Weight Bias: A Hidden Harm - Part 2\n                    \n\n\nWeight Bias: A Hidden Harm - Part 2\nDr Rebecca Puhl\nThis module provides a summary of the ways in which weight bias can affect healthcare delivery and compromise care for patients with obesity. Dr Puhl outlines five strategies to reduce weight bias and improve supportive care in clinical practice for patients with obesity. She also highlights the importance of addressing weight bias in broader health communication beyond the medical office setting.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        When is Surgical Treatment for Obesity Appropriate?\n                    \n\n\nWhen is Surgical Treatment for Obesity Appropriate?\nDr Arya Sharma\nIn this module, Dr Arya Sharma outlines the key considerations when deciding whether surgery is appropriate for a patient with obesity. The module explores why repeated failed weight loss attempts may ultimately lead to worsening obesity, and why bariatric surgery does not remove the need for patients to engage in lifestyle change.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Working with Individuals to Change Eating Habits\n                    \n\n\nWorking with Individuals to Change Eating Habits\nDr Clare Grace\nThis module focuses on how health professionals can best guide their patients to develop a deeper understanding of their eating habits, to make and sustain evidence based dietary changes relevant to health improvement and weight management, and for patients to experience this process in a non-judgemental and supportive way.\n\nThe 5As of Obesity Management\n                    \n\n\nThe 5As of Obesity Management\nDr Arya Sharma\nThe 5As of obesity management are a set of practical tools to guide primary care practitioners in obesity counseling and management.

We present neural and psychological responses to food, the gut-brain axis, microbiome and epigenetic factors involved in the development of overweight and overeating. The role of anti-psychotic medication in causing weight gain and mitigating steps that clinicians might take to prevent or help weight gain is explored as is the role of psychological support to those with obesity.\n\nObesity and Mental Health (Part 1)\n                    \n\n\nObesity and Mental Health (Part 1)\nDr Samantha Scholtz\nThis course focuses on the interaction of obesity and mental health, focusing on the high prevalence of common mental disorders in people living with obesity and the high levels of obesity in patients who live with serious mental illness. People with serious mental illness die 15-20 years younger than their counterparts due to metabolic illnesses, often as a consequence of obesity.

Lifestyle measures are presented in detail, stressing the need for the employment of hypocaloric diets and increased physical activity. The pharmaceutical classes for the treatment of type 2 diabetes are then described, with an emphasis on those that lead to weight loss or are weight neutral. The cardioprotective and renoprotective properties of some of these drugs are also stressed. Medications approved for the treatment of obesity are then discussed, with a focus on their glycemic effect. The course concludes with a presentation of the role of metabolic surgery in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with obesity, and a discussion of the recent guidelines proposed by the 2nd Diabetes Surgery Summit.\n\nThe Treatment of Diabetes in Obesity\n                    \n\n\nThe Treatment of Diabetes in Obesity\nProf Alexander Kokkinos\nThis course highlights the causal association between obesity and diabetes and proceeds to explore the methods of treating the latter while also addressing the former condition.
