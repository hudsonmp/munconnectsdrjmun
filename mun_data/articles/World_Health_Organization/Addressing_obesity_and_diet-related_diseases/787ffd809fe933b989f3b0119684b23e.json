These weights were adjusted for differences in the age-sex composition of the sample population as compared to the target population.\nDifferent weight variables are available per Step:\nwStep1 - for interview data\nwStep2 - for physical measures\nwStep3 - for biochemical measures\nThis allows for differences in the weight calculation for each Step of the survey as the age-sex composition of the respondents to each Step can differ slightly due to refusal or drop out. Additionally, some countries perform subsampling for Step 2 and/or Step 3.  When no subsampling is done and response rates do not differ across Steps of the survey, the 3 weight variables will be the same.\n\n\nData collection\nDates of Data Collection\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n            \r\n                                                2018-02                                    \n            \r\n                                                2018-10                                    \n\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Notes\n\nCardiochek PA devices were used for blood glucose and cholesterol measurements.\n\n\nData Access\nAccess authority\n\n\n\nName\nAffiliation\nURL\nEmail\n\n\n            \r\n                                                NCD Surveillance Team                                    \n            \r\n                                                World Health Organization                                    \n            \r\n                                                http://www.who.int/ncds/surveillance/steps/en/                                    \n            \r\n                                                ncdmonitoring@who.int                                    \n\n\n\n\n\nAccess conditions\n\nThe user undertakes:\n(1) to acknowledge the data source.\n(2) to share any planned publications with WHO prior to publication.\n(3) to offer co-authorship of any reports or publications using the survey results  to the coordinator of the survey.\n(4) to use the data for non-commercial, not-for-profit public health purposes only.\n\n\n\nCitation requirements\n\nPublications based on STEPS data should cite the survey report (if available) and acknowledge the data source in the following manner:\n\"This paper uses data from the [country] [year] STEPS survey, implemented by [implementing agency] with the support of the World Health Organization.\"\n\n\nDisclaimer and copyrights\nDisclaimer\n\nThe data is being distributed without warranty of any kind.

These weights were adjusted for differences in the age-sex composition of the sample population as compared to the target population.\nDifferent weight variables are available per Step:\nwStep1 - for interview data\nwStep2 - for physical measures\nwStep3 - for biochemical measures\nThis allows for differences in the weight calculation for each Step of the survey as the age-sex composition of the respondents to each Step can differ slightly due to refusal or drop out. Additionally, some countries perform subsampling for Step 2 and/or Step 3.  When no subsampling is done and response rates do not differ across Steps of the survey, the 3 weight variables will be the same.\n\n\nData collection\nDates of Data Collection\n\n\n\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n            \r\n                                                2018-02                                    \n            \r\n                                                2018-10                                    \n\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Notes\n\nCardiochek PA devices were used for blood glucose and cholesterol measurements.\n\n\nData Access\nAccess authority\n\n\n\nName\nAffiliation\nURL\nEmail\n\n\n            \r\n                                                NCD Surveillance Team                                    \n            \r\n                                                World Health Organization                                    \n            \r\n                                                http://www.who.int/ncds/surveillance/steps/en/                                    \n            \r\n                                                ncdmonitoring@who.int                                    \n\n\n\n\n\nAccess conditions\n\nThe user undertakes:\n(1) to acknowledge the data source.\n(2) to share any planned publications with WHO prior to publication.\n(3) to offer co-authorship of any reports or publications using the survey results  to the coordinator of the survey.\n(4) to use the data for non-commercial, not-for-profit public health purposes only.\n\n\n\nCitation requirements\n\nPublications based on STEPS data should cite the survey report (if available) and acknowledge the data source in the following manner:\n\"This paper uses data from the [country] [year] STEPS survey, implemented by [implementing agency] with the support of the World Health Organization.\"\n\n\nDisclaimer and copyrights\nDisclaimer\n\nThe data is being distributed without warranty of any kind.
