It covers all the essentials of obesity management, including the causes of obesity, complications, how to raise the issue of obesity with patients, how to take a history and conduct an examination, how to achieve weight loss and how to address obesity in children and adolescents. GO TO SCOPE E-LEARNING\n\nSCOPE Certification\nCompletion of the Core Learning Path is a requirement of SCOPE Certification.

Proietto discusses the causes of obesity and the factors that can influence body weight, citing powerful evidence of obesity’s genetic basis and the relative importance of other causes. Starting the Patient Dialogue\nIn this video module, Dr Sharma demonstrates how to lead patients with obesity to healthy outcomes and how to raise the issue of obesity sensitively, using a clinical scenario to show correct and incorrect approaches.
