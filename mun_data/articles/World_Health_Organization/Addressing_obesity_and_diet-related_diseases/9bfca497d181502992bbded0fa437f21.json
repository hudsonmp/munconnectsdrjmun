Application to the primary care setting will also be discussed, as well as other key topics including eating disorders in the context of obesity treatment.\nACTIVITY PURPOSE/STATEMENT OF NEEDYouth with severe obesity are often unable to lose a clinically-meaningful amount of weight with lifestyle modification alone. Pharmacological therapies are emerging as a recognized adjunctive strategy to address this otherwise recalcitrant disease, yet no guidelines currently exist for the responsible clinical use of obesity pharmacotherapy in the pediatric patient.\nINTENDED AUDIENCEHealth care providers, researchers, and others interested in the clinical management of pediatric obesity.\nFORMATCase studies, lectures, and group discussion. This course is planned and hosted by the University of Minnesota Department of Pediatrics. For more information please contact the Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine, cpom@umn.edu or 612-626-2349.\nEDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVESFollowing completion of this activity, learners should be better able to:\n\nUnderstand the pathophysiology of obesity and the weight reduced state and apply this knowledge to treatment strategies for pediatric obesity.\nRecognize how weight related comorbidities contribute to worsening obesity and how to intervene\nLearn comprehensive strategies for the management of pediatric obesity using nutrition, physical activity, behavior, medications, and surgery.\n\nAccreditation StatementIn support of improving patient care, University of Minnesota, Interprofessional Continuing Education is jointly accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) to provide continuing education for the healthcare team.\nApplicants for certification through the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM) may claim up to 10 Category Two CME credits toward the ABOM requirement when providing a CME certificate or transcript from this course.
