The organizations were: The Obesity Society, the Obesity Action Coalition, the Obesity Medicine Association, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, the Stop Obesity Alliance, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. As part of our discussion, we agreed that it would be beneficial to come to a consensus on the definition of obesity. Our discussions led us to develop the consensus statement below to give us a shared starting point for how we talk about obesity, and which is consistent with how we discuss other chronic diseases. As the core organizations that address obesity, we worked together to write this statement and have agreed to use it as the central tenet in our communications around obesity.\nConsensus Statement\nObesity is a highly prevalent chronic disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation or distribution that presents a risk to health and requires lifelong care. Virtually every system in the body is affected by obesity. Major chronic diseases associated with obesity include diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.\nThe body mass index (weight in kg/height in meters2) is used to screen for obesity, but it does not displace clinical judgement. BMI is not a measure of body fat. Social determinants, race, ethnicity, and age may modify the risk associated with a given BMI.\nBias and stigmatization directed at people with obesity contributes to poor health and impairs treatment.\nEvery person with obesity should have access to evidence-based treatment.\nInternational Obesity Collaborative\nLearn more\nGetting ConnectedLearn moreGetting Connected\nThe Obesity Society connects with experts, government/non-government organizations and the public to:\n\nDevelop, influence and promote vital policies and public positions\nCreate and implement guidelines and cross-discipline learning, sharing and action that advances healthy behaviors\nReduce obesity-related bias\n\nSupporting InteractionsLearn moreSupporting Interactions\nThe Obesity Society works with professionals and various audiences on:\n\nValuable conferences and educational opportunities, including early-career professional development and achievement programs\nInformative professional/academic and popular publications\nEssential financial development and support\n\nIncreasing ImpactLearn moreIncreasing ImpactThe Obesity Society also helps leaders, investigators and innovators to:\n\nLaunch and promote needed public health initiatives\nTranslate basic science and clinical trial results into real-world interventions\nExpand the boundaries of scientific exploration\n\n\nContact us for more informationLooking for an obesity medicine provider in your area?\ncheck our Obesity Care Provider DirectoryNEWS YOU CAN USE\nModerate to vigorous physical activity early in the day influences weight management, health outcomes \nROCKVILLE, Md.—Even though epidemiological evidence has been controversial regarding the optimal timing of physical activity for weight management, the hours of 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. appear to be the most favorable time of day to enhance the association between daily moderate to vigorous physical activity and obesity, according to a new analysis published in Obesity, The Obesity Society’s (TOS) flagship journal.\nRead article\n\n\n\nDoctors and Advocates Call for Better Testing and Labeling of Drugs for People with Obesity\n\n\n\n\n\nTAMPA, Fla., Nov. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ — The Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) announces the publication of a “Joint Statement in Support of Closing Gaps in the Drug Approval Process and Drug Labeling for People with Obesity.” The statement is co-signed by the OAC, The Obesity Society, the Stop Obesity Alliance, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery—the leading scientific, medical, and patient advocacy organizations in support of people with obesity.\n\nRead articleTOS past presidents comment on SELECT study results \nROCKVILLE, Md.— New findings show that the medication known as Wegovy® (semaglutide) can reduce existing heart disease in patients with obesity by 20%, according to a study co-authored by past presidents of The Obesity Society (TOS) and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. “The SELECT trial is the first study showing that prescription of an anti-obesity medication in people with overweight or obesity and existing cardiovascular disease can be life-saving,” said co-author and TOS Past President Robert F.

The organizations were: The Obesity Society, the Obesity Action Coalition, the Obesity Medicine Association, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, the Stop Obesity Alliance, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. As part of our discussion, we agreed that it would be beneficial to come to a consensus on the definition of obesity. Our discussions led us to develop the consensus statement below to give us a shared starting point for how we talk about obesity, and which is consistent with how we discuss other chronic diseases. As the core organizations that address obesity, we worked together to write this statement and have agreed to use it as the central tenet in our communications around obesity.\nConsensus Statement\nObesity is a highly prevalent chronic disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation or distribution that presents a risk to health and requires lifelong care. Virtually every system in the body is affected by obesity.
