Following weight loss, peripheral and central mechanisms respond in a way similar to starvation by conveying a sense that energy reserves have dwindled, activating a strong counter-response to increase caloric intake. Moreover, metabolic rate often drops, further compounding the propensity for weight rebound. Evidence suggests these counter-regulatory adaptations may be permanent. Although research is ongoing in this area, early clues have provided valuable insight into clinical management strategies to help patients avoid weight regain. This course will review the current state of knowledge regarding mechanisms of weight regain, identify avenues of further investigation, as well as provide evidence-based clinical strategies to enhance long-term weight loss maintenance in patients with obesity.\nList of Sessions IncludedPurchase NowCME Information for Learners\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in joining a TOS Committee. \nYour request has been sent.\n\n\n\t\t\t×\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nCookies on Obesity.org\nBy using Obesity.org, you agree to our use of cookies.
