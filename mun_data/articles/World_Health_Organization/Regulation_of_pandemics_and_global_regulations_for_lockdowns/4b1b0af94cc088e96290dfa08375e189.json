Their agency and empowerment are fundamental for tackling both maternal and newborn deaths and achieving health for all. Show less Improve women and girls rights\nBeyond survival, critical investment is needed to improve women’s longer-term health and well-beingWomen everywhere need access to health providers who listen to their concerns and meet their needs – including in the months after pregnancy when millions lack critical support, despite enduring lasting health consequences after birth. Show less Critical investment is needed\nWe can end preventable maternal and newborn deathsWHO is calling for a worldwide reinvigoration of efforts to ensure access to high quality care for women and babies, especially in the poorest countries, humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings where most maternal and newborn deaths occur. Show less End preventable deaths\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for policy makers\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond survivalCompassionate and respectful care: Services must not only be safe and effective, they must also ensure women, newborns and caregivers are treated with dignity, empathy and respect. This includes compassionate care for those affected by stillbirth and miscarriage – requiring dedicated trainings for health workers and bereavement counselling for those in need.Postnatal support: Around a third of women suffer long-term health complications after childbirth, which can increase risks during future pregnancies, while up to 20% of new mothers have been estimated to experience postpartum depression or anxiety. An integrated approach to postnatal care connects physical health, mental health, and social support services in this critical period and beyond.Family-friendly policies: Family-friendly policies and laws are critical to ensure women have the right support to take care of their health and their babies, including paid maternity leave (at least 18 weeks, ideally 6 months or more), legal protections, and workplace support for breastfeeding.Empowering girls and woman: Girls’ access to education is associated with reduced likelihood of maternal death. Ensuring girls can stay in school and take decisions about their health and bodies is critical for improving their health.Show less Beyond survival\nHigh-impact investmentsAntenatal checks: High quality antenatal services – including at least eight checks with a skilled health worker and early ultrasound – are essential for all women to support healthy pregnancies, reduce risks and detect possible complications. Up to 15% of pregnant women have been estimated to develop a potentially life-threatening complication during pregnancy or birth.Lifesaving care during and after birth: At least 70% of all maternal deaths are due to direct obstetric causes like haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia; most of these fatalities occur during labour and birth, along with more than 40% of stillbirths, or shortly after delivery. Access to quality care from skilled providers during and after childbirth is critical, including vital emergency services if dangerous complications occur.Address indirect causes: Infectious diseases and pre-existing health conditions like anaemias, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and diabetes underpin nearly a quarter of maternal mortality. It is vital to improve care, prevention, and early detection of these health conditions that complicate pregnancies and increase risks for millions around the world.Immediate newborn care: Newborn deaths account for nearly 50% of deaths among children under the age of 5 globally, resulting in 2.4 million lives lost each year. All babies need essential care at birth and in their first month of life, including breastfeeding support, so they are protected from infections, can breathe normally, and are warm and well-nourished.Special attention to vulnerable babies: Complications relating to prematurity and low birth weight are the leading cause of death in newborns and children under five. Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Investing in these models, and ensuring sufficient well-trained midwives, is a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and newborn health.Access to family planning: Approximately 218 million women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries have an unmet need for modern contraception. Addressing this need can significantly reduce unintended pregnancies and related risks.Solutions for low-income contexts: Research is needed to identify cost-effective solutions that tackle the leading causes of maternal and newborn deaths, particularly targeting healthcare settings in poorer countries and fragile contexts. Show less High-impact investments\nEnding preventable deathsAchieving targets: Experience from around the world shows that progress is possible and that we can end preventable maternal and newborn deaths. These investments are not just about survival; they are about ensuring a brighter and hopeful future for women and their children.Investing in human capital: In low- and middle-income countries, every US$ 1 invested in maternal and newborn health is estimated to yield around US$ 9 to US$ 20 in return. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health is an investment in human capital, not a cost, leading to economic development and happier, healthier societies.No-one left behind: Given the high concentration of maternal and newborn deaths in humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings, ensuring impact and targeting interventions in these contexts will be critical for significantly reducing maternal and newborn deaths. Show less Ending preventable deaths\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for pregnant women\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter birthAfter pregnancy, you undergo many physical and emotional changes, which can be frightening or disconcerting. It can help to know what to expect after birth:Physical recovery: Many women experience bleeding, cramping, and discomfort, as well as fatigue. Pain relief can help. Rest when you can, don’t try and do too much in the first weeks, and ask for support as you adjust to caring for your newborn.Emotional changes: Feeling a range of emotions, including feeling blue or sad, is common in the days after birth. This is due to hormonal changes. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious. Up to 1 in 5 women experience postnatal depression or anxiety. These conditions are common and treatable with professional support. Rarer but extremely serious if not treated, postpartum psychosis can occur suddenly with symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and rapidly changing mood. This is a medical emergency requiring urgent care.Show less After birth\nDuring pregnancySeeking care: WHO recommends at least eight checks with a health professional, starting as soon as you know you are pregnant. These checks monitor your health, and your baby's development, and detect possible complications.Important tests: Expect tests like ultrasound screenings, urine tests, blood tests, blood pressure checks, glucose screening, and monitoring of your baby’s growth. These are crucial even if you feel healthy, since not all conditions result in obvious symptoms.Staying healthy: Reduce risks by attending all antenatal appointments and maintaining a healthy lifestyle:avoid tobacco and substance abuse;stay physically active;get vaccinated as recommended;sleep on your side;manage existing health conditions with medical advice; andseek help if you have concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate care if you experience: vaginal bleeding; abdominal pain; blurred vision, sudden swelling, or persistent headache; changes in baby's movements; abdominal injuries. These are not always signs of something serious but it is always best to get them checked.Baby movements: You can normally start to feel your baby moving between 16–24 weeks of pregnancy. Seek emergency care if movements decrease, stop, or become suddenly intense. Do not rely on home monitoring kits to check a baby’s heartbeat, because they will not reliably indicate all potential problems.Know your rights: All women have the right to a safe and positive pregnancy, birth, and postnatal experience where they are treated with dignity and respect; have their chosen companion by their side; enjoy clear communication from health workers; have access to appropriate pain relief, and can move around during labour and choose their own birth position. Work with your health team ahead of your expected delivery date to make decisions and get advice that supports you through labour and beyond.Here's some more information to know about maternal health. Show less During pregnancy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for parents and caregivers\n\n\n\n\n\nMiscarriage and stillbirthLosing a baby (defined as either a miscarriage or a stillbirth, depending on when in pregnancy it occurs) can happen to anyone, though certain factors – like some infections and chronic health conditions, tobacco and alcohol use – can increase risk.For parents who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirthAcknowledge your grief: Losing a baby is a unique and heartbreaking type of grief. It's important to acknowledge your feelings and understand that it's okay to grieve in your own way.Seek support: Reach out to support groups or mental health professionals. In some countries, there may be health workers who specialize in supporting people who have experienced this kind of loss. Sharing your experience with others who understand can help with the healing process.Communicate with loved ones: Let your friends and family know how they can support you. Sometimes they may not know what to say or do, so guiding them can help.Take care of yourself: Allow yourself time to heal. This might include physical rest, mental health support, and engaging in activities that bring you comfort.Plan for future pregnancies, if you wish: If you plan to conceive again, discuss with your health-care provider about any additional care or monitoring you might need. Most women who have experienced a loss go on to have healthy pregnancies.Remember, you are not alone. Many people have gone through similar experiences, and there are resources and support systems available to help you through this difficult time. If you have concerns or need support, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.Show less Miscarriage and stillbirth\nCaring for a newbornLife with a new baby can be a uniquely challenging and emotional time. Here’s some key advice to support a healthy future for your little one.Attend health check-ups: Schedule and attend all recommended newborn care appointments to monitor your baby's growth and development. These visits are crucial for early detection of any health issues.Practice safe sleep: Babies should lay on their back to sleep, on a firm mattress without soft bedding, pillows, or toys. This reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is highly beneficial for your baby, providing essential nutrients and antibodies. If breastfeeding is challenging, a trained provider can help resolve many common problems.Bonding and interaction: Spend time holding, talking to, and playing with your baby. Skin-to-skin contact and responsive interactions help with bonding and support your baby's emotional and cognitive development.Recognize signs of illness: Be aware of signs that may indicate your baby needs medical attention, such as fever, difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, diarrhoea, or unusual lethargy. Trust your instincts and seek medical advice if you have concerns.Look after your own health: When all eyes are on the baby, it can be easy to lose sight of your own health needs. But taking care of your own health helps protect you and your baby. Take time to rest, ask for support if you need it, and reach out for medical help if you find you are feeling extremely overwhelmed, sad or anxious.Warning signs: Seek urgent care for your newborn baby if they have; a fever; a rash that comes on quickly and looks like bruises or bleeding under the skin or does not fade when you put a glass on it; seizures, are floppy or difficult to wake; difficulties breathing (they may be grunting or their tummy is sucking in when they breathe); signs of jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the skin); vomiting persistently or not keeping liquids down for several hours; diarrhoea, especially if it is bloody or accompanied by a fever, dehydration signs (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, sunken soft spot on the head).Trust your instincts: If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, speak to your health worker for advice.Here's some more information to know about newborn health. Show less Caring for a newborn\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for the general public\n\n\n\n\n\nWays to get involved and supportThere are lots of ways you can get involved and support efforts to improve maternal and health:Spread awareness:  Share information about the campaign using #HopefulFutures and #HealthForAll.Participate: Attend our global events to learn more about what it will take to end maternal and newborn mortality.Donate: Donate to the WHO Foundation which supports WHO’s work to protect mothers and babies in countries around the world.Share personal experiences: Share your own experiences or stories of pregnancy and birth, and thank those who provide quality care on your own platforms.If you know someone who is pregnant, or has a new baby, there are also plenty of ways you can lean in and support them as well – checking in with them, being there for them if they need it, and offering emotional support and understanding.Show less Get involved and support\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Health Day 2025: main campaign page\n\nWorld Health Day 2025: messagesHealthy beginnings, hopeful futures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nKey messages\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter maternal health means improving the rights of women and girlsBetter maternal health means improving the rights of women and girls so that they can plan their lives and protect their health.

Here’s some key advice to support a healthy future for your little one.Attend health check-ups: Schedule and attend all recommended newborn care appointments to monitor your baby's growth and development. These visits are crucial for early detection of any health issues.Practice safe sleep: Babies should lay on their back to sleep, on a firm mattress without soft bedding, pillows, or toys. This reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is highly beneficial for your baby, providing essential nutrients and antibodies. If breastfeeding is challenging, a trained provider can help resolve many common problems.Bonding and interaction: Spend time holding, talking to, and playing with your baby. Skin-to-skin contact and responsive interactions help with bonding and support your baby's emotional and cognitive development.Recognize signs of illness: Be aware of signs that may indicate your baby needs medical attention, such as fever, difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, diarrhoea, or unusual lethargy. Trust your instincts and seek medical advice if you have concerns.Look after your own health: When all eyes are on the baby, it can be easy to lose sight of your own health needs. But taking care of your own health helps protect you and your baby. Take time to rest, ask for support if you need it, and reach out for medical help if you find you are feeling extremely overwhelmed, sad or anxious.Warning signs: Seek urgent care for your newborn baby if they have; a fever; a rash that comes on quickly and looks like bruises or bleeding under the skin or does not fade when you put a glass on it; seizures, are floppy or difficult to wake; difficulties breathing (they may be grunting or their tummy is sucking in when they breathe); signs of jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the skin); vomiting persistently or not keeping liquids down for several hours; diarrhoea, especially if it is bloody or accompanied by a fever, dehydration signs (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, sunken soft spot on the head).Trust your instincts: If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, speak to your health worker for advice.Here's some more information to know about newborn health. Show less Caring for a newborn\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for the general public\n\n\n\n\n\nWays to get involved and supportThere are lots of ways you can get involved and support efforts to improve maternal and health:Spread awareness:  Share information about the campaign using #HopefulFutures and #HealthForAll.Participate: Attend our global events to learn more about what it will take to end maternal and newborn mortality.Donate: Donate to the WHO Foundation which supports WHO’s work to protect mothers and babies in countries around the world.Share personal experiences: Share your own experiences or stories of pregnancy and birth, and thank those who provide quality care on your own platforms.If you know someone who is pregnant, or has a new baby, there are also plenty of ways you can lean in and support them as well – checking in with them, being there for them if they need it, and offering emotional support and understanding.Show less Get involved and support\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Health Day 2025: main campaign page\n\nKey messages\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter maternal health means improving the rights of women and girlsBetter maternal health means improving the rights of women and girls so that they can plan their lives and protect their health.

An integrated approach to postnatal care connects physical health, mental health, and social support services in this critical period and beyond.Family-friendly policies: Family-friendly policies and laws are critical to ensure women have the right support to take care of their health and their babies, including paid maternity leave (at least 18 weeks, ideally 6 months or more), legal protections, and workplace support for breastfeeding.Empowering girls and woman: Girls’ access to education is associated with reduced likelihood of maternal death.

Up to 15% of pregnant women have been estimated to develop a potentially life-threatening complication during pregnancy or birth.Lifesaving care during and after birth: At least 70% of all maternal deaths are due to direct obstetric causes like haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia; most of these fatalities occur during labour and birth, along with more than 40% of stillbirths, or shortly after delivery. Access to quality care from skilled providers during and after childbirth is critical, including vital emergency services if dangerous complications occur.Address indirect causes: Infectious diseases and pre-existing health conditions like anaemias, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and diabetes underpin nearly a quarter of maternal mortality. It is vital to improve care, prevention, and early detection of these health conditions that complicate pregnancies and increase risks for millions around the world.Immediate newborn care: Newborn deaths account for nearly 50% of deaths among children under the age of 5 globally, resulting in 2.4 million lives lost each year. All babies need essential care at birth and in their first month of life, including breastfeeding support, so they are protected from infections, can breathe normally, and are warm and well-nourished.Special attention to vulnerable babies: Complications relating to prematurity and low birth weight are the leading cause of death in newborns and children under five. Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Investing in these models, and ensuring sufficient well-trained midwives, is a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and newborn health.Access to family planning: Approximately 218 million women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries have an unmet need for modern contraception. Addressing this need can significantly reduce unintended pregnancies and related risks.Solutions for low-income contexts: Research is needed to identify cost-effective solutions that tackle the leading causes of maternal and newborn deaths, particularly targeting healthcare settings in poorer countries and fragile contexts. Show less High-impact investments\nEnding preventable deathsAchieving targets: Experience from around the world shows that progress is possible and that we can end preventable maternal and newborn deaths. These investments are not just about survival; they are about ensuring a brighter and hopeful future for women and their children.Investing in human capital: In low- and middle-income countries, every US$ 1 invested in maternal and newborn health is estimated to yield around US$ 9 to US$ 20 in return. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health is an investment in human capital, not a cost, leading to economic development and happier, healthier societies.No-one left behind: Given the high concentration of maternal and newborn deaths in humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings, ensuring impact and targeting interventions in these contexts will be critical for significantly reducing maternal and newborn deaths. Show less Ending preventable deaths\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for pregnant women\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter birthAfter pregnancy, you undergo many physical and emotional changes, which can be frightening or disconcerting.

Rest when you can, don’t try and do too much in the first weeks, and ask for support as you adjust to caring for your newborn.Emotional changes: Feeling a range of emotions, including feeling blue or sad, is common in the days after birth. This is due to hormonal changes. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious. Up to 1 in 5 women experience postnatal depression or anxiety. These conditions are common and treatable with professional support.

Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Investing in these models, and ensuring sufficient well-trained midwives, is a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and newborn health.Access to family planning: Approximately 218 million women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries have an unmet need for modern contraception.

Rest when you can, don’t try and do too much in the first weeks, and ask for support as you adjust to caring for your newborn.Emotional changes: Feeling a range of emotions, including feeling blue or sad, is common in the days after birth. This is due to hormonal changes. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious.

Take time to rest, ask for support if you need it, and reach out for medical help if you find you are feeling extremely overwhelmed, sad or anxious.Warning signs: Seek urgent care for your newborn baby if they have; a fever; a rash that comes on quickly and looks like bruises or bleeding under the skin or does not fade when you put a glass on it; seizures, are floppy or difficult to wake; difficulties breathing (they may be grunting or their tummy is sucking in when they breathe); signs of jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the skin); vomiting persistently or not keeping liquids down for several hours; diarrhoea, especially if it is bloody or accompanied by a fever, dehydration signs (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, sunken soft spot on the head).Trust your instincts: If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, speak to your health worker for advice.Here's some more information to know about newborn health. Show less Caring for a newborn\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for the general public\n\n\n\n\n\nWays to get involved and supportThere are lots of ways you can get involved and support efforts to improve maternal and health:Spread awareness:  Share information about the campaign using #HopefulFutures and #HealthForAll.Participate: Attend our global events to learn more about what it will take to end maternal and newborn mortality.Donate: Donate to the WHO Foundation which supports WHO’s work to protect mothers and babies in countries around the world.Share personal experiences: Share your own experiences or stories of pregnancy and birth, and thank those who provide quality care on your own platforms.If you know someone who is pregnant, or has a new baby, there are also plenty of ways you can lean in and support them as well – checking in with them, being there for them if they need it, and offering emotional support and understanding.Show less Get involved and support\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Health Day 2025: main campaign page\n\nKey messages\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter maternal health means improving the rights of women and girlsBetter maternal health means improving the rights of women and girls so that they can plan their lives and protect their health.

This includes compassionate care for those affected by stillbirth and miscarriage – requiring dedicated trainings for health workers and bereavement counselling for those in need.Postnatal support: Around a third of women suffer long-term health complications after childbirth, which can increase risks during future pregnancies, while up to 20% of new mothers have been estimated to experience postpartum depression or anxiety. An integrated approach to postnatal care connects physical health, mental health, and social support services in this critical period and beyond.Family-friendly policies: Family-friendly policies and laws are critical to ensure women have the right support to take care of their health and their babies, including paid maternity leave (at least 18 weeks, ideally 6 months or more), legal protections, and workplace support for breastfeeding.Empowering girls and woman: Girls’ access to education is associated with reduced likelihood of maternal death. Ensuring girls can stay in school and take decisions about their health and bodies is critical for improving their health.Show less Beyond survival\nHigh-impact investmentsAntenatal checks: High quality antenatal services – including at least eight checks with a skilled health worker and early ultrasound – are essential for all women to support healthy pregnancies, reduce risks and detect possible complications. Up to 15% of pregnant women have been estimated to develop a potentially life-threatening complication during pregnancy or birth.Lifesaving care during and after birth: At least 70% of all maternal deaths are due to direct obstetric causes like haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia; most of these fatalities occur during labour and birth, along with more than 40% of stillbirths, or shortly after delivery. Access to quality care from skilled providers during and after childbirth is critical, including vital emergency services if dangerous complications occur.Address indirect causes: Infectious diseases and pre-existing health conditions like anaemias, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and diabetes underpin nearly a quarter of maternal mortality. It is vital to improve care, prevention, and early detection of these health conditions that complicate pregnancies and increase risks for millions around the world.Immediate newborn care: Newborn deaths account for nearly 50% of deaths among children under the age of 5 globally, resulting in 2.4 million lives lost each year. All babies need essential care at birth and in their first month of life, including breastfeeding support, so they are protected from infections, can breathe normally, and are warm and well-nourished.Special attention to vulnerable babies: Complications relating to prematurity and low birth weight are the leading cause of death in newborns and children under five. Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Investing in these models, and ensuring sufficient well-trained midwives, is a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and newborn health.Access to family planning: Approximately 218 million women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries have an unmet need for modern contraception. Addressing this need can significantly reduce unintended pregnancies and related risks.Solutions for low-income contexts: Research is needed to identify cost-effective solutions that tackle the leading causes of maternal and newborn deaths, particularly targeting healthcare settings in poorer countries and fragile contexts. Show less High-impact investments\nEnding preventable deathsAchieving targets: Experience from around the world shows that progress is possible and that we can end preventable maternal and newborn deaths. These investments are not just about survival; they are about ensuring a brighter and hopeful future for women and their children.Investing in human capital: In low- and middle-income countries, every US$ 1 invested in maternal and newborn health is estimated to yield around US$ 9 to US$ 20 in return. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health is an investment in human capital, not a cost, leading to economic development and happier, healthier societies.No-one left behind: Given the high concentration of maternal and newborn deaths in humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings, ensuring impact and targeting interventions in these contexts will be critical for significantly reducing maternal and newborn deaths. Show less Ending preventable deaths\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for pregnant women\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter birthAfter pregnancy, you undergo many physical and emotional changes, which can be frightening or disconcerting. It can help to know what to expect after birth:Physical recovery: Many women experience bleeding, cramping, and discomfort, as well as fatigue. Pain relief can help. Rest when you can, don’t try and do too much in the first weeks, and ask for support as you adjust to caring for your newborn.Emotional changes: Feeling a range of emotions, including feeling blue or sad, is common in the days after birth. This is due to hormonal changes. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious. Up to 1 in 5 women experience postnatal depression or anxiety. These conditions are common and treatable with professional support. Rarer but extremely serious if not treated, postpartum psychosis can occur suddenly with symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and rapidly changing mood. This is a medical emergency requiring urgent care.Show less After birth\nDuring pregnancySeeking care: WHO recommends at least eight checks with a health professional, starting as soon as you know you are pregnant. These checks monitor your health, and your baby's development, and detect possible complications.Important tests: Expect tests like ultrasound screenings, urine tests, blood tests, blood pressure checks, glucose screening, and monitoring of your baby’s growth. These are crucial even if you feel healthy, since not all conditions result in obvious symptoms.Staying healthy: Reduce risks by attending all antenatal appointments and maintaining a healthy lifestyle:avoid tobacco and substance abuse;stay physically active;get vaccinated as recommended;sleep on your side;manage existing health conditions with medical advice; andseek help if you have concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate care if you experience: vaginal bleeding; abdominal pain; blurred vision, sudden swelling, or persistent headache; changes in baby's movements; abdominal injuries. These are not always signs of something serious but it is always best to get them checked.Baby movements: You can normally start to feel your baby moving between 16–24 weeks of pregnancy. Seek emergency care if movements decrease, stop, or become suddenly intense. Do not rely on home monitoring kits to check a baby’s heartbeat, because they will not reliably indicate all potential problems.Know your rights: All women have the right to a safe and positive pregnancy, birth, and postnatal experience where they are treated with dignity and respect; have their chosen companion by their side; enjoy clear communication from health workers; have access to appropriate pain relief, and can move around during labour and choose their own birth position. Work with your health team ahead of your expected delivery date to make decisions and get advice that supports you through labour and beyond.Here's some more information to know about maternal health. Show less During pregnancy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages for parents and caregivers\n\n\n\n\n\nMiscarriage and stillbirthLosing a baby (defined as either a miscarriage or a stillbirth, depending on when in pregnancy it occurs) can happen to anyone, though certain factors – like some infections and chronic health conditions, tobacco and alcohol use – can increase risk.For parents who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirthAcknowledge your grief: Losing a baby is a unique and heartbreaking type of grief. It's important to acknowledge your feelings and understand that it's okay to grieve in your own way.Seek support: Reach out to support groups or mental health professionals. In some countries, there may be health workers who specialize in supporting people who have experienced this kind of loss. Sharing your experience with others who understand can help with the healing process.Communicate with loved ones: Let your friends and family know how they can support you. Sometimes they may not know what to say or do, so guiding them can help.Take care of yourself: Allow yourself time to heal. This might include physical rest, mental health support, and engaging in activities that bring you comfort.Plan for future pregnancies, if you wish: If you plan to conceive again, discuss with your health-care provider about any additional care or monitoring you might need. Most women who have experienced a loss go on to have healthy pregnancies.Remember, you are not alone. Many people have gone through similar experiences, and there are resources and support systems available to help you through this difficult time. If you have concerns or need support, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.Show less Miscarriage and stillbirth\nCaring for a newbornLife with a new baby can be a uniquely challenging and emotional time. Here’s some key advice to support a healthy future for your little one.Attend health check-ups: Schedule and attend all recommended newborn care appointments to monitor your baby's growth and development. These visits are crucial for early detection of any health issues.Practice safe sleep: Babies should lay on their back to sleep, on a firm mattress without soft bedding, pillows, or toys. This reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is highly beneficial for your baby, providing essential nutrients and antibodies. If breastfeeding is challenging, a trained provider can help resolve many common problems.Bonding and interaction: Spend time holding, talking to, and playing with your baby. Skin-to-skin contact and responsive interactions help with bonding and support your baby's emotional and cognitive development.Recognize signs of illness: Be aware of signs that may indicate your baby needs medical attention, such as fever, difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, diarrhoea, or unusual lethargy. Trust your instincts and seek medical advice if you have concerns.Look after your own health: When all eyes are on the baby, it can be easy to lose sight of your own health needs.

Up to 15% of pregnant women have been estimated to develop a potentially life-threatening complication during pregnancy or birth.Lifesaving care during and after birth: At least 70% of all maternal deaths are due to direct obstetric causes like haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia; most of these fatalities occur during labour and birth, along with more than 40% of stillbirths, or shortly after delivery. Access to quality care from skilled providers during and after childbirth is critical, including vital emergency services if dangerous complications occur.Address indirect causes: Infectious diseases and pre-existing health conditions like anaemias, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and diabetes underpin nearly a quarter of maternal mortality. It is vital to improve care, prevention, and early detection of these health conditions that complicate pregnancies and increase risks for millions around the world.Immediate newborn care: Newborn deaths account for nearly 50% of deaths among children under the age of 5 globally, resulting in 2.4 million lives lost each year. All babies need essential care at birth and in their first month of life, including breastfeeding support, so they are protected from infections, can breathe normally, and are warm and well-nourished.Special attention to vulnerable babies: Complications relating to prematurity and low birth weight are the leading cause of death in newborns and children under five. Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Investing in these models, and ensuring sufficient well-trained midwives, is a cost-effective strategy to improve maternal and newborn health.Access to family planning: Approximately 218 million women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries have an unmet need for modern contraception.

It can help to know what to expect after birth:Physical recovery: Many women experience bleeding, cramping, and discomfort, as well as fatigue. Pain relief can help. Rest when you can, don’t try and do too much in the first weeks, and ask for support as you adjust to caring for your newborn.Emotional changes: Feeling a range of emotions, including feeling blue or sad, is common in the days after birth. This is due to hormonal changes. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious. Up to 1 in 5 women experience postnatal depression or anxiety. These conditions are common and treatable with professional support. Rarer but extremely serious if not treated, postpartum psychosis can occur suddenly with symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and rapidly changing mood. This is a medical emergency requiring urgent care.Show less After birth\nDuring pregnancySeeking care: WHO recommends at least eight checks with a health professional, starting as soon as you know you are pregnant. These checks monitor your health, and your baby's development, and detect possible complications.Important tests: Expect tests like ultrasound screenings, urine tests, blood tests, blood pressure checks, glucose screening, and monitoring of your baby’s growth. These are crucial even if you feel healthy, since not all conditions result in obvious symptoms.Staying healthy: Reduce risks by attending all antenatal appointments and maintaining a healthy lifestyle:avoid tobacco and substance abuse;stay physically active;get vaccinated as recommended;sleep on your side;manage existing health conditions with medical advice; andseek help if you have concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate care if you experience: vaginal bleeding; abdominal pain; blurred vision, sudden swelling, or persistent headache; changes in baby's movements; abdominal injuries. These are not always signs of something serious but it is always best to get them checked.Baby movements: You can normally start to feel your baby moving between 16–24 weeks of pregnancy. Seek emergency care if movements decrease, stop, or become suddenly intense. Do not rely on home monitoring kits to check a baby’s heartbeat, because they will not reliably indicate all potential problems.Know your rights: All women have the right to a safe and positive pregnancy, birth, and postnatal experience where they are treated with dignity and respect; have their chosen companion by their side; enjoy clear communication from health workers; have access to appropriate pain relief, and can move around during labour and choose their own birth position.

Here’s some key advice to support a healthy future for your little one.Attend health check-ups: Schedule and attend all recommended newborn care appointments to monitor your baby's growth and development. These visits are crucial for early detection of any health issues.Practice safe sleep: Babies should lay on their back to sleep, on a firm mattress without soft bedding, pillows, or toys. This reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is highly beneficial for your baby, providing essential nutrients and antibodies. If breastfeeding is challenging, a trained provider can help resolve many common problems.Bonding and interaction: Spend time holding, talking to, and playing with your baby. Skin-to-skin contact and responsive interactions help with bonding and support your baby's emotional and cognitive development.Recognize signs of illness: Be aware of signs that may indicate your baby needs medical attention, such as fever, difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, diarrhoea, or unusual lethargy. Trust your instincts and seek medical advice if you have concerns.Look after your own health: When all eyes are on the baby, it can be easy to lose sight of your own health needs. But taking care of your own health helps protect you and your baby. Take time to rest, ask for support if you need it, and reach out for medical help if you find you are feeling extremely overwhelmed, sad or anxious.Warning signs: Seek urgent care for your newborn baby if they have; a fever; a rash that comes on quickly and looks like bruises or bleeding under the skin or does not fade when you put a glass on it; seizures, are floppy or difficult to wake; difficulties breathing (they may be grunting or their tummy is sucking in when they breathe); signs of jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the skin); vomiting persistently or not keeping liquids down for several hours; diarrhoea, especially if it is bloody or accompanied by a fever, dehydration signs (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, sunken soft spot on the head).Trust your instincts: If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, speak to your health worker for advice.Here's some more information to know about newborn health. Show less Caring for a newborn\n\nMessages for parents and caregivers\n\n\n\n\n\nMiscarriage and stillbirthLosing a baby (defined as either a miscarriage or a stillbirth, depending on when in pregnancy it occurs) can happen to anyone, though certain factors – like some infections and chronic health conditions, tobacco and alcohol use – can increase risk.For parents who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirthAcknowledge your grief: Losing a baby is a unique and heartbreaking type of grief.

Here’s some key advice to support a healthy future for your little one.Attend health check-ups: Schedule and attend all recommended newborn care appointments to monitor your baby's growth and development. These visits are crucial for early detection of any health issues.Practice safe sleep: Babies should lay on their back to sleep, on a firm mattress without soft bedding, pillows, or toys. This reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is highly beneficial for your baby, providing essential nutrients and antibodies. If breastfeeding is challenging, a trained provider can help resolve many common problems.Bonding and interaction: Spend time holding, talking to, and playing with your baby. Skin-to-skin contact and responsive interactions help with bonding and support your baby's emotional and cognitive development.Recognize signs of illness: Be aware of signs that may indicate your baby needs medical attention, such as fever, difficulty breathing, persistent vomiting, diarrhoea, or unusual lethargy.

Show less Improve women and girls rights\nBeyond survival, critical investment is needed to improve women’s longer-term health and well-beingWomen everywhere need access to health providers who listen to their concerns and meet their needs – including in the months after pregnancy when millions lack critical support, despite enduring lasting health consequences after birth. Show less Critical investment is needed\nWe can end preventable maternal and newborn deathsWHO is calling for a worldwide reinvigoration of efforts to ensure access to high quality care for women and babies, especially in the poorest countries, humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings where most maternal and newborn deaths occur. This includes compassionate care for those affected by stillbirth and miscarriage – requiring dedicated trainings for health workers and bereavement counselling for those in need.Postnatal support: Around a third of women suffer long-term health complications after childbirth, which can increase risks during future pregnancies, while up to 20% of new mothers have been estimated to experience postpartum depression or anxiety. An integrated approach to postnatal care connects physical health, mental health, and social support services in this critical period and beyond.Family-friendly policies: Family-friendly policies and laws are critical to ensure women have the right support to take care of their health and their babies, including paid maternity leave (at least 18 weeks, ideally 6 months or more), legal protections, and workplace support for breastfeeding.Empowering girls and woman: Girls’ access to education is associated with reduced likelihood of maternal death. Ensuring girls can stay in school and take decisions about their health and bodies is critical for improving their health.Show less Beyond survival\nHigh-impact investmentsAntenatal checks: High quality antenatal services – including at least eight checks with a skilled health worker and early ultrasound – are essential for all women to support healthy pregnancies, reduce risks and detect possible complications. Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health is an investment in human capital, not a cost, leading to economic development and happier, healthier societies.No-one left behind: Given the high concentration of maternal and newborn deaths in humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings, ensuring impact and targeting interventions in these contexts will be critical for significantly reducing maternal and newborn deaths. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious. These are crucial even if you feel healthy, since not all conditions result in obvious symptoms.Staying healthy: Reduce risks by attending all antenatal appointments and maintaining a healthy lifestyle:avoid tobacco and substance abuse;stay physically active;get vaccinated as recommended;sleep on your side;manage existing health conditions with medical advice; andseek help if you have concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate care if you experience: vaginal bleeding; abdominal pain; blurred vision, sudden swelling, or persistent headache; changes in baby's movements; abdominal injuries. Take time to rest, ask for support if you need it, and reach out for medical help if you find you are feeling extremely overwhelmed, sad or anxious.Warning signs: Seek urgent care for your newborn baby if they have; a fever; a rash that comes on quickly and looks like bruises or bleeding under the skin or does not fade when you put a glass on it; seizures, are floppy or difficult to wake; difficulties breathing (they may be grunting or their tummy is sucking in when they breathe); signs of jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the skin); vomiting persistently or not keeping liquids down for several hours; diarrhoea, especially if it is bloody or accompanied by a fever, dehydration signs (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, sunken soft spot on the head).Trust your instincts: If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, speak to your health worker for advice.Here's some more information to know about newborn health.

An integrated approach to postnatal care connects physical health, mental health, and social support services in this critical period and beyond.Family-friendly policies: Family-friendly policies and laws are critical to ensure women have the right support to take care of their health and their babies, including paid maternity leave (at least 18 weeks, ideally 6 months or more), legal protections, and workplace support for breastfeeding.Empowering girls and woman: Girls’ access to education is associated with reduced likelihood of maternal death. Ensuring girls can stay in school and take decisions about their health and bodies is critical for improving their health.Show less Beyond survival\nHigh-impact investmentsAntenatal checks: High quality antenatal services – including at least eight checks with a skilled health worker and early ultrasound – are essential for all women to support healthy pregnancies, reduce risks and detect possible complications. Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health is an investment in human capital, not a cost, leading to economic development and happier, healthier societies.No-one left behind: Given the high concentration of maternal and newborn deaths in humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings, ensuring impact and targeting interventions in these contexts will be critical for significantly reducing maternal and newborn deaths. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious. These are crucial even if you feel healthy, since not all conditions result in obvious symptoms.Staying healthy: Reduce risks by attending all antenatal appointments and maintaining a healthy lifestyle:avoid tobacco and substance abuse;stay physically active;get vaccinated as recommended;sleep on your side;manage existing health conditions with medical advice; andseek help if you have concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate care if you experience: vaginal bleeding; abdominal pain; blurred vision, sudden swelling, or persistent headache; changes in baby's movements; abdominal injuries. Take time to rest, ask for support if you need it, and reach out for medical help if you find you are feeling extremely overwhelmed, sad or anxious.Warning signs: Seek urgent care for your newborn baby if they have; a fever; a rash that comes on quickly and looks like bruises or bleeding under the skin or does not fade when you put a glass on it; seizures, are floppy or difficult to wake; difficulties breathing (they may be grunting or their tummy is sucking in when they breathe); signs of jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the skin); vomiting persistently or not keeping liquids down for several hours; diarrhoea, especially if it is bloody or accompanied by a fever, dehydration signs (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, sunken soft spot on the head).Trust your instincts: If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, speak to your health worker for advice.Here's some more information to know about newborn health.
