  "text": "About National Societies\n\n\n The IFRC is made up of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, often referred to as National Societies, present in nearly every country of the world. Their roles differ country by country, but they are all united by our Fundamental Principles and all strive for the good of humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            What are National Societies?\n      \n\n\n\n\nNational Societies are the backbone of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Each one is made up of an unparalleled network of community-based volunteers and staff who provide a wide variety of services. \nThe specific role of National Societies and the services they provide varies country by country. This is due to the different needs of communities, as well as the different relationships National Societies have with their respective authorities.\nNational Society volunteers are often first on the scene when a disaster strikes. And they remain active within affected communities long after everyone else has left. In some cases, National Societies are the only organizations able to operate in countries experiencing disasters, conflicts, or a collapse in their social fabric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Directory\n      \n\n\n            Find your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n      \n\n\n\n\n      View the directory\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The auxiliary role\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of medical workers from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent move a patient on a stretcher towards a waiting ambulance in the snow in Homs\nPhoto:\n                    Syrian Arab Red Crescent/Abdulaziz Al-droubi\n      \n\n\n\n\nNational Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are neither governmental institutions nor wholly separate non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

And they remain active within affected communities long after everyone else has left. In some cases, National Societies are the only organizations able to operate in countries experiencing disasters, conflicts, or a collapse in their social fabric.\n\nNational Societies are the backbone of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Each one is made up of an unparalleled network of community-based volunteers and staff who provide a wide variety of services.\n\nThe specific role of National Societies and the services they provide varies country by country. This is due to the different needs of communities, as well as the different relationships National Societies have with their respective authorities.\n\nNational Society volunteers are often first on the scene when a disaster strikes. And they remain active within affected communities long after everyone else has left. In some cases, National Societies are the only organizations able to operate in countries experiencing disasters, conflicts, or a collapse in their social fabric.\n\nDirectory\n      \n\n\n            Find your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n      \n\n\n\n\n      View the directory\n\nDirectory\n      \n\n\n            Find your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n      \n\n\n\n\n      View the directory\n\nDirectory\n      \n\n\n            Find your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n      \n\n\n\n\n      View the directory\n\nDirectory\n      \n\n\n            Find your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n      \n\n\n\n\n      View the directory\n\nDirectory\n      \n\n\n            Find your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n      \n\n\n\n\n      View the directory\n\nDirectory\n      \n\n\n            Find your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n      \n\n\n\n\n      View the directory\n\nDirectory\n\nFind your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n\nFind your local Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in our directory\n\nView the directory\n\nThe auxiliary role\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of medical workers from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent move a patient on a stretcher towards a waiting ambulance in the snow in Homs\nPhoto:\n                    Syrian Arab Red Crescent/Abdulaziz Al-droubi\n      \n\n\n\n\nNational Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are neither governmental institutions nor wholly separate non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
