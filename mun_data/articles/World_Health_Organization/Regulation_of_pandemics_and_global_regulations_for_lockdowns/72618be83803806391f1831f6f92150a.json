Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco.

The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.\"Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.\"Even one life lost is far too many.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members.

He was severely injured and died before reaching hospital.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the killing. Healthcare workers must be respected and protected in every situation.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the man’s family and to his colleagues in the Ethiopian Red Cross.\r\n\r\nSince the start of the year, seven members of the IFRC network teams lost their lives while carrying out their life-saving humanitarian work.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis.

More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers.

These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.\"Even one life lost is far too many.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile.

Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.\"Even one life lost is far too many.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.\"Even one life lost is far too many.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person.

I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.\"Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

Woldu Aregawi Berha – an ambulance driver – was shot while in a vehicle clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem. He was severely injured and died before reaching hospital.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the killing. Healthcare workers must be respected and protected in every situation.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the man’s family and to his colleagues in the Ethiopian Red Cross.\r\n\r\nSince the start of the year, seven members of the IFRC network teams lost their lives while carrying out their life-saving humanitarian work.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco.

It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.\"Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control. Today, we call on authorities and governments to uphold international humanitarian principles and ensure the protection of those who risk their lives to provide critical assistance. The world needs humanitarians more than ever. It’s time to #ActForHumanity.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

Woldu Aregawi Berha – an ambulance driver – was shot while in a vehicle clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem. He was severely injured and died before reaching hospital.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the killing.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024. As their work continues, the IFRC has launched anEmergency Appeal to support the work of Philippine Red Cross in helping communities to recover and rebuild.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’\nWalking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Like the majority of volunteers from other organizations who were killed, most were local first responders, people like Fadi Al-Maani. Ordinary people, doing extraordinary things for others.“If you're a first responder, you're an extraordinary human being facing different and often terrifying situations, working tirelessly day and night,” says Jihad, adding that the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza has tested him even more than prior conflicts.“I've lived through the wars in the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021. However, this war, which began in October 2023 is the longest, most intense and most violent. It has led to the highest number of casualties and injuries.”Memories of lost colleagues and of harrowing, painful experiences are also never far from the mind of fellow Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Kamal Ahmad. “The most painful aspect of this war is the loss of those dearest to you — your friend, your brother, your colleague,” he says.But this is not the only emotional challenge that volunteers here face.“The most harrowing experience I had in the war was when we were called out to respond to the bombing in Deir al-Balah camp,” says Ahmad, who ended up transporting in the ambulance no less than 18 people that day. “It was extremely difficult for me because most of those we transported were children and women.”Volunteers also face daysofextreme frustrationwhen trying to help others,as challenges of working in a war zone get in the way.“We have faced challenges such as reaching injured people, hospital closures, insufficient equipment and medical staff,” recounts Jihad. “We have worked tirelessly, day and night without breaks or respite.“The most draining aspect was the blocked roads, which left me stuck in the hospital while my family was displaced living in a tent in Al-Mawasi and I was unable to communicate with them or know anything about them.”Volunteers can also be personally touched by the violence. “Receiving news of a strike near my house was agonizing,” says Ahmad. “I was distraught; I rushed out of the medical center and went home to check on my loved ones and help them evacuate. It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. “This is an enormous opportunity for humankind to act preventatively, to address issues ahead of any potential disasters,” says Sancin, an international law expert who serves as Vice-President of the Slovenian Red Cross and as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco.

It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. This includes psychoeducation projects and school tutoring aimed at reducing school dropouts. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nJoint statement issued 22 October 2024 by IFRC President Kate Forbes and Secretary General Jagan Chapagain at the IFRC General Assembly.\nWe continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent.

Now as he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, he talks about the challenges that defined his tenure. “Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he says in this special episode, recorded during the IFRC Youth Forum and released on the first day of the IFRC General Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 18/10/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nThe Red Family Fund\nThe Red Family Fund honours volunteers and staff from National Societies who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.\"Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control. Today, we call on authorities and governments to uphold international humanitarian principles and ensure the protection of those who risk their lives to provide critical assistance. The world needs humanitarians more than ever. It’s time to #ActForHumanity. Don’t look away”.Event Details:What: Stand in Solidarity EventWhen: Monday, 19 August 2024, at 14:00Where: Main entrance of IFRC Headquarters, GenevaFor more information or to set up an interview contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 7084367 and Andrew Thomas: +41 76 3676587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nStand with us to Protect Humanity\nViolence against humanitarian workers and volunteers must stop.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Day: Menstruation doesn't stop during disasters  \nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill. Ever since, the rain has not stopped, and the needs have grown exponentially. More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. As they endeavor to protect the lives of others, however, they face great risks. Too often, they make the ultimate sacrifice. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12/01/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: IFRC condemns killing of Ethiopian Red Cross ambulance driver\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is devastated to confirm the killing of an on-duty Ethiopian Red Cross staff member in the northern Tigray region of the country. Woldu Aregawi Berha – an ambulance driver – was shot while in a vehicle clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem. He was severely injured and died before reaching hospital.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the killing. Healthcare workers must be respected and protected in every situation.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the man’s family and to his colleagues in the Ethiopian Red Cross.\r\n\r\nSince the start of the year, seven members of the IFRC network teams lost their lives while carrying out their life-saving humanitarian work. This is unacceptable.

The urgent need for swift and effective action has never been greater.\r\n\r\nBenoit Carpentier, IFRC spokesperson, said:\r\n\r\n\"A deteriorating road network, particularly in isolated mountain villages, is making the distribution of essential supplies a race against time. We are deeply concerned about the imminent weather conditions. The Moroccan Red Crescent’s local knowledge is invaluable. They are our guiding force, making sure that our response is as effective as possible. We must continue to mobilize support for the weeks and months ahead to ensure that no community, no individual, is left behind.\"\r\n\r\nHundreds of Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers are on the ground, providing a lifeline in affected regions. Immediate relief measures include provision of first aid.\r\n\r\nM'hamed En-Nosse, Director of Operations and Regional Coordinator of Rescue and First Aid for the Moroccan Red Crescent in the Marrakesh-Safi region, said:\r\n\r\n\"Moroccan Red Crescent volunteers have been responding to the emergency since the first hours following the earthquake. We are now mobilizing all our forces in collaboration with public authorities and with the support of the IFRC to assist those who have lost everything before the arrival of rain and cold weather. The journey ahead is long, but we will stand by the side of those affected for as long as necessary.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immediate needs for food and water have been met due to the strong community solidarity, safe shelter and sanitation remain a significant concern. Makeshift settlements are still home to thousands of families who require essential items ranging from mattresses and blankets to cooking utensils and hygiene supplies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the need for solar-powered lighting and safety measures is increasingly apparent, especially in areas where restoring electricity will take weeks. As colder weather approaches, the likelihood of people cooking indoors and using gas heaters rises, elevating the risk of fires. In this context, financial support is critical for local procurement of essential supplies that address both immediate and evolving needs.\r\n\r\nOn 12 September, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss Francs (CHF) to direct overwhelming support from individuals both within Morocco and the international community. It aims to support the Moroccan Red Crescent in efforts ranging from immediate relief like health services, clean water, and sanitation, to medium-term solutions like community engagement and livelihood support.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nYour contribution can make an immediate difference.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable.

This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\n07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nArticle\n\nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific?

We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\n03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nTwo years later, a survivor of the Türkiye-Syria earthquake is seeing a better, safer and healthier future\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake. Among the survivors is Canan, a mother of four who, along with her family, resides in a container city in Hatay.Canan’s story is one of perseverance despite physical and emotional scars. “During the earthquake, a wall collapsed on my face and back,” she recalls. “I was badly injured. That period was incredibly painful. For a while, I was bedridden. I went through long treatments. Now, I can walk without a walker”.While Canan regained her mobility after her prolonged treatment, she also lost vision in one eye due to debris falling on her face. What affected her most deeply was losing her eyelid, which left her unable to close one of her eyes.“I couldn’t bear to look in the mirror. I always felt bad seeing myself like that and didn’t want to go outside,” she said, reflecting on the emotional toll the experience took on her.Not aloneFortunately, Canan did not have to face this enormous life challenge on her own. Along the way, her psychological recovery has been supported by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), which provided trauma counseling for earthquake survivors. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. “I didn't want to show my face to anyone. I even got over that. Now I am very confident. I am normal. One of my eyes is blind, but I still have many friends and loved ones.”Comfortable and confidentAnother significant impact of the earthquakes was her intense fear of entering buildings, a common reaction among survivors. \"I couldn’t enter concrete buildings before. I was terrified. But after receiving weekly psychological support from the Turkish Red Crescent for several months, I began to overcome it.”Canan can now get into the buildings, even into high-rise ones.“For the first time after the earthquake, I even went to my sister’s apartment on the 12th floor. Before the psychological support, I wasn’t even going outside. Now I feel more comfortable, more confident. I feel much better,\" she explained.The earthquakes left millions without homes or livelihoods, and vulnerable groups have been particularly affected. For individuals like Canan, who faced both physical and psychological challenges, these support mechanisms offer a crucial lifeline, enabling survivors to regain their dignity and rebuild their lives.A better life aheadA recent survey showed that the cash assistance programme is having a concrete, measurable impact. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\n03/02/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nArticle\n\nThe devastating earthquakes that struck southern Türkiye in 2023 affected millions of lives, leaving destruction and hardship in their wake.

Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulancevolunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies:“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of theservices we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregatedto highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild. As we mark International Volunteer Day [December 5], she shares her story of perseverance, compassion and courage“My journey with the Philippine Red Cross began in school, where my classmates and I were encouraged to volunteer. We first got involved on World CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) Day, where we were taught the basics. During the training, we thought, 'Wow, they're so skilled even though they’re so young!' After that, I thought, 'I want to know how this volunteering works; I want to try it myself.'I realized that being a Red Cross volunteer isn't just about showing up—there’s a lot of training involved. So at first, it felt like just a small effort, but eventually, it became more challenging and meaningful.Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’After volunteering at the Marikina chapter for a while, I was asked if I wanted to join a deployment. My first deployment took me to the eruption of the Taal volcano [in the Province of Batangas].My first task was preparing hot meals. I didn’t even know how to cook properly back then! But in the Red Cross, as a leader once told me, you need to be multitasking—you can’t just know one thing.I’ll never forget the Taal deployment. I still remember the ashfall—it was so intense, I couldn’t breathe. I was shaking, and I thought, 'Lord, is this it? Will I be okay?'Every time I joined a deployment, the thought would cross my mind: ‘What if something happens, and I don’t make it back to my family?’But when I see the people in the community who really need help, it feels like everything else doesn’t matter anymore. When I see how much they’re suffering, I can set aside my fears and just do what I can to help.With the typhoons, I have been supporting in a lot of different ways, especially in the evacuation centres. What’s important is that people know they’re not just a number, a statistic, to us.We genuinely want to hear how they are feeling and do what we can to help. For children, the impact of the back-to-back storms has been especially overwhelming. Every time it rains, even just a bit, I can see they get scared—they’re afraid it will start to flood again.When I see the children enjoying themselves, I feel relieved. But sometimes, when they start getting bored or upset, that’s when I know I need to step in and come up with a new activity or strategy to keep their spirits up.Singing and dancing to songs like ‘Baby Shark’ may seem simple but seeing the children happy made it all worthwhile. Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.While we bring essential supplies, I believe what makes us unique is that we bring support and comfort too. One person said, ‘You became like family to us.’ They felt cared for and helped in a way they hadn't before.Their joy reminds me why we do this work—to bring comfort, even in small ways, when everything else seems lost.In the end, I’m proud to be with the Red Cross. I'm proud of the deployments I’ve been part of, and I’m grateful to my mentors at the Red Cross who have been like second parents to me, always supporting me in my studies and personal growth.When someone expresses their gratitude, saying, 'Thank you, ma’am, for coming,' even when you haven’t given them much—just a simple greeting, asking them how they are—that’s something you can’t forget. Those moments when you can show them someone cares, that’s the time I realize what volunteering is all about.”Philippine Red Cross has deployed over 4,000 volunteers to support communities in response to the six typhoons that hit the country from October to November 2024.

It was a tragedy in itself. I deeply miss my friends and family.“I lost several cherished individuals. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. “Violence and neglect in childhood create deep societal impacts, fueling cycles of poverty, health issues, and instability. We are at a critical point: the world must commit to safeguarding children across all ages, genders, and abilities.”Violence and climate disasters are among the most urgent threats to children. Half of the world’s children are still unable to exercise their right to live free from violence, which remains pervasive in both daily and humanitarian settings. Children are exposed to physical, emotional, and sexual violence in spaces meant to protect them, such as homes, schools, and communities.Simultaneously, climate-related disasters — floods, heatwaves, and storms — are increasing the risk of harm, displacement, and exploitation for children. As climate emergencies escalate, so must investment in child protection, focusing on early warning, early action, and proactive measures to safeguard children before disasters strike. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. They work to ensure safe, equal, and uninterrupted access to quality, inclusive education and learning opportunities. Scaling up these evidence-based initiatives is essential to advancing child protection and achieving the goals of this Ministerial Conference.IFRC Vice President Natia Loladze, said, \"We know children are tremendously at risk in disasters, conflicts and health crises. The time to act is now. Protecting children in humanitarian and displacement settings is both a moral obligation and an investment in the future.\"The IFRC’s 2025-2028 Appeal: Ending Violence Against Children in and Through Education mobilizes partnerships with schools, communities, and public institutions to create safe environments and reduce risks in emergencies. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. Judith Carvajal de Álvarez. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco.

The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. She stressed the urgent need to protect people living in places impacted by conflict and violence and she emphasized the critical role National Societies play in supporting and accompanying communities in their path toward recovery.Audience members were also given a chance to express themselves as participants responded to critical humanitarian questions via mobile phone apps. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. “It's time for you, as young leaders, to show us the way.\"The outgoing chair of the Youth Commision, Bas van Rossum, agreed. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. “So, it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”Fostering youth leadershipThe forum was also a chance for young leaders to meet directly with senior IFRC leadership. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. She noted that poverty and unemployment often contribute to migration.Djamira Zorom from the Burkinabe Red Cross Society described the challenges that female leaders face in Africa. She explained that she had to work hard to gain the trust of her superiors and prove herself as a capable woman in a leadership position.Johnson Apamumu from the Papua New Guinea Red Cross highlighted the generational gap as a significant issue facing young people.

Even when it is recognized, it is often extremely challenging to pay adequate attention to this critical need given the pressures of daily work life. We talked to some ofour colleagues in the IFRC’s Beirut office, which oversees the MENA region, about the realities of maintaining their psychological well-being, even as conflict escalates around them.“In theory, the idea of ‘taking care of one's mental health’ or ‘disconnecting’ sounds simple. But in practice, especially in high-stress situations like those we face in the MENA region, it is incredibly difficult. The pressure to constantly be available, to support colleagues, to follow up on emergencies, and to manage personal stressors leaves little room for true disconnection.“Lebanon is a prime example of how complex and intertwined mental health struggles can be. IFRC staff are grappling with ongoing uncertainty,some of us are displaced, others are not sleeping;the emotional toll is high, and yet we cannot put our work on hold.The weight of expectations versus reality can feel overwhelming, and that strain only intensifies when compounded by the crises happening around us. How can we remain productive under these conditions? This is our main challenge right now.”Ibrahim Chaaya, IFRC MENA Staff Health Senior Officer“The problem with a lot of mental health tips is that they have been developed during peacetime, in peaceful situations, for people dealing with diverse stressful situations, but not war. You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\n10/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\n10/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nArticle\n\nIn a region as vast and diverse at the Middle East and North Africa (often referred to as the MENA region), where political instability, economic hardship, and natural hazards often overlap, mental health is often the first casualty.Yetmental health and psychosocial support too often remains one of the least prioritized aspects of overall health.

You can disconnect from work, from a dispute you had with someone, from the news, but you cannot ask a person to disconnect when they are the news, when all they can hear is bombings and drones all day long.I cannot be asked to disconnect when an airstrike shakes my home, my bed and my heart every time I try to close my eyes and get some sleep.We should take a step back and rethink the mental health methods and tools we are using, perhaps we should make them more contextualized, realistic, and therefore effective.\"Rima El Basst, IFRC MENA Community Health Assistant“Honestly, I’m not okay. Physically, I’m fine, but I’m generally not okay. Sometimes I feel numb, sometimes I cry out of the blue, sometimes I just feel unreal. There’s a mix of emotions and I cannot put it into words. You can use all the tools and do all the therapy, but it’s impossible to disconnect and it’s extremely difficult to take care of one’s mental health.“There are constant feelings of guilt and anxiety. I’m even scared of sleeping and I cannot hear a loud sound anymore without thinking that it’s an airstrike. I’ve been trying to take care of myself by doing little things, like finding support in other people by talking to them, but it’s just not enough.”Yasmin Hakim, IFRC MENA Migration Senior Officer“As a Communications Officer in emergencies, I am constantly connected to crises that never end. The challenge isn’t just the intensity of our work, but how the inability to disconnect deeply affects our mental health.Our digital presence mirrors the urgency and chaos of the real world, with each notification, post, and message bringing us closer to the heart of disasters. The pressure to stay engaged 24/7 blurs the line between personal time and professional duty, leaving little room for recovery. While we’re dedicated to our work, the toll on our mental health is often unseen but deeply felt—a cost that’s hard to ignore in the face of constant crises.”Joanna Daou, IFRC MENA Communications OfficerLearn more about how IFRC works to protect the psychological well-being of staff, volunteers and people impacted by crisis.Mental health and psychosocial support/IFRCWorld Mental Health Day: By helping others, a young volunteer learned how to help herselfUruguayan Red Cross project sends life-saving message: the lives of young people cannot be left just to chance – suicide is preventable5 top tips on maintaining mental health from Red Cross first-respondersBreaking the silence: addressing mental health and fighting stigma in the aftermath of Ukraine's conflictEuropean Mental Health Week: The healing power of art helps people cope with the upheaval caused by conflict\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\n08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  \nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\n08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\n08/10/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nPodcast\n\nThe vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. “More than 95 per cent of the humanitarians killed have been from local communities,” says Chapagain, who called on UN member states to protect aid workers and to take urgent action on a wide range of humanitarian concerns.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\n06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.

These brave individuals dedicated their lives to alleviating human suffering but became victims of the violence they sought to mitigate.Let me be unequivocal: nothing can justify killing humanitarian aid workers, whose mission of peace, care, and compassion transcends all political boundaries. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. The ongoing hostilities and their intensification, witnessed again on 8 June, hinder a dignified humanitarian response that addresses physical and mental needs. The IFRC network, is ready to scale up our response, but hostilities must cease.Moreover, nothing can justify abduction and hostage-taking of innocent people. Such acts inflict deep psychological scars and violate basic human decency and international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally.Perhaps most distressing is the indifference that allows such suffering to continue before our very eyes. We witness the anguish of loss, the desperation for necessities, and the hopelessness of unending violence.Humanitarian assistance alone is not a solution to this crisis. I urge this assembly to intensify all diplomatic efforts to bring this conflict to an end and secure, safe, unconditional and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza.We must not allow indifference to erode our shared humanity.The people of Gaza deserve more than our sympathy—they deserve our action.Thank you.\n\nRead more\n\n12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\n12/06/2024\n\n       | Speech\n\nSpeech\n\nExcellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel.

More than 80,000 people remain in temporary shelters and need help urgently.While all these disruptions may have impeded supply chains or made basic living supplies harder to find, they have not interrupted the natural menstruation cycles of half of the people impacted by these floods.\"One of the problems we face in dealing with the flood emergency in Brazil is the difficulty in getting access menstrual hygiene and menstrual health products\", reported Dr. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. \"In many communities, this topic is still taboo,\" Dr. Klock notes. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. Education and awareness-raisingWe work to ensure that people are informed about the menstrual cycle, so that they know how to manage their menstrual hygiene in difficult conditions, where to access products and how to dispose of them.To ensure menstrual health, the involvement of the whole community, including boys and men, is key. Knowing about the menstrual cycle helps to reduce stigma, promotes collective accompaniment, and helps to care for health and promote well-being.Some actions in this area are group meetings and consultation processes to learn about the specific needs of menstruating people.Psychosocial supportIt is possible that during emergencies, menstruation is stigmatized. So it is necessary to provide psychosocial support and create an environment where people can talk openly, without taboos, with a focus on Protection, Gender and Inclusion. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\n28/05/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nArticle\n\nWhen heavy rains led to massive floods in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in May, normal life for 2.3 million people came to a standstill.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco.

It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop.

Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent.

This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 26/11/2024\n\n       | Podcast\n\nInternational law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology \nWith new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers.

The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme \"Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld\" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 15/05/2024\n\n       | Basic page\n\nIn memoriam\nWhen crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \nGeneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 04/12/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nInternational Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons\nIn the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained.

At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being\".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the \"Action and Coexistence Program,\" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and \"Blue Schools,\" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, \"Bobo and Teedee,\" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 23/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nFrom Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat\nAs Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.\"I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.\"We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.\"While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says.

Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.
