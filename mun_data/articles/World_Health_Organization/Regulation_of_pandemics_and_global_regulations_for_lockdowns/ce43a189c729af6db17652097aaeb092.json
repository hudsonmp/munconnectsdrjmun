Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30. We stand with Palestine Red Crescent and the loved ones of those killed on this darkest of days.”For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 29/03/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: The IFRC calls for access and information on the fate of nine missing Palestine Red Crescent medics \nGeneva, 29 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is standing with the Palestine Red Crescent and calling for urgent access and information following seven days of silence on the fate of nine medics in Gaza.The IFRC is gravely concerned for the ambulance crews of the Palestine Red Crescentwho came under heavy gunfire while responding in the early hours of 23 March in the Al-Hashashin area of Rafah. Since then, there has been no communication with the teams.International Humanitarian Law is clear that humanitarian and healthcare workers must be protected and respected.It is vital that there is information and access to ensure the safe return of these humanitarians to their families who are living in a nightmare without knowing if their loved ones are alive.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11/02/2025\n\n       | Podcast\n\nSpeaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  \nMost people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

They were killed when the ambulance was hit on the 10th of January 2024.\r\n\r\nYoussef Abu Muammar was the ambulance’s driver. Fadi Fouad Al-Maani was a paramedic. Islam Abu Riyala was a first responder, while Fouad Abu Khamash was a volunteer. All were killed while on duty, in a vehicle clearly marked with the protective Red Crescent emblem. \r\n\r\nThese deaths are shocking and completely unacceptable. Under International Humanitarian Law, ambulances, healthcare workers and their patients must be respected and protected. Tragically Youssef, Islam, Fadi and Fouad bring to eight the number of PRCS staff and volunteers killed on duty in Gaza since October.\r\n\r\nWe send our deepest condolences to the families of those killed and all those in the Palestine Red Crescent Society.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end.

They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people. Both the violence and the siege need to end.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30. We stand with Palestine Red Crescent and the loved ones of those killed on this darkest of days.”For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 29/03/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: The IFRC calls for access and information on the fate of nine missing Palestine Red Crescent medics \nGeneva, 29 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is standing with the Palestine Red Crescent and calling for urgent access and information following seven days of silence on the fate of nine medics in Gaza.The IFRC is gravely concerned for the ambulance crews of the Palestine Red Crescentwho came under heavy gunfire while responding in the early hours of 23 March in the Al-Hashashin area of Rafah.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.

This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people. Both the violence and the siege need to end.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members.

Islam Abu Riyala was a first responder, while Fouad Abu Khamash was a volunteer. All were killed while on duty, in a vehicle clearly marked with the protective Red Crescent emblem. \r\n\r\nThese deaths are shocking and completely unacceptable. Under International Humanitarian Law, ambulances, healthcare workers and their patients must be respected and protected. Tragically Youssef, Islam, Fadi and Fouad bring to eight the number of PRCS staff and volunteers killed on duty in Gaza since October.\r\n\r\nWe send our deepest condolences to the families of those killed and all those in the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Healthcare facilities and healthcare workers must be protected and respected in every situation.\r\n\r\nAny attack onhealth care workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable. We forcefully reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Crescent emblem and the crucial humanitarian services it represents.\r\n\r\nMore information, [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\r\nAndrew Thomas: +41 76 367 65 87\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 05/01/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: IFRC condemns the attacks on Al-Amal Hospital and urges increased respect for the protective Red Crescent emblem  \nGeneva/Beirut, 5 January 2024\r\n\r\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is appalled by the continuous shelling of the Al-Amal Hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) headquarters in Khan Yunis. These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people. Both the violence and the siege need to end.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

They were killed when the ambulance was hit on the 10th of January 2024.\r\n\r\nYoussef Abu Muammar was the ambulance’s driver. Fadi Fouad Al-Maani was a paramedic.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

They were killed when the ambulance was hit on the 10th of January 2024.\r\n\r\nYoussef Abu Muammar was the ambulance’s driver. Fadi Fouad Al-Maani was a paramedic. Islam Abu Riyala was a first responder, while Fouad Abu Khamash was a volunteer. All were killed while on duty, in a vehicle clearly marked with the protective Red Crescent emblem. \r\n\r\nThese deaths are shocking and completely unacceptable. Under International Humanitarian Law, ambulances, healthcare workers and their patients must be respected and protected. Tragically Youssef, Islam, Fadi and Fouad bring to eight the number of PRCS staff and volunteers killed on duty in Gaza since October.\r\n\r\nWe send our deepest condolences to the families of those killed and all those in the Palestine Red Crescent Society.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end.

PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict.

Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30. We stand with Palestine Red Crescent and the loved ones of those killed on this darkest of days.”For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 29/03/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: The IFRC calls for access and information on the fate of nine missing Palestine Red Crescent medics \nGeneva, 29 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is standing with the Palestine Red Crescent and calling for urgent access and information following seven days of silence on the fate of nine medics in Gaza.The IFRC is gravely concerned for the ambulance crews of the Palestine Red Crescentwho came under heavy gunfire while responding in the early hours of 23 March in the Al-Hashashin area of Rafah.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end.

PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict.

Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks.

Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave.

The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried.

In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30. We stand with Palestine Red Crescent and the loved ones of those killed on this darkest of days.”For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 29/03/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: The IFRC calls for access and information on the fate of nine missing Palestine Red Crescent medics \nGeneva, 29 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is standing with the Palestine Red Crescent and calling for urgent access and information following seven days of silence on the fate of nine medics in Gaza.The IFRC is gravely concerned for the ambulance crews of the Palestine Red Crescentwho came under heavy gunfire while responding in the early hours of 23 March in the Al-Hashashin area of Rafah. Since then, there has been no communication with the teams.International Humanitarian Law is clear that humanitarian and healthcare workers must be protected and respected.It is vital that there is information and access to ensure the safe return of these humanitarians to their families who are living in a nightmare without knowing if their loved ones are alive.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11/02/2025\n\n       | Podcast\n\nSpeaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  \nMost people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support.

PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30. We stand with Palestine Red Crescent and the loved ones of those killed on this darkest of days.”For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 29/03/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: The IFRC calls for access and information on the fate of nine missing Palestine Red Crescent medics \nGeneva, 29 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is standing with the Palestine Red Crescent and calling for urgent access and information following seven days of silence on the fate of nine medics in Gaza.The IFRC is gravely concerned for the ambulance crews of the Palestine Red Crescentwho came under heavy gunfire while responding in the early hours of 23 March in the Al-Hashashin area of Rafah. Since then, there has been no communication with the teams.International Humanitarian Law is clear that humanitarian and healthcare workers must be protected and respected.It is vital that there is information and access to ensure the safe return of these humanitarians to their families who are living in a nightmare without knowing if their loved ones are alive.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11/02/2025\n\n       | Podcast\n\nSpeaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  \nMost people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace.

However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people. Both the violence and the siege need to end.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages. Now.\r\n\n\nRead more\n\nInternational Humanitarian law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying 1 - 14 of 14\n\nInternational Humanitarian law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying 1 - 14 of 14\n\nInternational Humanitarian law\n\nDisplaying 1 - 14 of 14\n\nDisplaying 1 - 14 of 14\n\n04/04/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nWith too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world\nGeneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30. We stand with Palestine Red Crescent and the loved ones of those killed on this darkest of days.”For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 29/03/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: The IFRC calls for access and information on the fate of nine missing Palestine Red Crescent medics \nGeneva, 29 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is standing with the Palestine Red Crescent and calling for urgent access and information following seven days of silence on the fate of nine medics in Gaza.The IFRC is gravely concerned for the ambulance crews of the Palestine Red Crescentwho came under heavy gunfire while responding in the early hours of 23 March in the Al-Hashashin area of Rafah.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.

This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people. Both the violence and the siege need to end.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people. Both the violence and the siege need to end.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages. Now.\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n04/04/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nWith too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world\nGeneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. These days, it also means standing up for local people who try to help their vulnerable neighbours. “By far the majority of humanitarian workers killed or injured in crisis situations are local workers,” he says. “That has to change and be recognized as a critical issue for the global community.”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/10/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territory: After a year of suffering, humanity must prevail\n\"The world remains on edge.Hostages must come home. Bombs must stop falling. Aid must be allowed to get to where it’s needed most.7 October marks one year since the horrific attacks that led to a major escalation of armed hostilities in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The urgent need for peace and stability has never been clearer. However, political and diplomatic efforts have yet to achieve this.Humanitarian assistance cannot replace political will.Twelve months later, the situation is still dire and its impact is spreading. Millions of people are desperate for humanitarian assistance. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

They were killed when the ambulance was hit on the 10th of January 2024.\r\n\r\nYoussef Abu Muammar was the ambulance’s driver. Fadi Fouad Al-Maani was a paramedic.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people. Both the violence and the siege need to end.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support.

PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people.

Citing a deteriorating security situation and military threats, these decisions come at a time of rising international tensions and armed conflicts, which have already claimed tens of thousands of lives.History is clear and the indiscriminate effects of these weapons cannot be glossed over. Even when initially placed on frontlines, they inevitably kill and maim the very people they were meant to protect before they are eventually cleared at astronomical costs.The Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention comprehensively prohibits anti-personnel mines and provides vital protections for civilians in both armed conflict and post-conflict situations. States withdrawing from such treatiesrisk eroding life-saving protectionsandthreaten decades of global efforts to eradicate these inhumane weapons. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. To adopt these rules in times of peace and to abandon them in times of war or increased tensions is to misunderstand their meaning entirely. To abandon them because the adversary does not respect them leads to a dangerous downward spiral, of which civilians will pay the price.Their limited military utility has not changed since the Convention was adopted in 1997: whatever it may be, states agreed to ban these weapons, because some weapons are simply not acceptable.Honouring humanitarian commitments is vital for protecting people caught up in armed conflict and serves the interest of all, regardless of the actions of others. Now is the time to uphold – not weaken – humanitarian norms.In times of great uncertainty and acute international tensions,we call on states to reinforce the stigma againstweapons whose human cost is unacceptable. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. \nGeneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the dedication of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been affected yet continue to respond.Since the beginning of the conflict, the IFRC network has lost 14 members. Eleven PRCS staff and volunteers have been killed, and three from Israel’s Magen David Adom.

They were killed when the ambulance was hit on the 10th of January 2024.\r\n\r\nYoussef Abu Muammar was the ambulance’s driver. Fadi Fouad Al-Maani was a paramedic. Islam Abu Riyala was a first responder, while Fouad Abu Khamash was a volunteer. All were killed while on duty, in a vehicle clearly marked with the protective Red Crescent emblem. \r\n\r\nThese deaths are shocking and completely unacceptable. Under International Humanitarian Law, ambulances, healthcare workers and their patients must be respected and protected. Tragically Youssef, Islam, Fadi and Fouad bring to eight the number of PRCS staff and volunteers killed on duty in Gaza since October.\r\n\r\nWe send our deepest condolences to the families of those killed and all those in the Palestine Red Crescent Society.

These strikes have led to the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day old infant, and displaced thousands who were taking shelter at the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne of our colleagues, a volunteer from the PRCS emergency medical services was injured in the strike, which is in addition to the 26 who have been injured since the beginning of the escalation of hostilities and the four colleagues who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the north of Gaza health services were largely destroyed, the health care system in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of collapse. Most hospitals in the north, including PRCS's Al-Quds hospital, have ceased operations due to fuel shortages, lack of medicines, medical equipment, and safe access. Al-Amal Hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south, is duly marked by the Red Crescent emblem.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems, symbolize neutral and independent humanitarian assistance at all times, and guarantee protection in times of conflict and disaster around the world. Continuous shelling, coupled with a dire shortage of fuel and supplies, has pushed the health facility to its limits.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. We commend the bravery of PRCS volunteers and paramedics, many of whom have lost family members or been detained, yet continue to respond selflessly.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers, and facilities. We call for rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers.\r\n\r\nIn any conflict or crisis, access to health care is a question of life or death. People in Gaza have suffered enough, and healthcare is one of the last remaining beacons of hope.\r\n\r\nIt’s a humanitarian and moral imperative to ensure the people of Gaza can access health care during this period of intense conflict.\r\n\r\nMore information, contact [email protected]\r\n\r\nIn Beirut:\r\n\r\nMey Alsayegh: +961 3 229 352\r\n\r\nIn Geneva:\r\n\r\nTommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67 \r\nMrinalini Santhanam: +41 76 381 50 06\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 06/12/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nStatement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nThe human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity.\r\n\r\nA month since we last met, we face a collective moral failure to forge political and peaceful solutions to end this conflict, release all hostages, protect civilians and civilian infrastructures.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. \r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.\r\n\r\nThey are operating under constant severe restrictions and life-threatening danger.\r\n\r\nAs we sadly know, the Palestine Red Crescent Society just lost another volunteer this week and a staff member was injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with ECHO, we have delivered 890 tons of supplies through our humanitarian air bridge for Gaza. \r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal--no amount of humanitarian assistance or funding alone will stop the destruction of Gaza and its people without protection and a political solution.\r\n\r\nIn this darkest hour, we call on you to turn these urgent asks into powerful actions:\r\n\r\nDe-escalation - Prioritize concrete solutions to stop the bloodshed and establish lasting peace. This will allow scaling up of aid efforts so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\nProtection- Ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action with full respect of international humanitarian law. \r\n\r\nProtect civilians and healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nAccess - Grant unhindered and safe access to reach all parts of Gaza.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 09/11/2023\n\n       | Speech\n\nStatement by the IFRC Secretary General at France’s International Humanitarian Conference on the Civilian Population in Gaza\nExcellencies,\r\n\r\nNo words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict, civilians, particularly children and women and healthcare workers pay the heaviest burden, some losing their lives, casting a lasting moral shadow upon us all for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis suffering must end. Now.\r\n\r\nIsrael has suffered heartbreaking human loss, including the taking of hostages which must end now.\r\n\r\nMagen David Adom in Israel is providing vital assistance, ambulance and health services.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. They do so fearlessly with unseen dedication in extremely dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nThe ICRC is playing a critical role, and we are coordinating closely as a Movement.\r\n\r\nToday I am here with Dr Younis Alkhatib, President of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. PRCS is the leading Emergency Medical Service provider and is central to the receipt, delivery and coordination of aid in Gaza. However, they operate under constant threat to their lives, lack of access and inadequate relief and medical supplies.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.\r\n\r\nWe see this in the work of the Egyptian Red Crescent as well as in the preparatory work of National Societies in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and more.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC is supporting and coordinating these national efforts while working hard to augment their capacities as well as partnering with ECHO for a humanitarian air bridge for Gaza.\r\n\r\nToday we call for three things and ask for your influence to–\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProtection to ensure neutral, independent humanitarian action of our member National Societies at local level as per IHL.\r\n\tAccess to ensure unhindered and safe access for National Societies to reach all parts of Gaza including the north.\r\n\tAssistance to scale up aid efforts unconditionally so that hospitals, ambulances, water facilities, and waste management can function.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how dark the hour, we must support one another and be a collective beacon of hope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/11/2023\n\n       | Article\n\nThe IFRC calls for safe and unhindered access across the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages \nA month since the onsetof violence across Israel and Palestine, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages seized during the conflict. It also calls upon the diplomatic community to accelerate efforts towards a longer-term peace agreement and a massive scaling up of humanitarian assistance, including fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, both members of the IFRC network, have been responding since the beginning of the hostilities. Staff and volunteers of both National Societies have been at the forefront of humanitarian efforts. And they have seen the violence firsthand. Many have lost friends and family members. Seven members, three of MDA and four of PRCS, have lost their own lives while helping others; many more have been injured.\r\n\r\nThe IFRC repeats its calls for all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and immediately cease indiscriminate attacks. That means the protection of civilians, healthcare workers and facilities,humanitarian first responders, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, rapid and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid, including fuel, throughout the entire Gaza Strip and safe and unhindered access for humanitarian workers. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers, hospitals and ambulances are not targets and must be protected. It is not possible to evacuate patients and those who care for themfromhospitals; we ask for an end to demands to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe last month has been the most devastating period of violence ever across Israel and Palestine, killing around twelve thousand people and gravely injuring many more, mostly women and children. The siege of Gaza has caused immense suffering to more than two million people. Both the violence and the siege need to end.\r\n\r\nWe call on all parties forsafe and unhindered access across the Gaza Stripand the release of hostages.

This must never happen again’ \nThe following op-ed article by IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain was first published by the UK Guardian on 5 April, 2025.Which was most horrific? The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions.

The agonising week-long wait – silence after our colleagues went missing, as we suspected the worst but hoped for something different? Or the confirmation, seven days later, that bodies had been found? Or, since, the ghastly details of how they were found, and killed?Their ambulances were crushed and partly buried. Nearby were their bodies – also buried, en masse, in the sand. Our dead colleagues were still wearing their Red Crescent vests. In life, those uniforms signalled their status as humanitarian workers; they should have protected them. Instead, in death, those red vests became their shrouds.Ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were good people. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. But these men were not cavalier. They believed their Red Crescent-marked vehicles would make it clear who was inside and their purpose. They believed international humanitarian law meant something; that healthcare workers would be protected. They assumed that meant they would not be a target. But they were wrong. Tragically, horrifically wrong.So I’m writing with a plea. Make that assumption right again. Those deaths in Gaza – while especially awful – were part of a growing trend. More and more humanitarian aid workers are being killed around the world. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Helping people prepare for crisis and then dealing with it when it hits is what our people do. Right now, thousands of colleagues from the Myanmar Red Cross are helping people with their immediate post-earthquake needs. In Russia and Ukraine our members are helping people affected on both sides of the conflict.Our teams can help people deal with trauma. But they should not be subjected to it because of what they do. International humanitarian law requires that. Health and humanitarian aid workers must be protected. They wear emblems for a reason. Yet according to the Aid Worker Security Database, they are being killed in growing numbers. In 2023, that number was 280.Our network lost 18 that year on duty – including six from our national society in Israel, Magen David Adom, on that awful day in October. Last year, a record 382 humanitarians are known to have been killed. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. A further eight were killed while working in Sudan. This year is looking even worse.We cannot allow these deaths – any of these attacks – to become normalised. We must reject any narrative that they are inevitable, or part of the risk of the job. I’m grateful for the political, media and online outrage over the deaths of our workers last month. I share it. But we must all go further.First, we must see the same when any humanitarian is killed, wherever and whenever. Too often when a worker is local to the community they serve, there is far less attention than when an “international” worker dies.Second, we must demand that governments change their behaviour and that of those who answer to them. Whatever the circumstances, states have a legal responsibility to protect all civilians, including humanitarian workers. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. Neutrality and impartiality are at our core – constitutional, fundamental principles of our organisation. Straying from them could impede our work. Our job is to manage consequences, not point fingers at causes. Even in circumstances as horrific as those of last month, or 18 months ago in Israel, neither I nor my organisation assign blame towards people, groups, institutions or governments. You’ll notice I don’t in this article, even as others on this website and elsewhere do exactly that.Why? Because we believe in sticking to our principles just as we demand others stick to laws, especially international humanitarian law. We hope our commitments to neutrality and impartiality mean our voice carries even more weight when we demand justice.And demand justice we do. In Gaza, independent investigators must be allowed access and given full details of what happened two Sundays ago, however uncomfortable for those who have them. There must be respect for those who died through consequences for those who killed them. Impunity in any place breeds impunity in every place. That can never stand.Last week the IFRC’s president and I sent letters of condolence to the families of three of our network’s members in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Syria. We mourned their loss and, through an EU-supported Red Family Fund that we wish we didn’t need, offered token financial contributions. Similar letters will be sent soon to grieving families in Gaza.But letters of condolence, of course, are far too little, far too late. What will make a difference is if the tide of disrespect for international humanitarian law is turned.I am outraged. But I’m also tired of being outraged. Humanitarian aid workers must be protected. For the sake, quite simply, of humanity.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\n30/03/2025\n\n       | Press release\n\nIFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza \nGeneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. After seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen, the bodies of ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed Al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed Al Sharif and Rifatt Radwan were retrieved today (30 March). Ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra is still missing.IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said: “I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians. They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not.”“Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.“Our network is in mourning, but this is not enough. Instead of another call on all parties to protect and respect humanitarians and civilians, I pose a question: ‘When will this stop? All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30.

They are ordinary people, bolstered by their compulsion to help others, and equipped with the training and experience on how to respond during emergencies.These volunteers are not without fear, however. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. “Because I know it can spread from person to person. But it’s okay to be scared. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. \"People know we will be there for them if they need us during any disaster,\" he says.For Hamasseo Borotia of the Cameroon Red Cross it’s about helping people in local communities avoid the dangers of deadly infectious diseases such as cholera. \"I'm happy to help protect my community from contagious diseases,”says Hamasseo. “Seeing that the information I pass on is put into practice and that the community is better off fills me with pride.”Others face daily, life-treatening dangers while working in active combat zones. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. On that locker door, he has posted a photo of his close friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani, killed earlier this year while on duty.“Every time I open the closet, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, recalling other colleagues lost while on duty. “We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”Mohammed Alburai also understands that loss. And like Mansour, his passion to help his fellow human beings continues unabated. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. Even one life lost is far too many. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. This solidarity is critical because, as Mohammed Alburai knows well, volunteers will continue to work on behalf of humanity despite the dangers. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. “We are neutral and we support all humans. But we need this to change.

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 07/04/2025\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'.

We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says.

But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.\"The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 19/08/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nWorld Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity\nIt’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 02/02/2024\n\n       | Article\n\nIFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.\"The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day.

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.
