Poverty, poor nutrition and insufficient access to clean water and sanitation are all harmful factors, as is insufficient access to quality health services such as essential care for newborns. Health promotion, disease prevention services (such as vaccinations) and treatment of common childhood illnesses are essential if children are to thrive as well as survive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                        Impact\r\n                    \n\n\n\n\nNewborn deaths account for 47% of deaths among children under the age of 5 globally, resulting in 2.4 million lives lost each year. About one third of newborn deaths occur on the day of birth and close to three quarters occur within the first week of life. In addition, almost 2 million babies born with no signs of life at 28 weeks of pregnancy or more (stillbirths) and 295 000 maternal deaths occur each year.Children who die within the first 28 days of birth suffer from conditions and diseases associated with lack of quality care at birth or skilled care and treatment immediately after birth and in the first days of life. The vast majority of newborn deaths take place in low and middle-income countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                        WHO response\r\n                    \n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, 194 Member States of the Sixty-seventh World Health Assembly endorsed the action plan (Resolution WHA67.10). Led by UNICEF and the World Health Organization, Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) was guided by the advice of experts and partners and by multistakeholder consultations and a web-based consultation with over 300 comments from stakeholders. The WHO Director-General has been requested to monitor progress towards the achievement of the global goal and targets, reporting periodically to the World Health Assembly until 2030.Twenty-eight focus countries were targeted for data collection through the use of a progress tracking tool. This systematic tracking of progress enables the assessment of the status of implementation of ENAP strategies, maps technical assistance needs and identifies barriers to implementation in line with the ENAP milestones and recommendations.Another area of work is the Quality of Care Network. The main objective of the network is broadening the focus from access to care to include quality of care for maternal, newborn and child health to cut preventable maternal and newborn illness and deaths, and to improve every mother’s experience of care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFact sheets Newborns: improving survival and well-beingInfant and young child feedingCongenital disordersQuestions and answers HIV and infant feedingWhat is a preterm baby?What health challenges do preterm babies face?What kind of care do preterm babies need?Databases and tools Maternal and newborn dataResolutions and decisions Newborn health: draft action plan: Every newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths: Report by the Secretariat | Resolution WHA67.21Corrigendum | Resolution WHA67.21 Corr.1Technical work Newborn Health UnitMaternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health, and AgingSexual and Reproductive Health and Research\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNews\nAll →\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 April 2025\n\nDepartmental update\n\n\nMembership of the Expert Group on the Prevention, Diagnosis and Management of Maternal Anaemia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 February 2025\n\nDepartmental update\n\n\nWorld Health Day 2025 to spotlight women and babies’ survival, urging solidarity at a critical moment for global health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 November 2024\n\nDepartmental update\n\n\nComprehensive hospital data provides new insights into maternal and newborn health in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 October 2024\n\nDepartmental update\n\n\nWHO urges expansion of lifesaving midwifery care for women and babies\n\n\n\n\n\nOur work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaising the importance of postnatal care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromoting baby-friendly hospitals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing critical knowledge gaps in newborn health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrengthening home-based records implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying common areas of progress with the Every Newborn Action Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on postnatal care in low- and middle-income countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch in maternal, perinatal, and adolescent health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest publications\nAll →\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 March 2025\n\n\nWHO recommendations on maternal health: guidelines approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee, 2nd... \n\n\n\nThis document provides a summary of all WHO recommendations on maternal health based on guidelines approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee.

    "description": "To ensure every child survives and thrives to reach their full potential, we must focus on improving care around the time of birth and the first week of life. The high rates of preventable death and poor health and well-being of newborns and children under the age of five are indicators of the uneven coverage of life-saving interventions and, more broadly, of inadequate social and economic development. Poverty, poor nutrition and insufficient access to clean water and sanitation are all harmful factors, as is insufficient access to quality health services such as essential care for newborns. ",
