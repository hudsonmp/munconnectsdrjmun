Exceptional rainfall triggered unprecedented flooding, and we saw the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record.”Depending on the dataset used, it was the warmest year on record in Central America and the Caribbean, and the warmest or second warmest in Mexico and South America.Venezuela became the second country in the world to lose all its glaciers with the disappearance of Humboldt, its last.Floods triggered by heavy rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul became Brazil’s worst climate-related disaster, causing huge economic losses to agriculture and claiming nearly 200 lives.Wildfires in the Amazon and Pantanal regions, central Chile, Mexico and Belize were fuelled by drought and extreme heatwaves; in Chile the wildfires resulted in at least 130 deaths, making them the country’s worst disaster since the 2010 earthquake.Rising sea-levels rendered coastal communities and Caribbean island nations more vulnerable to hurricanes: Beryl was the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall on Grenada and its dependencies and caused devastation across the Caribbean.Nearly 70 per cent of the region’s energy mix came from renewable sources, however, with solar and wind seeing “a remarkable 30 per cent increase in capacity and generation compared to 2023,” according to the WMO, an IFRC partner agency.“There is also hope.
