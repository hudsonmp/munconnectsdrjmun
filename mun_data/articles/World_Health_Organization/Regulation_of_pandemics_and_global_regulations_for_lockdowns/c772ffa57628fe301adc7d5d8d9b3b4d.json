Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention. Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person). In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year.  Sami Moussa Abu Mustafa, ambulance volunteer with the Palestine Red Crescent, provided a testimony, along with volunteers from other affected National Societies: \n\n\n“I feel deep sorrow over the losses we have witnessed this year, including the loss of colleagues. Everyone standing in solidarity with us strengthens our resilience, supports our efforts, and ensures the continuity of the services we provide to communities. What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.” At a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregated to highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRC Under Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy, Nena Stoiljkovic, and a Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual. AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).  For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] In Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367                    Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              IFRC Categories\n            \n\n              Country\n            \n\n              National Societies\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Related\nProtection\nVolunteering development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestine\nSwitzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Red Cross\nHellenic Red Cross\nItalian Red Cross\nNigerian Red Cross Society\nPakistan Red Crescent\nSingapore Red Cross Society\nSlovenian Red Cross\nSyrian Arab Red Crescent\nThe Netherlands Red Cross\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society\nVenezuelan Red Cross\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated press releases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n 02/12/2021\n\n\n        Afghanistan: Worst drought and hunger crisis in decades \n      \n\n\n\n\n        Afghanistan: Worst drought and hunger crisis in decades \n      \n 02/12/2021\n\n       | Press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n 19/07/2021\n\n\n        IFRC launches emergency appeal to join SOS MEDITERRANEE’s life-saving mission as deaths soar in the Mediterranean Sea\n      \n\n\n\n\n        IFRC launches emergency appeal to join SOS MEDITERRANEE’s life-saving mission as deaths soar in the Mediterranean Sea\n      \n 19/07/2021\n\n       | Press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n 05/03/2021\n\n\n        Myanmar: Red Cross urges protection for first aiders amid recent violence\n      \n\n\n\n\n        Myanmar: Red Cross urges protection for first aiders amid recent violence\n      \n 05/03/2021\n\n       | Press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress release\n\n 31/07/2020\n\n\n        International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement urges all nations to end the nuclear era\n      \n\n\n\n\n        International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement urges all nations to end the nuclear era\n      \n 31/07/2020\n\n       | Press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      View more press releases\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n          Share on X\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Share on Facebook\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Share on Linkedin\n\n‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year \n\n\n\n 05/12/2024\n\n       | Press release\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the lead up to International Volunteers Day, IFRC staff and Geneva Red Cross volunteers gathered in a moment of silence to pay tribute to IFRC network volunteers and staff who have died or been killed this year in the line of duty.\nPhoto:\n        IFRC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop.

What motivates us to persevere is our sense of humanitarian duty, our desire to alleviate the suffering of others, and our commitment to saving lives despite the sacrifices involved.”\n\nAt a special event held at IFRC Geneva headquarters on 4 December, IFRC staff and volunteers congregated to highlight the importance of ‘Protecting Humanity’. IFRC Under Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy, Nena Stoiljkovic, and a Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.\n\nAV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).\n\nAV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly

    "description": "Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. Even one life lost is far too many. Yet since the beginning of the year, 32 of our volunteers and staff have died or been killed while performing their humanitarian duties – 29 in violent attacks and 3 in accidents. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.",
