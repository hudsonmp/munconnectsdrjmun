We acknowledge that there has been an increase in fraudulent activities on social network sites and we strongly advise against responding to requests for financial assistance. \nPreventative measures, such as routine online and media monitoring, are being conducted by our teams to protect supporters like you from running into any fraudulent situations.  \nIf you would like more information about our reported scams, please visit our Online Scams page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I earmark my donation for a certain area/project?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes, you can earmark your donation toward a specific program or country that we are working in; however, we ask that you consider contributing unrestricted funds so we can allocate our resources more efficiently where needs are the greatest. Our ability to provide rapid and targeted medical care to emergencies would not have been possible without the ongoing general support from our donors.\nIf you wish to restrict your donation, please send an email to donations@newyork.msf.org stating which country or program you would like the funds directed. In your email, please include your name, full address, and the amount of your donation to ensure your gift is redirected for your desired operation.\nUnrestricted donations enable MSF to carry out our programs around the world. While we try to honor requests to earmark, should we receive more gifts than we can use for a program, we will reallocate them where the needs are greatest.\nWe thank you for your continued support to MSF and our operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial accountability\n\n\nIs Doctors Without Borders a nonprofit organization/NGO?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes, Doctors Without Borders USA, Inc. is recognized as an international nonprofit organization/NGO under the Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3).\nOur Federal Tax ID number or Employer Identification Number (EIN) is 13-3433452.\nFor more information, please visit our Financial Information page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre donations to Doctors Without Borders tax-deductible?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes, 100% of your donation is tax deductible as Doctors Without Borders USA, Inc. is recognized as tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. \nOur Federal Tax ID number, or Employer Identification Number (EIN), is 13-3433452.  \nFor more information, please visit our Financial Information page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much money does Doctors Without Borders raise? How does Doctors Without Borders get funding?\n\n\n\n \n\nIn 2023, Doctors Without Borders revenue was over $745.3 million—raised through private contributors, such as individuals, foundations, and corporations. \nIn the interests of maintaining our independence and neutrality, Doctors Without Borders has not received or solicited funding from the US government since 2002. Internationally, we limit government funding to less than 20 percent of total funds raised. We strive to keep this figure as low as possible and currently it is at 2%. \nWe have also established a corporate gift acceptance policy to alleviate the potential conflict between corporations or industries whose core activities may be in direct conflict with—or jeopardize—the goals of our medical humanitarian work, or in any way limit our ability to provide humanitarian assistance.  \nThese businesses include those that derive income from the production or sale of the following: \n\nTobacco \nAlcohol \nArms \nPharmaceuticals (medicines, medical equipment, diagnostic and biotechnical materials, and research) \nExtractive industries (mineral, oil, or gas) \n\nFor more information, please visit our Financial Reports page, or email Donor Services at donations@newyork.msf.org and we can further assist you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of my donation goes to program activities?\n\n\n\n \n\n85 cents of every dollar support our programs.  \nSince 1995, Doctors Without Borders has maintained allocating more than 85 percent of its expenditure to its program activities. We strive to minimize fundraising and administrative costs, in which just 14 percent is spent on fundraising costs, and 1 percent on management.   \nFor more specific information about how we spend our donor funds, please visit our Financial Information page and see our annual reports. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther ways to donate\n\n\nCan I donate supplies to Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nWe are grateful that you have considered Doctors Without Borders for your donation of medical equipment, drugs, food, or other materials for our operations, however, we are unable to accept these donations.  \nAfter decades of experience, we’ve determined the best way to respond within moments’ notice is to have prepared, specialized, and uniform kits that are ready to go in the event of an emergency. These standardized emergency kits can get into the hands of our teams much more efficiently than if we had to manage the sorting, packing, and allocation of many different types of supplies. \nWe recommend that you contact your local charitable organizations, which are often better equipped to distribute items to those in need within your community, or by visiting guidestar.org to find a suitable organization that accepts gifts in-kind. \nWe thank you again for your support and consideration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I donate in a currency other than US dollars?\n\n\n\n \n\nWhile Doctors Without Borders USA can only accept gifts in US dollars, we do have several offices around the world to give in your local currency.  \nPlease refer to our Offices Around the World page for further direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I hold a fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes!

Our ability to provide rapid and targeted medical care to emergencies would not have been possible without the ongoing general support from our donors.\nIf you wish to restrict your donation, please send an email to donations@newyork.msf.org stating which country or program you would like the funds directed. In your email, please include your name, full address, and the amount of your donation to ensure your gift is redirected for your desired operation.\nUnrestricted donations enable MSF to carry out our programs around the world.

How does Doctors Without Borders get funding?\n\n\n\n \n\nIn 2023, Doctors Without Borders revenue was over $745.3 million—raised through private contributors, such as individuals, foundations, and corporations. \nIn the interests of maintaining our independence and neutrality, Doctors Without Borders has not received or solicited funding from the US government since 2002. Internationally, we limit government funding to less than 20 percent of total funds raised. We strive to keep this figure as low as possible and currently it is at 2%. \nWe have also established a corporate gift acceptance policy to alleviate the potential conflict between corporations or industries whose core activities may be in direct conflict with—or jeopardize—the goals of our medical humanitarian work, or in any way limit our ability to provide humanitarian assistance.  \nThese businesses include those that derive income from the production or sale of the following: \n\nTobacco \nAlcohol \nArms \nPharmaceuticals (medicines, medical equipment, diagnostic and biotechnical materials, and research) \nExtractive industries (mineral, oil, or gas) \n\nFor more information, please visit our Financial Reports page, or email Donor Services at donations@newyork.msf.org and we can further assist you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of my donation goes to program activities?\n\n\n\n \n\n85 cents of every dollar support our programs.  \nSince 1995, Doctors Without Borders has maintained allocating more than 85 percent of its expenditure to its program activities. We strive to minimize fundraising and administrative costs, in which just 14 percent is spent on fundraising costs, and 1 percent on management.   \nFor more specific information about how we spend our donor funds, please visit our Financial Information page and see our annual reports. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther ways to donate\n\n\nCan I donate supplies to Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nWe are grateful that you have considered Doctors Without Borders for your donation of medical equipment, drugs, food, or other materials for our operations, however, we are unable to accept these donations.  \nAfter decades of experience, we’ve determined the best way to respond within moments’ notice is to have prepared, specialized, and uniform kits that are ready to go in the event of an emergency. These standardized emergency kits can get into the hands of our teams much more efficiently than if we had to manage the sorting, packing, and allocation of many different types of supplies. \nWe recommend that you contact your local charitable organizations, which are often better equipped to distribute items to those in need within your community, or by visiting guidestar.org to find a suitable organization that accepts gifts in-kind. \nWe thank you again for your support and consideration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I donate in a currency other than US dollars?\n\n\n\n \n\nWhile Doctors Without Borders USA can only accept gifts in US dollars, we do have several offices around the world to give in your local currency.  \nPlease refer to our Offices Around the World page for further direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I hold a fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes!

How does Doctors Without Borders get funding?\n\n\n\n \n\nIn 2023, Doctors Without Borders revenue was over $745.3 million—raised through private contributors, such as individuals, foundations, and corporations. \nIn the interests of maintaining our independence and neutrality, Doctors Without Borders has not received or solicited funding from the US government since 2002. Internationally, we limit government funding to less than 20 percent of total funds raised. We strive to keep this figure as low as possible and currently it is at 2%. \nWe have also established a corporate gift acceptance policy to alleviate the potential conflict between corporations or industries whose core activities may be in direct conflict with—or jeopardize—the goals of our medical humanitarian work, or in any way limit our ability to provide humanitarian assistance.  \nThese businesses include those that derive income from the production or sale of the following: \n\nTobacco \nAlcohol \nArms \nPharmaceuticals (medicines, medical equipment, diagnostic and biotechnical materials, and research) \nExtractive industries (mineral, oil, or gas) \n\nFor more information, please visit our Financial Reports page, or email Donor Services at donations@newyork.msf.org and we can further assist you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of my donation goes to program activities?\n\n\n\n \n\n85 cents of every dollar support our programs.  \nSince 1995, Doctors Without Borders has maintained allocating more than 85 percent of its expenditure to its program activities. We strive to minimize fundraising and administrative costs, in which just 14 percent is spent on fundraising costs, and 1 percent on management.   \nFor more specific information about how we spend our donor funds, please visit our Financial Information page and see our annual reports. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther ways to donate\n\n\nCan I donate supplies to Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nWe are grateful that you have considered Doctors Without Borders for your donation of medical equipment, drugs, food, or other materials for our operations, however, we are unable to accept these donations.  \nAfter decades of experience, we’ve determined the best way to respond within moments’ notice is to have prepared, specialized, and uniform kits that are ready to go in the event of an emergency. These standardized emergency kits can get into the hands of our teams much more efficiently than if we had to manage the sorting, packing, and allocation of many different types of supplies. \nWe recommend that you contact your local charitable organizations, which are often better equipped to distribute items to those in need within your community, or by visiting guidestar.org to find a suitable organization that accepts gifts in-kind. \nWe thank you again for your support and consideration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I donate in a currency other than US dollars?\n\n\n\n \n\nWhile Doctors Without Borders USA can only accept gifts in US dollars, we do have several offices around the world to give in your local currency.  \nPlease refer to our Offices Around the World page for further direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I hold a fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes!

Internationally, we limit government funding to less than 20 percent of total funds raised. We strive to keep this figure as low as possible and currently it is at 2%. \nWe have also established a corporate gift acceptance policy to alleviate the potential conflict between corporations or industries whose core activities may be in direct conflict with—or jeopardize—the goals of our medical humanitarian work, or in any way limit our ability to provide humanitarian assistance.  \nThese businesses include those that derive income from the production or sale of the following: \n\nTobacco \nAlcohol \nArms \nPharmaceuticals (medicines, medical equipment, diagnostic and biotechnical materials, and research) \nExtractive industries (mineral, oil, or gas) \n\nFor more information, please visit our Financial Reports page, or email Donor Services at donations@newyork.msf.org and we can further assist you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of my donation goes to program activities?\n\n\n\n \n\n85 cents of every dollar support our programs.  \nSince 1995, Doctors Without Borders has maintained allocating more than 85 percent of its expenditure to its program activities.

These standardized emergency kits can get into the hands of our teams much more efficiently than if we had to manage the sorting, packing, and allocation of many different types of supplies. \nWe recommend that you contact your local charitable organizations, which are often better equipped to distribute items to those in need within your community, or by visiting guidestar.org to find a suitable organization that accepts gifts in-kind. \nWe thank you again for your support and consideration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I donate in a currency other than US dollars?\n\n\n\n \n\nWhile Doctors Without Borders USA can only accept gifts in US dollars, we do have several offices around the world to give in your local currency.  \nPlease refer to our Offices Around the World page for further direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I hold a fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes!

Our ability to provide rapid and targeted medical care to emergencies would not have been possible without the ongoing general support from our donors.\nIf you wish to restrict your donation, please send an email to donations@newyork.msf.org stating which country or program you would like the funds directed. In your email, please include your name, full address, and the amount of your donation to ensure your gift is redirected for your desired operation.\nUnrestricted donations enable MSF to carry out our programs around the world.

How does Doctors Without Borders get funding?\n\n\n\n \n\nIn 2023, Doctors Without Borders revenue was over $745.3 million—raised through private contributors, such as individuals, foundations, and corporations. \nIn the interests of maintaining our independence and neutrality, Doctors Without Borders has not received or solicited funding from the US government since 2002. Internationally, we limit government funding to less than 20 percent of total funds raised. We strive to keep this figure as low as possible and currently it is at 2%. \nWe have also established a corporate gift acceptance policy to alleviate the potential conflict between corporations or industries whose core activities may be in direct conflict with—or jeopardize—the goals of our medical humanitarian work, or in any way limit our ability to provide humanitarian assistance.  \nThese businesses include those that derive income from the production or sale of the following: \n\nTobacco \nAlcohol \nArms \nPharmaceuticals (medicines, medical equipment, diagnostic and biotechnical materials, and research) \nExtractive industries (mineral, oil, or gas) \n\nFor more information, please visit our Financial Reports page, or email Donor Services at donations@newyork.msf.org and we can further assist you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of my donation goes to program activities?\n\n\n\n \n\n85 cents of every dollar support our programs.  \nSince 1995, Doctors Without Borders has maintained allocating more than 85 percent of its expenditure to its program activities. We strive to minimize fundraising and administrative costs, in which just 14 percent is spent on fundraising costs, and 1 percent on management.   \nFor more specific information about how we spend our donor funds, please visit our Financial Information page and see our annual reports. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther ways to donate\n\n\nCan I donate supplies to Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nWe are grateful that you have considered Doctors Without Borders for your donation of medical equipment, drugs, food, or other materials for our operations, however, we are unable to accept these donations.  \nAfter decades of experience, we’ve determined the best way to respond within moments’ notice is to have prepared, specialized, and uniform kits that are ready to go in the event of an emergency. These standardized emergency kits can get into the hands of our teams much more efficiently than if we had to manage the sorting, packing, and allocation of many different types of supplies. \nWe recommend that you contact your local charitable organizations, which are often better equipped to distribute items to those in need within your community, or by visiting guidestar.org to find a suitable organization that accepts gifts in-kind. \nWe thank you again for your support and consideration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I donate in a currency other than US dollars?\n\n\n\n \n\nWhile Doctors Without Borders USA can only accept gifts in US dollars, we do have several offices around the world to give in your local currency.  \nPlease refer to our Offices Around the World page for further direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I hold a fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes!

How does Doctors Without Borders get funding?\n\n\n\n \n\nIn 2023, Doctors Without Borders revenue was over $745.3 million—raised through private contributors, such as individuals, foundations, and corporations. \nIn the interests of maintaining our independence and neutrality, Doctors Without Borders has not received or solicited funding from the US government since 2002. Internationally, we limit government funding to less than 20 percent of total funds raised. We strive to keep this figure as low as possible and currently it is at 2%. \nWe have also established a corporate gift acceptance policy to alleviate the potential conflict between corporations or industries whose core activities may be in direct conflict with—or jeopardize—the goals of our medical humanitarian work, or in any way limit our ability to provide humanitarian assistance.  \nThese businesses include those that derive income from the production or sale of the following: \n\nTobacco \nAlcohol \nArms \nPharmaceuticals (medicines, medical equipment, diagnostic and biotechnical materials, and research) \nExtractive industries (mineral, oil, or gas) \n\nFor more information, please visit our Financial Reports page, or email Donor Services at donations@newyork.msf.org and we can further assist you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percentage of my donation goes to program activities?\n\n\n\n \n\n85 cents of every dollar support our programs.  \nSince 1995, Doctors Without Borders has maintained allocating more than 85 percent of its expenditure to its program activities. We strive to minimize fundraising and administrative costs, in which just 14 percent is spent on fundraising costs, and 1 percent on management.   \nFor more specific information about how we spend our donor funds, please visit our Financial Information page and see our annual reports. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther ways to donate\n\n\nCan I donate supplies to Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nWe are grateful that you have considered Doctors Without Borders for your donation of medical equipment, drugs, food, or other materials for our operations, however, we are unable to accept these donations.  \nAfter decades of experience, we’ve determined the best way to respond within moments’ notice is to have prepared, specialized, and uniform kits that are ready to go in the event of an emergency. These standardized emergency kits can get into the hands of our teams much more efficiently than if we had to manage the sorting, packing, and allocation of many different types of supplies. \nWe recommend that you contact your local charitable organizations, which are often better equipped to distribute items to those in need within your community, or by visiting guidestar.org to find a suitable organization that accepts gifts in-kind. \nWe thank you again for your support and consideration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I donate in a currency other than US dollars?\n\n\n\n \n\nWhile Doctors Without Borders USA can only accept gifts in US dollars, we do have several offices around the world to give in your local currency.  \nPlease refer to our Offices Around the World page for further direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I hold a fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes!

We strive to minimize fundraising and administrative costs, in which just 14 percent is spent on fundraising costs, and 1 percent on management.   \nFor more specific information about how we spend our donor funds, please visit our Financial Information page and see our annual reports. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther ways to donate\n\n\nCan I donate supplies to Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nWe are grateful that you have considered Doctors Without Borders for your donation of medical equipment, drugs, food, or other materials for our operations, however, we are unable to accept these donations.  \nAfter decades of experience, we’ve determined the best way to respond within moments’ notice is to have prepared, specialized, and uniform kits that are ready to go in the event of an emergency. These standardized emergency kits can get into the hands of our teams much more efficiently than if we had to manage the sorting, packing, and allocation of many different types of supplies. \nWe recommend that you contact your local charitable organizations, which are often better equipped to distribute items to those in need within your community, or by visiting guidestar.org to find a suitable organization that accepts gifts in-kind. \nWe thank you again for your support and consideration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I donate in a currency other than US dollars?\n\n\n\n \n\nWhile Doctors Without Borders USA can only accept gifts in US dollars, we do have several offices around the world to give in your local currency.  \nPlease refer to our Offices Around the World page for further direction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I hold a fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders?\n\n\n\n \n\nYes!
