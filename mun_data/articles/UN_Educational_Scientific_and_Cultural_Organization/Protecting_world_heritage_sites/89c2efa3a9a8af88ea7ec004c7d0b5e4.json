We are honoured to take on the important task of contributing to the ICOMOS Triennial Scientific Plan 2024-2027, with the first year focusing on preparing for possible disasters, through the prevention and mitigation of hazards, improving resilience, as well as by preparing for conflicts that threaten our heritage resources. We also have the honour of inviting all participants to the 60th anniversary celebrations of ICOMOS. This would also be an opportunity to visit the archaeological sites in and around Lumbini and the enchanting urban ensemble of Kathmandu Valley that have gone through a decade of recovery after the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake.

The ICOMOS AGA2025 logo focuses on the stone pillar that was set up by Emperor Asoka during his pilgrimage to Lumbini in 249 BCE. The pillar is made of polished Chunar sandstone, and as per the late senior archaeologist Tara Nanda Mishra, it weighs 37 tons and stands at a height of 30 feet and 10.5 inches (9.41m), of which 13 feet and 8.5 inches (4.18m) is buried underground. The inscription on the pillar contains five lines and 90 letters in Brahmi script and Pali language. The inscription reads as follows:King Piyadasi (Asoka), the beloved of the Gods, in the twentieth year of reign, himself made a royal visit. Sakyamuni Buddha was born here, therefore, the (birth spot) marker stone was worshipped, and a stone pillar was erected. The lord having been born here, the tax of the Lumbini village was reduced to the eighth part (only).
