Furthermore, he informed the meeting that a Special Committee for the restoration and restitution of Senegalese Collections held by Western Museums has been recently established with a three-year Action Plan.\n“The African Union has rightly addressed the pertinent issue of restitution of cultural property and heritage by organizing the Continental Experts’ Workshop on the Restitution of Cultural Property and Heritage which will draft a strong African Position on Restitution of Heritage. This decision is consistent with the dedication of the continental organization which places culture more and more at the heart of its priorities” \nAs a result, we are strongly committed and I am happy to know that ECOWAS, just like the African Union, is following with a great interest, the current developments and initiatives taken by many Western institutions in direction of the restitution of looted cultural properties.” H.E.

This is enshrined in the African Union Constructive Act, the African Union Agenda 2063, the Charter of the African Cultural Renaissance and the Revised AU Plan of Action on Cultural and Creative Industries.” said Ms. Cisse.\n\nMs. Guiomar Alonso Cano, Regional Adviser for Culture / West Africa - Sahel at UNESCO in her remarks she highlighted that the fight against illicit trafficking and the return and restitution of cultural property in the African region is of utmost importance for UNESCO. She added that illicit trafficking is a global issue for that it needs collaborative work across borders, she also encouraged Member States to ratify the 1970 Convention to ensure sustainability of the protection of African cultural property and heritage and its transmission to future generations.\n\n“We are facing an alarming scale of looting of cultural property in Africa and growing demands for its return and restitution, it is indeed essential to strengthen regional and international cooperation. For us to succeed, we must enhance the commitment and cooperation of all actors concerned - Member States, multilateral institutions, technical and operational partners, the private sector, civil society, and communities – we have to lay together the foundation for a long-term approach to address these issues.” Said Mrs. Alonso.\n\nThe Continental Experts’ Workshop was attended by representatives from AU Member States, OSIWA representatives, Museum of Black Civilizations staff, UNESCO representatives, independent cultural and heritage experts, legal experts, AUCIL representatives, ICRC representatives, ICCROM representatives and staff members from the AU Commission.\n\nThe Draft Common African Position Paper on the Restitution of Cultural Property and Heritage once finalized will be presented to the AU policy organs for endorsement and dissemination in the AU Member States.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nAfrican Union Commission (AUC) – Department of Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social (HHS)\n\nMs. Angela Martins, Head of Culture Division, E-mail: MartinsA@Africa-Union.org cc: ShuleV@Africa-Union.Org; MakkyA@Africa-Union.Org; KomouR@africa-union.org; MekbibA@Africa-Union.org\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nMs. NadegeBedoum | Information and Communication Directorate | African Union Commission | E-mail: BedoumN@africa-union.org | Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n\nEsther Azaa Tankou / Head of Information / Information and Communication Directorate / AUC, Tel: +251911361185 / E-mail: yamboue@africa-union.org / Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nWeb: au.int | Addis Ababa, Ethiopia | Follow Us:Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | YouTube\n\n41252-pr-PR_-_THE_CONTINENTAL_EXPERTS_WORKSHOP_ON_THE_RESTITUTION_OF_CULTURAL_PROPERTY_AND_HERITAGE_HOLDS_AT_THE_MUSEUM_OF_BLACK_CIVILIZATION_IN_DAKAR_SENEGAL.pdf\n\n Press Release-En\n\n41252-pr-PR_-_THE_CONTINENTAL_EXPERTS_WORKSHOP_ON_THE_RESTITUTION_OF_CULTURAL_PROPERTY_AND_HERITAGE_HOLDS_AT_THE_MUSEUM_OF_BLACK_CIVILIZATION_IN_DAKAR_SENEGAL.pdf\n\n Press Release-En\n\n41252-pr-PR_-_THE_CONTINENTAL_EXPERTS_WORKSHOP_ON_THE_RESTITUTION_OF_CULTURAL_PROPERTY_AND_HERITAGE_HOLDS_AT_THE_MUSEUM_OF_BLACK_CIVILIZATION_IN_DAKAR_SENEGAL.pdf\n\n Press Release-En\n\n41252-pr-PR_-_THE_CONTINENTAL_EXPERTS_WORKSHOP_ON_THE_RESTITUTION_OF_CULTURAL_PROPERTY_AND_HERITAGE_HOLDS_AT_THE_MUSEUM_OF_BLACK_CIVILIZATION_IN_DAKAR_SENEGAL.pdf\n\n Press Release-En\n\n41252-pr-PR_-_THE_CONTINENTAL_EXPERTS_WORKSHOP_ON_THE_RESTITUTION_OF_CULTURAL_PROPERTY_AND_HERITAGE_HOLDS_AT_THE_MUSEUM_OF_BLACK_CIVILIZATION_IN_DAKAR_SENEGAL.pdf\n\n Press Release-En\n\n41252-pr-PR_-_THE_CONTINENTAL_EXPERTS_WORKSHOP_ON_THE_RESTITUTION_OF_CULTURAL_PROPERTY_AND_HERITAGE_HOLDS_AT_THE_MUSEUM_OF_BLACK_CIVILIZATION_IN_DAKAR_SENEGAL.pdf\n\n Press Release-En\n\nPress Release-En\n\nAUCHealth, Humanitarian Affairs & Social Development (HHS)\n\nAUCHealth, Humanitarian Affairs & Social Development (HHS)\n\nAUCHealth, Humanitarian Affairs & Social Development (HHS)\n\nAUCHealth, Humanitarian Affairs & Social Development (HHS)\n\nAUC\n\nHealth, Humanitarian Affairs & Social Development (HHS)\n\nShare:\n\nShare:\n\nDepartment Resources\n\nKey DocumentsFactsheetsSpeechesAll Documents\n\n\n\n\n Documents \n 38th AU Summit Program of Events \n February 12, 2025 \n 38th AU Summit Program of Events\n  \n\n Documents \n African Union Commission Annual Procurement Plan 2025 \n January 01, 2025 \n Supply Chain Management Division Operations Support Services Directorate\n\tAddis Ababa, Ethiopia\n  \n\n Documents \n African Union Commission Annual Procurement Plan 2024 \n January 01, 2024 \n Supply Chain Management Division Operations Support Services Directorate  \n\n Documents \n Outbreak Brief #4: Cholera in African Union Member States  \n May 31, 2023 \n Outbreak Update:  As of 3 May 2023, a total of 765,222,932 COVID-19 cases and 6,921,614 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR]: 1%) have been reported globally by 232 countries and territories to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Factsheets \n Diaspora Division factsheet \n September 19, 2020 \n The African Union Commission (AUC) envisions “an integrated continent that is politically united based on the ideals of Pan Africanism an  \n\n Factsheets \n Factsheet: Mobilizing Africa’s Workforce for Development \n June 24, 2020 \n Background  \n\n Factsheets \n Factsheet: CIDO - GIZ Cooperation \n June 24, 2020 \n Highlights of the cooperation with the GIZ-project “Support to the African Union on Migration and Displacement”\n  \n\n Factsheets \n Factsheet: Interfaith Dialogue on Violent Extremism (iDove) \n June 24, 2020 \n Violent extremism is a global issue.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Statement by His Excellency João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, President of the Republic of Angola and Chairperson of the African Union, on the occasion of the Handover Ceremony  \n May 13, 2025  \n\n Official Statement: World Health Day By: H.E.

The key objectives of the workshop were to develop a strong Common African Position Paper on the Restitution of Cultural Property and Heritage and to produce a Framework for Action on the Negotiations for the Return/Restitution of Illicitly Trafficked Cultural Property from the Continent. The workshop also afforded an opportunity to reflect on restitution policies for cultural property in Africa and establish networks of African cultural experts, policy makers, dealers, auctioneers, museum curators among others, working in the area of combating illicit trafficking in cultural property and heritage. “The African Union has rightly addressed the pertinent issue of restitution of cultural property and heritage by organizing the Continental Experts’ Workshop on the Restitution of Cultural Property and Heritage which will draft a strong African Position on Restitution of Heritage.
