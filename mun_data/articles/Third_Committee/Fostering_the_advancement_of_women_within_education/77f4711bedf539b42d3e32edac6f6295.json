  "text": "The number of women and girls caught in conflict is rapidly rising. In the last year alone, the proportion of women killed in armed conflict doubled, making up 40 per cent of all civilian deaths. Today, over 600 million women and girls live in conflict-affected areas, a 50 per cent increase since 2017. \nBut while the bombs and bullets make headlines, for millions of women and girls, the trauma of war, displacement, and repression is taking a devastating toll on their mental health. Almost everyone affected by a humanitarian crisis experiences psychological distress. Around 1 in 5 people will go on to develop long term mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Yet only 2 per cent get the care they need.  \nDespite the alarming data, mental health receives just 1-2 per cent of global health financing, even though mental health and psychosocial conditions account for 20 per cent of health issues reported in emergencies. Money is not the only challenge; access to care is also a major hurdle. In high-income countries there are more than 70 mental health workers for every 100,000 people. In low-income countries, that figure drops to fewer than one.   \nAs protracted wars and crises grind on, the number of women affected keeps rising, and so does the scale of this emergency. UN Women spoke to women working in Afghanistan, Gaza, Georgia and Ukraine to understand how crisis is impacting women’s mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen in Afghanistan erased from public life and denied a future\nIn Afghanistan, the return of the Taliban has stripped women of their rights and sense of self. Alison Davidian, UN Women Country Representative in Afghanistan, warns that almost four years of countless Taliban decrees are “eviscerating” the autonomy of women and girls. \nWomen have been erased from public life. There are no women in leadership positions, and 98 per cent of women say they have limited or no influence over decisions in their communities.  \n“Three years ago, an Afghan woman could technically decide to run for president. Now, she may not even be able to decide when to go and buy groceries,” said Davidian. \nSixty-eight per cent of women describe their mental health as “bad” or “very bad”, and eight per cent say they personally know someone who has attempted suicide, according to a recent UN Women report.  \n“The situation is so severe that even talking about it makes them cry,” said Mursalina Amin, founder of Girls toward leadership. “They are trapped—no education, no movement, no self-expression. All those dreams they built in their minds, they are now nothing.” \nStigma makes this worse. “They don’t even have the language to describe what they’re going through,” Amin explained. “Every Afghan girl I’ve spoken to has mental health issues, but they can’t speak about it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Mursalina Amin, founder of the Girls toward leadership organization in Afghanistan. UN Women/Aileen Orate.\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen in Gaza trapped in trauma\nIn Gaza, relentless bombing, displacement, and deprivation have created a humanitarian catastrophe. Living under siege and the constant threat of violence, women and girls face extreme levels of fear, trauma, and exhaustion. \nAs of early 2024, over 1.9 million people—nearly 85 per cent of Gaza’s population—have been forcibly displaced. There is virtually no access to clean water, food, or electricity, healthcare systems have been decimated, and 90 per cent of the population lacks regular access to food. Sanitation systems have collapsed, and women and girls are trapped in overcrowded shelters, with no privacy, basic services, or safety. \nIn these conditions, psychological distress is widespread. UN Women data shows that 75 per cent of women feel regular depression, 62 per cent cannot sleep, and 65 per cent suffer from nightmares and anxiety. But with limited access to care, most are left to cope alone. \n“My mental and psychological health is suffering,” said a 27-year-old pregnant mother of three from Khan Younis. “Sometimes I go to the toilet just to cry and cry until I feel better.” \nWomen are not only dealing with their own trauma—they are also trying to care for their children. Of the women UN Women interviewed, 77 per cent were responsible for feeding and caring for children. \n“I have not prioritized my health because I am the primary caregiver for my children, assuming the roles of both father and mother,” the 27-year-old mother added.  \nThe mental health of women in Gaza is at breaking point. Pregnant women, mothers, and girls are especially vulnerable. The emotional load of keeping families afloat falls heavily on women. The war on women’s health in Gaza is not only physical. It is mental, emotional, and unrelenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      A woman in Gaza looks through the rubble of her devastated home in February 2025.

Among internally displaced people 23 per cent suffer from PTSD, 10 per cent report depression, and 9 per cent from anxiety. Yet, only about a third have accessed care. Many don’t recognize their symptoms or face barriers like cost, stigma, or a lack of services. \nOne study found that PTSD, depression, anxiety, and comorbid conditions contributed to disability increases of up to 16 per cent among conflict-affected women and children. \n“The mental health problem is very serious, especially among children,” said Elene Rusetskaia of the Women’s Information Center. “When they live in these areas, they hear soldiers’ voices, or noise from nearby military tents and it deeply affects them. Even after the fighting stops, there’s almost no psychological support.” \n“We saw very high numbers of women addicted to medication, especially antidepressants, in two regions of Georgia,” Elene added. “When we compared, we saw that these are exactly the areas where IDPs (internally displaced persons) and conflict-affected people live. The correlation is clear. This is a massive issue.”  \nHer organization works to bridge this gap, bringing together officials, NGOs, and health experts to find practical solutions.  \n“These women had no chance to speak to people who could help them,” she said. “Now we bring them together and real help can start.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Elene Rusetskaia, of the of the Women’s Information Center in Georgia. \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine’s women face soaring domestic violence and depression\nIn Ukraine, war has pushed women backwards on every front. Gender-based violence has surged 36 per cent since 2022, women are doing more unpaid care work—up to 56 hours per week just on childcare—and unemployment has soared. This is affecting women’s well-being with 42 per cent now at risk of depression, and 23 per cent reporting that they or someone in their household needs counselling.  \nDisplaced refugees, the majority of whom are women, face some of the worst mental health impacts. Support systems are often out of reach as they flee rural areas or the frontline. An IOM survey found that 53 per cent of internally displaced people in Ukraine suffered from depression. And those seeking help often find little available. \n“Because of the bombing, my children couldn’t sleep and we were all exhausted,” said Snejana, a mother from Odessa. “Until we reached the border, I drove with the windows open to show we had children inside. I only breathed freely once we crossed.” \nWomen from marginalized groups, including Roma women, LGBTQI+ individuals, and women with disabilities, face added layers of trauma and even fewer options for support. Traditional gender roles deepen the pressure, as women carry the emotional weight of supporting families through war, instability, and displacement.  \nIn 2024, UN Women provided protection, legal aid, and psychosocial care to more than 180,000 women and girls in Ukraine through the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Kyiv, Ukraine, women and girls spend the night taking shelter at a metro station during the first days of the war, end of February\r\n2022.

Its horrors live on in the minds of those who have endured it. For women and girls in conflict zones, mental health support is not a luxury. It is essential for recovery, dignity, and survival. \nMental health care must be a core part of every humanitarian response, from trauma counselling and community-based services to safe spaces where women and girls can begin to heal. \nHistory shows that some of the greatest progress in mental health services often comes after emergencies. All countries must invest in mental health. But in conflict settings, that responsibility becomes ever more urgent. \nThe voices of women living through war are clear. \nThey are calling for help. \nIt is time to listen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nEnding violence against women and girls\nHealth\nPeace and security\nConflict, war\nEurope and Central Asia\nGeorgia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare to Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare to Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare to LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare to E-mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr copy link\nCopy URL input box\n\n\n\nURL copy button\n\nThe number of women and girls caught in conflict is rapidly rising.

In the last year alone, the proportion of women killed in armed conflict doubled, making up 40 per cent of all civilian deaths. Today, over 600 million women and girls live in conflict-affected areas, a 50 per cent increase since 2017. \nBut while the bombs and bullets make headlines, for millions of women and girls, the trauma of war, displacement, and repression is taking a devastating toll on their mental health. Almost everyone affected by a humanitarian crisis experiences psychological distress. Around 1 in 5 people will go on to develop long term mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Yet only 2 per cent get the care they need.  \nDespite the alarming data, mental health receives just 1-2 per cent of global health financing, even though mental health and psychosocial conditions account for 20 per cent of health issues reported in emergencies. Money is not the only challenge; access to care is also a major hurdle. In high-income countries there are more than 70 mental health workers for every 100,000 people. In low-income countries, that figure drops to fewer than one.   \nAs protracted wars and crises grind on, the number of women affected keeps rising, and so does the scale of this emergency. UN Women spoke to women working in Afghanistan, Gaza, Georgia and Ukraine to understand how crisis is impacting women’s mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen in Afghanistan erased from public life and denied a future\nIn Afghanistan, the return of the Taliban has stripped women of their rights and sense of self. Alison Davidian, UN Women Country Representative in Afghanistan, warns that almost four years of countless Taliban decrees are “eviscerating” the autonomy of women and girls. \nWomen have been erased from public life. There are no women in leadership positions, and 98 per cent of women say they have limited or no influence over decisions in their communities.  \n“Three years ago, an Afghan woman could technically decide to run for president. Now, she may not even be able to decide when to go and buy groceries,” said Davidian. \nSixty-eight per cent of women describe their mental health as “bad” or “very bad”, and eight per cent say they personally know someone who has attempted suicide, according to a recent UN Women report.  \n“The situation is so severe that even talking about it makes them cry,” said Mursalina Amin, founder of Girls toward leadership. “They are trapped—no education, no movement, no self-expression. All those dreams they built in their minds, they are now nothing.” \nStigma makes this worse. “They don’t even have the language to describe what they’re going through,” Amin explained. “Every Afghan girl I’ve spoken to has mental health issues, but they can’t speak about it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Mursalina Amin, founder of the Girls toward leadership organization in Afghanistan.

Living under siege and the constant threat of violence, women and girls face extreme levels of fear, trauma, and exhaustion. \nAs of early 2024, over 1.9 million people—nearly 85 per cent of Gaza’s population—have been forcibly displaced. There is virtually no access to clean water, food, or electricity, healthcare systems have been decimated, and 90 per cent of the population lacks regular access to food. Sanitation systems have collapsed, and women and girls are trapped in overcrowded shelters, with no privacy, basic services, or safety. \nIn these conditions, psychological distress is widespread. UN Women data shows that 75 per cent of women feel regular depression, 62 per cent cannot sleep, and 65 per cent suffer from nightmares and anxiety. But with limited access to care, most are left to cope alone. \n“My mental and psychological health is suffering,” said a 27-year-old pregnant mother of three from Khan Younis. “Sometimes I go to the toilet just to cry and cry until I feel better.” \nWomen are not only dealing with their own trauma—they are also trying to care for their children. Of the women UN Women interviewed, 77 per cent were responsible for feeding and caring for children. \n“I have not prioritized my health because I am the primary caregiver for my children, assuming the roles of both father and mother,” the 27-year-old mother added.  \nThe mental health of women in Gaza is at breaking point. Pregnant women, mothers, and girls are especially vulnerable. The emotional load of keeping families afloat falls heavily on women. The war on women’s health in Gaza is not only physical. It is mental, emotional, and unrelenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      A woman in Gaza looks through the rubble of her devastated home in February 2025.

Among internally displaced people 23 per cent suffer from PTSD, 10 per cent report depression, and 9 per cent from anxiety. Yet, only about a third have accessed care. Many don’t recognize their symptoms or face barriers like cost, stigma, or a lack of services. \nOne study found that PTSD, depression, anxiety, and comorbid conditions contributed to disability increases of up to 16 per cent among conflict-affected women and children. \n“The mental health problem is very serious, especially among children,” said Elene Rusetskaia of the Women’s Information Center. “When they live in these areas, they hear soldiers’ voices, or noise from nearby military tents and it deeply affects them. Even after the fighting stops, there’s almost no psychological support.” \n“We saw very high numbers of women addicted to medication, especially antidepressants, in two regions of Georgia,” Elene added. “When we compared, we saw that these are exactly the areas where IDPs (internally displaced persons) and conflict-affected people live. The correlation is clear. This is a massive issue.”  \nHer organization works to bridge this gap, bringing together officials, NGOs, and health experts to find practical solutions.  \n“These women had no chance to speak to people who could help them,” she said. “Now we bring them together and real help can start.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Elene Rusetskaia, of the of the Women’s Information Center in Georgia. \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine’s women face soaring domestic violence and depression\nIn Ukraine, war has pushed women backwards on every front. Gender-based violence has surged 36 per cent since 2022, women are doing more unpaid care work—up to 56 hours per week just on childcare—and unemployment has soared. This is affecting women’s well-being with 42 per cent now at risk of depression, and 23 per cent reporting that they or someone in their household needs counselling.  \nDisplaced refugees, the majority of whom are women, face some of the worst mental health impacts. Support systems are often out of reach as they flee rural areas or the frontline. An IOM survey found that 53 per cent of internally displaced people in Ukraine suffered from depression. And those seeking help often find little available. \n“Because of the bombing, my children couldn’t sleep and we were all exhausted,” said Snejana, a mother from Odessa. “Until we reached the border, I drove with the windows open to show we had children inside. I only breathed freely once we crossed.” \nWomen from marginalized groups, including Roma women, LGBTQI+ individuals, and women with disabilities, face added layers of trauma and even fewer options for support. Traditional gender roles deepen the pressure, as women carry the emotional weight of supporting families through war, instability, and displacement.  \nIn 2024, UN Women provided protection, legal aid, and psychosocial care to more than 180,000 women and girls in Ukraine through the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Kyiv, Ukraine, women and girls spend the night taking shelter at a metro station during the first days of the war, end of February\r\n2022.

Alison Davidian, UN Women Country Representative in Afghanistan, warns that almost four years of countless Taliban decrees are “eviscerating” the autonomy of women and girls. \nWomen have been erased from public life. There are no women in leadership positions, and 98 per cent of women say they have limited or no influence over decisions in their communities.  \n“Three years ago, an Afghan woman could technically decide to run for president. Now, she may not even be able to decide when to go and buy groceries,” said Davidian. \nSixty-eight per cent of women describe their mental health as “bad” or “very bad”, and eight per cent say they personally know someone who has attempted suicide, according to a recent UN Women report.  \n“The situation is so severe that even talking about it makes them cry,” said Mursalina Amin, founder of Girls toward leadership. “They are trapped—no education, no movement, no self-expression. All those dreams they built in their minds, they are now nothing.” \nStigma makes this worse. “They don’t even have the language to describe what they’re going through,” Amin explained. “Every Afghan girl I’ve spoken to has mental health issues, but they can’t speak about it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Mursalina Amin, founder of the Girls toward leadership organization in Afghanistan.

Living under siege and the constant threat of violence, women and girls face extreme levels of fear, trauma, and exhaustion. \nAs of early 2024, over 1.9 million people—nearly 85 per cent of Gaza’s population—have been forcibly displaced. There is virtually no access to clean water, food, or electricity, healthcare systems have been decimated, and 90 per cent of the population lacks regular access to food. Sanitation systems have collapsed, and women and girls are trapped in overcrowded shelters, with no privacy, basic services, or safety. \nIn these conditions, psychological distress is widespread. UN Women data shows that 75 per cent of women feel regular depression, 62 per cent cannot sleep, and 65 per cent suffer from nightmares and anxiety. But with limited access to care, most are left to cope alone. \n“My mental and psychological health is suffering,” said a 27-year-old pregnant mother of three from Khan Younis. “Sometimes I go to the toilet just to cry and cry until I feel better.” \nWomen are not only dealing with their own trauma—they are also trying to care for their children. Of the women UN Women interviewed, 77 per cent were responsible for feeding and caring for children. \n“I have not prioritized my health because I am the primary caregiver for my children, assuming the roles of both father and mother,” the 27-year-old mother added.  \nThe mental health of women in Gaza is at breaking point. Pregnant women, mothers, and girls are especially vulnerable. The emotional load of keeping families afloat falls heavily on women. The war on women’s health in Gaza is not only physical. It is mental, emotional, and unrelenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      A woman in Gaza looks through the rubble of her devastated home in February 2025.

Among internally displaced people 23 per cent suffer from PTSD, 10 per cent report depression, and 9 per cent from anxiety. Yet, only about a third have accessed care. Many don’t recognize their symptoms or face barriers like cost, stigma, or a lack of services. \nOne study found that PTSD, depression, anxiety, and comorbid conditions contributed to disability increases of up to 16 per cent among conflict-affected women and children. \n“The mental health problem is very serious, especially among children,” said Elene Rusetskaia of the Women’s Information Center. “When they live in these areas, they hear soldiers’ voices, or noise from nearby military tents and it deeply affects them. Even after the fighting stops, there’s almost no psychological support.” \n“We saw very high numbers of women addicted to medication, especially antidepressants, in two regions of Georgia,” Elene added. “When we compared, we saw that these are exactly the areas where IDPs (internally displaced persons) and conflict-affected people live. The correlation is clear. This is a massive issue.”  \nHer organization works to bridge this gap, bringing together officials, NGOs, and health experts to find practical solutions.  \n“These women had no chance to speak to people who could help them,” she said. “Now we bring them together and real help can start.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Elene Rusetskaia, of the of the Women’s Information Center in Georgia. \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine’s women face soaring domestic violence and depression\nIn Ukraine, war has pushed women backwards on every front. Gender-based violence has surged 36 per cent since 2022, women are doing more unpaid care work—up to 56 hours per week just on childcare—and unemployment has soared. This is affecting women’s well-being with 42 per cent now at risk of depression, and 23 per cent reporting that they or someone in their household needs counselling.  \nDisplaced refugees, the majority of whom are women, face some of the worst mental health impacts. Support systems are often out of reach as they flee rural areas or the frontline. An IOM survey found that 53 per cent of internally displaced people in Ukraine suffered from depression. And those seeking help often find little available. \n“Because of the bombing, my children couldn’t sleep and we were all exhausted,” said Snejana, a mother from Odessa. “Until we reached the border, I drove with the windows open to show we had children inside. I only breathed freely once we crossed.” \nWomen from marginalized groups, including Roma women, LGBTQI+ individuals, and women with disabilities, face added layers of trauma and even fewer options for support. Traditional gender roles deepen the pressure, as women carry the emotional weight of supporting families through war, instability, and displacement.  \nIn 2024, UN Women provided protection, legal aid, and psychosocial care to more than 180,000 women and girls in Ukraine through the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Kyiv, Ukraine, women and girls spend the night taking shelter at a metro station during the first days of the war, end of February\r\n2022.

Its horrors live on in the minds of those who have endured it. For women and girls in conflict zones, mental health support is not a luxury.

Among internally displaced people 23 per cent suffer from PTSD, 10 per cent report depression, and 9 per cent from anxiety. Yet, only about a third have accessed care. Many don’t recognize their symptoms or face barriers like cost, stigma, or a lack of services. \nOne study found that PTSD, depression, anxiety, and comorbid conditions contributed to disability increases of up to 16 per cent among conflict-affected women and children. \n“The mental health problem is very serious, especially among children,” said Elene Rusetskaia of the Women’s Information Center. “When they live in these areas, they hear soldiers’ voices, or noise from nearby military tents and it deeply affects them. Even after the fighting stops, there’s almost no psychological support.” \n“We saw very high numbers of women addicted to medication, especially antidepressants, in two regions of Georgia,” Elene added. “When we compared, we saw that these are exactly the areas where IDPs (internally displaced persons) and conflict-affected people live. The correlation is clear. This is a massive issue.”  \nHer organization works to bridge this gap, bringing together officials, NGOs, and health experts to find practical solutions.  \n“These women had no chance to speak to people who could help them,” she said. “Now we bring them together and real help can start.”\n\nUse of antidepressants rising among Georgia’s displaced women\nIn Georgia, years of displacement and conflict have left women and children facing a mental health emergency that shows no sign of slowing.  \nAround 200,000 people remain internally displaced, with nearly 40 per cent living in shelters with poor living conditions, high unemployment, and limited services.  \nThe mental health toll is stark.

Its horrors live on in the minds of those who have endured it. For women and girls in conflict zones, mental health support is not a luxury.

  "summary": "Today, over 600 million women and girls live in conflict-affected areas, a 50 per cent increase since 2017. Despite the alarming data, mental health receives just 1-2 per cent of global health financing, even though mental health and psychosocial conditions account for 20 per cent of health issues reported in emergencies. UN Women spoke to women working in Afghanistan, Gaza, Georgia and Ukraine to understand how crisis is impacting women’s mental health. Alison Davidian, UN Women Country Representative in Afghanistan, warns that almost four years of countless Taliban decrees are “eviscerating” the autonomy of women and girls. There are no women in leadership positions, and 98 per cent of women say they have limited or no influence over decisions in their communities. Sixty-eight per cent of women describe their mental health as “bad” or “very bad”, and eight per cent say they personally know someone who has attempted suicide, according to a recent UN Women report. UN Women data shows that 75 per cent of women feel regular depression, 62 per cent cannot sleep, and 65 per cent suffer from nightmares and anxiety. Of the women UN Women interviewed, 77 per cent were responsible for feeding and caring for children.

Among internally displaced people 23 per cent suffer from PTSD, 10 per cent report depression, and 9 per cent from anxiety. One study found that PTSD, depression, anxiety, and comorbid conditions contributed to disability increases of up to 16 per cent among conflict-affected women and children. Ukraine’s women face soaring domestic violence and depression\nIn Ukraine, war has pushed women backwards on every front. Gender-based violence has surged 36 per cent since 2022, women are doing more unpaid care work—up to 56 hours per week just on childcare—and unemployment has soared. This is affecting women’s well-being with 42 per cent now at risk of depression, and 23 per cent reporting that they or someone in their household needs counselling.
