It enables children and young people to gain knowledge, and develop the skills they need to make conscious, healthy and respectful choices about relationships and sexuality. \nCSE should be accessible both in school and out-of-school, supported by educators, parents, communities and policy makers. CSE should be provided in a way that is non-judgemental, non-discriminatory, scientifically accurate, accessible, inclusive, rights-based, promotes gender equality and is adapted to the age of the child, adolescent or young person. \n\n\nWhat topics does CSE cover? \nCSE covers topics such as:\n\nGender\nSexuality \nRelationships \nConsent \nViolence and staying safe \nThe human body and development \nContraceptive choices \nAbortion care.   \n\n\n\nCSE – the statistics \n\n\nPlan International reports that that 69% participants in projects implementing sexuality education and dialogue activities in 2024 feel able to make informed decisions about their SRHR, including 72% of girls and young women, 67% of boys and young men.  \nIn Loreto, Peru, adolescent pregnancy rates dropped significantly from 47.5% to 25.9% over 5 years due to targeted interventions.  \nEvidence shows that CSE contributes to delayed sexual activity, increased contraceptive use, and reduced risk behaviours, outperforming abstinence-only approaches. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan International is pleasure positive!\nPlan International advocates for integrating pleasure into CSE to promote a rounded and positive view of sexual health.

It helps to build healthy relationships and protects against health risks, violence, and unintended pregnancies. \nResearch shows that CSE delays the age of first sexual experience, improves safer sexual practices, and reduces sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. It also addresses gender inequality, challenges harmful norms, and reduces gender-based violence. Additionally, CSE is cost-effective in preventing negative health outcomes. \n\n\nWho needs CSE?  \n\nCSE is essential for children, adolescents, and young people in all their diversity. CSE should begin in the preschool years, supported by parents, caregivers, traditional and religious leaders, and other gatekeepers to enhance their understanding of the topics covered and increase their support. To achieve this, it is crucial to work with parents and caregivers to build their confidence and skills in discussing sexuality with their children from an early age. \n\n\nHow is Plan International supporting CSE across the globe?\nWe support CSE globally through our evidence-based CSE Programme and Influencing Model, which Plan has developed over several years. \nThis model uses research evidence to provide CSE teaching strategies that are proven to work and cover the cognitive, emotional, physical, and social aspects of sexuality. It teaches a positive approach to sexuality, promoting healthy sexual development and empowering children and young people to navigate and transform gender-unequal environments and is a comprehensive sex education curriculum. \nKey materials developed as part of the CSE model include:  \n\n14 CSE standards to guide educators and ensure a comprehensive, human rights-based, gender-transformative, inclusive, and sex-positive approach. \n\n\nCSE Topics Table that covers 7 key areas of CSE education: relationships, values, rights and sexuality, gender, violence and safety, the human body and development, sexuality and sexual behaviour, and sexual and reproductive health. Guided by WHO and UNESCO, it provides clear, accurate information to empower learners with the knowledge and skills for meaningful sexual and reproductive lives. \n\n\nCSE activity cards for children and adolescents. \n\n\nPeer-based intervention guides for adolescents and young people to learn and support each other. \n\n\nResources to engage parents and caregivers in CSE. \n\n\nStrategies for SRHR in contexts where norms or government policies limit SRHR for young women and girls. \n\n\nCSE Accountability Tool (which has also been endorsed by 13 partners) which provides support to governments to ensure they implement their CSE commitments.

It seeks to transform gendered power relations and tackle root causes of gender inequality and exclusion at the individual, family, community, and state level. \nWith a multi-component approach, it includes working in partnership with vibrant civil society partners, scaling up comprehensive sexuality education, improving access to climate resilient, quality, inclusive, age-and-gender responsive sexual and reproductive health services, and increasing societal and political acceptance of children, adolescent and youth sexuality.\n© Plan International / Mikko Toivonen\n“Before [My Body, My Future], I knew practically nothing about my rights.

It enables children and young people to gain knowledge, and develop the skills they need to make conscious, healthy and respectful choices about relationships and sexuality. \nCSE should be accessible both in school and out-of-school, supported by educators, parents, communities and policy makers. CSE should be provided in a way that is non-judgemental, non-discriminatory, scientifically accurate, accessible, inclusive, rights-based, promotes gender equality and is adapted to the age of the child, adolescent or young person. \n\n\nWhat topics does CSE cover? \nCSE covers topics such as:\n\nGender\nSexuality \nRelationships \nConsent \nViolence and staying safe \nThe human body and development \nContraceptive choices \nAbortion care.   \n\n\n\nCSE – the statistics \n\n\nPlan International reports that that 69% participants in projects implementing sexuality education and dialogue activities in 2024 feel able to make informed decisions about their SRHR, including 72% of girls and young women, 67% of boys and young men.  \nIn Loreto, Peru, adolescent pregnancy rates dropped significantly from 47.5% to 25.9% over 5 years due to targeted interventions.  \nEvidence shows that CSE contributes to delayed sexual activity, increased contraceptive use, and reduced risk behaviours, outperforming abstinence-only approaches. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan International is pleasure positive!\nPlan International advocates for integrating pleasure into CSE to promote a rounded and positive view of sexual health. This approach moves beyond traditional methods that often focus on risks and fear, and embraces discussions on desire, consent, and self-confidence. \nBy addressing sexuality in an inclusive, and empowering way, Plan aims to transform norms around sexual health, fostering confidence and informed decision-making among young people.  \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is CSE important? \n\nCSE equips children and adolescents with the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to make informed sexual and reproductive health decisions. It helps to build healthy relationships and protects against health risks, violence, and unintended pregnancies. \nResearch shows that CSE delays the age of first sexual experience, improves safer sexual practices, and reduces sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. It also addresses gender inequality, challenges harmful norms, and reduces gender-based violence. Additionally, CSE is cost-effective in preventing negative health outcomes. \n\n\nWho needs CSE?  \n\nCSE is essential for children, adolescents, and young people in all their diversity. CSE should begin in the preschool years, supported by parents, caregivers, traditional and religious leaders, and other gatekeepers to enhance their understanding of the topics covered and increase their support. To achieve this, it is crucial to work with parents and caregivers to build their confidence and skills in discussing sexuality with their children from an early age. \n\n\nHow is Plan International supporting CSE across the globe?\nWe support CSE globally through our evidence-based CSE Programme and Influencing Model, which Plan has developed over several years. \nThis model uses research evidence to provide CSE teaching strategies that are proven to work and cover the cognitive, emotional, physical, and social aspects of sexuality. It teaches a positive approach to sexuality, promoting healthy sexual development and empowering children and young people to navigate and transform gender-unequal environments and is a comprehensive sex education curriculum. \nKey materials developed as part of the CSE model include:  \n\n14 CSE standards to guide educators and ensure a comprehensive, human rights-based, gender-transformative, inclusive, and sex-positive approach. \n\n\nCSE Topics Table that covers 7 key areas of CSE education: relationships, values, rights and sexuality, gender, violence and safety, the human body and development, sexuality and sexual behaviour, and sexual and reproductive health. Guided by WHO and UNESCO, it provides clear, accurate information to empower learners with the knowledge and skills for meaningful sexual and reproductive lives. \n\n\nCSE activity cards for children and adolescents. \n\n\nPeer-based intervention guides for adolescents and young people to learn and support each other. \n\n\nResources to engage parents and caregivers in CSE. \n\n\nStrategies for SRHR in contexts where norms or government policies limit SRHR for young women and girls. \n\n\nCSE Accountability Tool (which has also been endorsed by 13 partners) which provides support to governments to ensure they implement their CSE commitments. It is also helpful for advocates who need to hold people accountability for delivering on commitments. \n\n\n\nBuilding bridges\nEngaging parents and caregivers in CSE\nThis 10-session training curriculum gives parents tools to discuss and communicate with their young adolescent children about relationships and sexuality and increase their knowledge of SRHR.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\nCSE influencing work\nPlan is a member of the Global Partnership Forum on CSE (co-founded by UNFPA and UNESCO).

It enables children and young people to gain knowledge, and develop the skills they need to make conscious, healthy and respectful choices about relationships and sexuality.\n\nCSE should be accessible both in school and out-of-school, supported by educators, parents, communities and policy makers. CSE should be provided in a way that is non-judgemental, non-discriminatory, scientifically accurate, accessible, inclusive, rights-based, promotes gender equality and is adapted to the age of the child, adolescent or young person.\n\nWhat topics does CSE cover? \nCSE covers topics such as:\n\nGender\nSexuality \nRelationships \nConsent \nViolence and staying safe \nThe human body and development \nContraceptive choices \nAbortion care.\n\nWhat topics does CSE cover? \nCSE covers topics such as:\n\nGender\nSexuality \nRelationships \nConsent \nViolence and staying safe \nThe human body and development \nContraceptive choices \nAbortion care.\n\nCSE covers topics such as:\n\nPlan International is pleasure positive!\nPlan International advocates for integrating pleasure into CSE to promote a rounded and positive view of sexual health.

It helps to build healthy relationships and protects against health risks, violence, and unintended pregnancies. \nResearch shows that CSE delays the age of first sexual experience, improves safer sexual practices, and reduces sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. It also addresses gender inequality, challenges harmful norms, and reduces gender-based violence. Additionally, CSE is cost-effective in preventing negative health outcomes. \n\n\nWho needs CSE?  \n\nCSE is essential for children, adolescents, and young people in all their diversity. CSE should begin in the preschool years, supported by parents, caregivers, traditional and religious leaders, and other gatekeepers to enhance their understanding of the topics covered and increase their support. To achieve this, it is crucial to work with parents and caregivers to build their confidence and skills in discussing sexuality with their children from an early age.\n\nWhy is CSE important? \n\nCSE equips children and adolescents with the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to make informed sexual and reproductive health decisions.

It teaches a positive approach to sexuality, promoting healthy sexual development and empowering children and young people to navigate and transform gender-unequal environments and is a comprehensive sex education curriculum.\n\nBuilding bridges\nEngaging parents and caregivers in CSE\nThis 10-session training curriculum gives parents tools to discuss and communicate with their young adolescent children about relationships and sexuality and increase their knowledge of SRHR.\n\nRead more\n\nBuilding bridges\nEngaging parents and caregivers in CSE\nThis 10-session training curriculum gives parents tools to discuss and communicate with their young adolescent children about relationships and sexuality and increase their knowledge of SRHR.\n\nRead more\n\nThis 10-session training curriculum gives parents tools to discuss and communicate with their young adolescent children about relationships and sexuality and increase their knowledge of SRHR.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more\n\nPlan is a member of the Global Partnership Forum on CSE (co-founded by UNFPA and UNESCO).

Through our influencing efforts, we have secured stronger language, commitment and investment in CSE within national, regional and global policies, including the UN and other multi-national organisations.\n\nPlan implements CSE in multiple countries, tailoring programmes to meet the needs of different cultural and social contexts, ensuring impactful programmes that are sensitive and adapted to the situation in which they are being hosted.\n\nClick on the tabs below to find out about some of our recent CSE projects:\n\nWest AfricaEthiopia, Laos, Mozambique, Myanmar, Zimbabwe and UgandaBolivia, Philippines & ZimbabweNepalRwandaBangladesh and JordanLatin America and the Caribbean\nWest Africa\n“My Health, My Rights” – meaningful youth engagement in CSE \nThis project is being implemented across 6 West African countries (Benin, Burkina-Faso, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Togo), and focuses on using peer education to deliver CSE.\nIt adapts nationally approved curricula and materials to engage adolescents, especially the most vulnerable, such as married adolescents and adolescents with disabilities, in family and community settings.

Delivering and supporting positive and inclusive comprehensive sexuality education is a core component of our sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) work. CSE – the statistics \n\n\nPlan International reports that that 69% participants in projects implementing sexuality education and dialogue activities in 2024 feel able to make informed decisions about their SRHR, including 72% of girls and young women, 67% of boys and young men. We support CSE globally through our evidence-based CSE Programme and Influencing Model, which Plan has developed over several years. It teaches a positive approach to sexuality, promoting healthy sexual development and empowering children and young people to navigate and transform gender-unequal environments and is a comprehensive sex education curriculum. Key materials developed as part of the CSE model include:  \n\n14 CSE standards to guide educators and ensure a comprehensive, human rights-based, gender-transformative, inclusive, and sex-positive approach. CSE Topics Table that covers 7 key areas of CSE education: relationships, values, rights and sexuality, gender, violence and safety, the human body and development, sexuality and sexual behaviour, and sexual and reproductive health.

CSE – the statistics \n\n\nPlan International reports that that 69% participants in projects implementing sexuality education and dialogue activities in 2024 feel able to make informed decisions about their SRHR, including 72% of girls and young women, 67% of boys and young men. We support CSE globally through our evidence-based CSE Programme and Influencing Model, which Plan has developed over several years. It teaches a positive approach to sexuality, promoting healthy sexual development and empowering children and young people to navigate and transform gender-unequal environments and is a comprehensive sex education curriculum. Key materials developed as part of the CSE model include:  \n\n14 CSE standards to guide educators and ensure a comprehensive, human rights-based, gender-transformative, inclusive, and sex-positive approach. CSE Topics Table that covers 7 key areas of CSE education: relationships, values, rights and sexuality, gender, violence and safety, the human body and development, sexuality and sexual behaviour, and sexual and reproductive health.
