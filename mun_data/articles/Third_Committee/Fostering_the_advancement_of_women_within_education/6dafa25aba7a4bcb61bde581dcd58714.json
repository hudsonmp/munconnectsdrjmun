More than one million people – overwhelmingly Tutsi, but also Hutu and others who opposed the genocide – were systematically killed in less than three months. On the International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda (7 April), we honour those who were murdered and reflect on the suffering of those who survived. To mark the anniversary, the Department of Global Communications and the Permanent Mission of Rwanda to the United Nations are hosting a commemorative event.\n\n\nThe statue “Kwibuka Flame of Hope” symbolizes the resilience and courage of Rwandans since the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.\n\nPhoto:UN/Manuel Elías\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUN rights chief urges probe into Russian attack that killed nine children in Ukraine 6 April 2025 — The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Sunday for an investigation into the Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih which reportedly killed 18 people,...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n More than one million children in Gaza deprived of aid for over a month: UNICEF 5 April 2025 — The blockade of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip is having dire consequences for more than a million children, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said on Saturday.... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘Safe futures start here’: UN calls for global action to eliminate mine threat  4 April 2025 — More than 100 million people worldwide are at risk from landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) Secretary-General António Guterres said on... \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUN Sustainable Development Goals\n17 Goals to transform our worldThe Sustainable Development Goals are a call for action by all countries — poor, rich and middle-income — to promote prosperity while protecting the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n ActNow Campaign \n ActNow is the UN campaign to inspire people to act for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Despite their differing backgrounds, their experiences with racial discrimination were parallel. Bešić recalls being the only Roma child in her elementary school, facing exclusion and mistreatment, while Velásquez Nimatuj felt out of place in a private school environment, aware of the discrimination around her. The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle against racism. Despite progress over the past six decades, racial inequalities continue to affect many lives worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrants, IOM\nWeaving Resilience for Displaced Women and Girls in Ethiopia\nAs the sun rises over the Maidimu internally displaced persons site, women and girls gather in a safe space shelter created for them. Among them is Tsige Mebrthatom, a mother of six who has faced immense hardship but finds strength in these weekly gatherings. Tsige fled her home in Kefta Humera after losing her husband during the conflict in Northern Ethiopia, traveling on foot for five days to reach the Endabaguna camp. Once a thriving merchant in Addis Ababa, her hopes for a fresh start were shattered by the outbreak of conflict in Tigray. Now living in Maidimu, Tsige is one of over 5,000 displaced individuals. Learning traditional crafts has helped Tsige reclaim her identity and serve as a source of strength and inspiration for her children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAO, Water\nGlaciers on borrowed time\nAt 5,100 meters above sea level, Bolivia's Huayna Potosí glacier faces thinning and retreating at an annual rate of about 24 meters. The landscape, once filled with thick blue ice, now reveals bare rock and a newly formed meltwater lake. A team of scientists ascends the glacier to install equipment that measures water accumulation in the form of snow, vital for the glacier's survival. Their work provides crucial data on the impacts of ice loss on ecosystems and communities relying on glacier water. This research aids in raising awareness among decision-makers and establishing an international monitoring network to understand how climate change affects the cryosphere. As glaciers retreat faster than expected, efforts in Bolivia focus on conserving remaining water by creating reservoirs and developing collaborative water usage arrangements to prevent future conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aid, UNHCR\nUNHCR response in emergencies\nUnited Nations Refugee Agency swiftly provides lifesaving aid to displaced people worldwide, mobilizing staff and supplies for 1 million individuals within 72 hours.

The UN does this by working to prevent conflict; helping parties in conflict make peace; peacekeeping; and creating the conditions to allow peace to hold and flourish. These activities often overlap and should reinforce one another, to be effective. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. The General Assembly and the Secretary-General play major, important, and complementary roles, along with other UN offices and bodies.\n \n  \n  \n Protect Human Rights \n The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization.  In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights brought human rights into the realm of international law.  Since then, the Organization has diligently protected human rights through legal instruments and on-the-ground activities.\n \n  \n  \n Deliver Humanitarian Aid \n One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is \"to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.\"  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild.  The Organization is now relied upon by the international community to coordinate humanitarian relief operations due to natural and man-made disasters in areas beyond the relief capacity of national authorities alone.\n \n  \n  \n Promote Sustainable Development \n From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. The global understanding of development has changed over the years, and countries now have agreed that sustainable development offers the best path forward for improving the lives of people everywhere.\n \n  \n  \n Uphold International Law \n The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: \"to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.\"  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization.  This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary.  These powers are given to it by the UN Charter, which is considered an international treaty.  As such, it is an instrument of international law, and UN Member States are bound by it.  The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the United Nations\nThe main parts of the UN structure are the General Assembly, theSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the UN Secretariat. All were established in 1945 when the UN was founded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n General Assembly \n The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the UN. All 193 Member States of the UN are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal representation.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Security Council \n The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. It has 15 Members (5 permanent and 10 non-permanent members). Each Member has one vote. Under the Charter, all Member States are obligated to comply with Council decisions.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Economic and Social Council \n The Economic and Social Council is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as implementation of internationally agreed development goals.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Trusteeship Council \n The Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 by the UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States, and ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence.\n  \n\n  \n  \n International Court of Justice \n The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Its seat is at the Peace Palace in the Hague (Netherlands). It is the only one of the six principal organs of the United Nations not located in New York (United States of America).\n  \n\n  \n  \n Secretariat \n The Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and tens of thousands of international UN staff members who carry out the day-to-day work of the UN as mandated by the General Assembly and the Organization's other principal organs.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nMore about the structure of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n Climate Change \n Climate change is the defining issue of our time and now is the defining moment to do something about it. There is still time to tackle climate change, but it will require an unprecedented effort from all sectors of society.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Gender Equality \n Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and, therefore, also half of its potential. Gender equality, besides being a fundamental human right, is essential to achieve peaceful societies, with full human potential and sustainable development.\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n Ending Poverty \n While global poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 2000, one in ten people in developing regions still lives on less than US$1.90 a day — the internationally agreed poverty line, and millions of others live on slightly more than this daily amount.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Our Common Agenda \n Following up on a pledge made by UN Member States at the UN’s 75th anniversary, the report Our Common Agenda looks ahead to the next 25 years and represents the Secretary-General’s vision on the future of global cooperation. It calls for inclusive, networked, and effective multilateralism to better respond to humanity’s most pressing challenges.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\nAs the world’s only truly universal global organization, the United Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend national boundaries and cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In contemporary conflicts, up to 90 per cent of casualties are civilians. \n  \n Find out more in\nGlobal Issues:\n\tPeace and Security\n  \n\n By 2030, the number of persons 15-24 years of age is projected to grow to nearly 1.3 billion. \n  \n Find out more in\nGlobal Issues:\n\tYouth\n  \n\n\n By 2048, noncommunicable diseases are expected to cause around 77 million of the almost 90 million global annual deaths. \n  \n Find out more in\nGlobal Issues\n\tHealth\n  \n\n\n The advocacy of racial or religious hatred is prohibited by international law. \n  \n Find out more in\nGlobal Issues:\n\tHuman Rights\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch and Listen\nVideo and audio from across the United Nations and our world-wide family of agencies, funds, and programmes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n  \n This glass is radioactive \n This type of glass has been produced for nearly 200 years, and it contains the first ever discovered radioactive element.\nCan you guess what it is? \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n  \n Transforming agriculture in Benin \n Mireille, Eloi, and Daniel transformed their agricultural businesses in Benin by utilizing RuralInvest for growth and funding.\n  \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n  \n Glacier grafting: A Climate solution \n Glacier grafting in Gilgit-Baltistan transplants ice to shaded valleys, creating glaciers that sustainably store and release water, combating climate change.\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUN Podcasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n Facing the TB crisis \n Severe resource shortages are threatening the global response to end tuberculosis.

The family's meal consists of a simple stew made from cassava leaves and a sliver of salted fish. Their children sit on the ground, learning alongside other displaced kids, soon to clamor for their share of the meal.  At 38, Tantine, a mother of seven, laments, “This stew has neither salt nor oil. We are living a difficult life; we have nothing.” Since being forced to flee their village in August 2022 after a brutal attack, her life has been marked by hardship. Despite recovering from abdominal surgery, she endured a long and painful journey that worsened her infection, leaving her wound still open and her psychological scars deeply present after two years.\n  \n\n  \n Photo:UNDP/Snow Leopard Conservation Foundation\n \n Got cheese?\nTsendsuren Byambaa, born in Mongolia's Khovd Province in 1970, is a herder and mother of six.

All were established in 1945 when the UN was founded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n General Assembly \n The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the UN. All 193 Member States of the UN are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal representation.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Security Council \n The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. It has 15 Members (5 permanent and 10 non-permanent members). Each Member has one vote. Under the Charter, all Member States are obligated to comply with Council decisions.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Economic and Social Council \n The Economic and Social Council is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as implementation of internationally agreed development goals.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Trusteeship Council \n The Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 by the UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States, and ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence.\n  \n\n  \n  \n International Court of Justice \n The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Its seat is at the Peace Palace in the Hague (Netherlands). It is the only one of the six principal organs of the United Nations not located in New York (United States of America).\n  \n\n  \n  \n Secretariat \n The Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and tens of thousands of international UN staff members who carry out the day-to-day work of the UN as mandated by the General Assembly and the Organization's other principal organs.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nMore about the structure of the United Nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n Climate Change \n Climate change is the defining issue of our time and now is the defining moment to do something about it. There is still time to tackle climate change, but it will require an unprecedented effort from all sectors of society.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Gender Equality \n Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and, therefore, also half of its potential. Gender equality, besides being a fundamental human right, is essential to achieve peaceful societies, with full human potential and sustainable development.\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n Ending Poverty \n While global poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 2000, one in ten people in developing regions still lives on less than US$1.90 a day — the internationally agreed poverty line, and millions of others live on slightly more than this daily amount.\n  \n\n  \n  \n Our Common Agenda \n Following up on a pledge made by UN Member States at the UN’s 75th anniversary, the report Our Common Agenda looks ahead to the next 25 years and represents the Secretary-General’s vision on the future of global cooperation. It calls for inclusive, networked, and effective multilateralism to better respond to humanity’s most pressing challenges.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\nAs the world’s only truly universal global organization, the United Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend national boundaries and cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In contemporary conflicts, up to 90 per cent of casualties are civilians. \n  \n Find out more in\nGlobal Issues:\n\tPeace and Security\n  \n\n By 2030, the number of persons 15-24 years of age is projected to grow to nearly 1.3 billion. \n  \n Find out more in\nGlobal Issues:\n\tYouth\n  \n\n\n By 2048, noncommunicable diseases are expected to cause around 77 million of the almost 90 million global annual deaths. \n  \n Find out more in\nGlobal Issues\n\tHealth\n  \n\n\n The advocacy of racial or religious hatred is prohibited by international law. \n  \n Find out more in\nGlobal Issues:\n\tHuman Rights\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch and Listen\nVideo and audio from across the United Nations and our world-wide family of agencies, funds, and programmes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n  \n This glass is radioactive \n This type of glass has been produced for nearly 200 years, and it contains the first ever discovered radioactive element.\nCan you guess what it is? \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n  \n Transforming agriculture in Benin \n Mireille, Eloi, and Daniel transformed their agricultural businesses in Benin by utilizing RuralInvest for growth and funding.\n  \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n  \n Glacier grafting: A Climate solution \n Glacier grafting in Gilgit-Baltistan transplants ice to shaded valleys, creating glaciers that sustainably store and release water, combating climate change.\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUN Podcasts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n Facing the TB crisis \n Severe resource shortages are threatening the global response to end tuberculosis.

The family's meal consists of a simple stew made from cassava leaves and a sliver of salted fish. Their children sit on the ground, learning alongside other displaced kids, soon to clamor for their share of the meal.  At 38, Tantine, a mother of seven, laments, “This stew has neither salt nor oil. We are living a difficult life; we have nothing.” Since being forced to flee their village in August 2022 after a brutal attack, her life has been marked by hardship. Despite recovering from abdominal surgery, she endured a long and painful journey that worsened her infection, leaving her wound still open and her psychological scars deeply present after two years.\n  \n\n  \n Photo:UNDP/Snow Leopard Conservation Foundation\n \n Got cheese?\nTsendsuren Byambaa, born in Mongolia's Khovd Province in 1970, is a herder and mother of six. She moves her family’s camps seasonally, residing in winter on the slopes of Mt Khairkhan. In 2009, she joined the Snow Leopard Enterprises (SLE) programme, which supports rural herders with income opportunities while promoting conservation. Trained in wool processing and handicrafts, she is now collaborating with the Snow Leopard Conservation Foundation to develop a local cheese production industry in her province and six surrounding communities.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nSee more UN photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Main Bodies   General Assembly   GA President   Security Council   SC President   Economic and Social Council   ECOSOC President   Trusteeship Council   International Court of Justice   Secretariat   Secretary-General       Departments / Offices   New York   Geneva   Nairobi   Vienna   UN System Directory   UN System Chart   Global Leadership   UN Information Centres       Resources / Services   Emergency information   Reporting Wrongdoing   UN Journal   Documents   Guidelines for gender-inclusive language   Databases   Library   UN iLibrary   UN Chronicle   UN Yearbook   Bookshop   Publications for sale   Maps   Media Accreditation   NGO accreditation at ECOSOC   NGO accreditation at DGC   Visitors’ services   Exhibits   Procurement   Employment   Internships   Model UN   Academic Impact   UN Archives   UN Audiovisual Library   How to donate to the UN system   Information on COVID-19 (Coronavirus)   Africa Renewal   Ten ways the UN makes a difference   GA High-level week 2024       Key Documents   UN Charter   Universal Declaration of Human Rights   Convention on the Rights of the Child   Statute of the International Court of Justice   Annual Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization       News and Media   News   Press Releases   Briefings   Spokesperson   Photos   UNIfeed   UN Web TV   UN Video   Social Media   The Essential UN   Awake at Night podcast       Issues / Campaigns   Global Issues   Observances   Sustainable Development Goals   Our Common Agenda   The Summit of the Future   Climate Action   Peace and Security   Action for Peacekeeping (A4P)   Global Crisis Response Group   Call to Action for Human Rights   Disability Inclusion Strategy   Fight Racism   Hate Speech   LGBTIQ+ People   Safety of Journalists   Rule of Law   Action to Counter Terrorism   Victims of Terrorism   Children and Armed Conflict   Violence Against Children (SRSG)   Sexual Violence in Conflict   Refugees and Migrants   Action Agenda on Internal Displacement   Spotlight Initiative   Preventing Sexual Exploitation and Abuse   Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility to Protect   The Rwanda Genocide   The Holocaust   The Question of Palestine   The Transatlantic Slave Trade   Decolonization   Messengers of Peace   Roadmap for Digital Cooperation   Digital Financing Task Force   Data Strategy   Information Integrity   Countering Disinformation   UN75: 2020 and Beyond   Women Rise for All   Stop the Red Sea Catastrophe   Black Sea Grain Initiative Joint Coordination Centre\n\nGénocide, Human Rights\nA tribute to the victims, a reflection on the survivors\nThirty-one years ago, the world witnessed one of the most tragic events in recent human history.

Despite their differing backgrounds, their experiences with racial discrimination were parallel. Bešić recalls being the only Roma child in her elementary school, facing exclusion and mistreatment, while Velásquez Nimatuj felt out of place in a private school environment, aware of the discrimination around her. The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle against racism.

Among them is Tsige Mebrthatom, a mother of six who has faced immense hardship but finds strength in these weekly gatherings. Tsige fled her home in Kefta Humera after losing her husband during the conflict in Northern Ethiopia, traveling on foot for five days to reach the Endabaguna camp. Once a thriving merchant in Addis Ababa, her hopes for a fresh start were shattered by the outbreak of conflict in Tigray. Now living in Maidimu, Tsige is one of over 5,000 displaced individuals. Learning traditional crafts has helped Tsige reclaim her identity and serve as a source of strength and inspiration for her children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAO, Water\nGlaciers on borrowed time\nAt 5,100 meters above sea level, Bolivia's Huayna Potosí glacier faces thinning and retreating at an annual rate of about 24 meters. The landscape, once filled with thick blue ice, now reveals bare rock and a newly formed meltwater lake. A team of scientists ascends the glacier to install equipment that measures water accumulation in the form of snow, vital for the glacier's survival. Their work provides crucial data on the impacts of ice loss on ecosystems and communities relying on glacier water. This research aids in raising awareness among decision-makers and establishing an international monitoring network to understand how climate change affects the cryosphere. As glaciers retreat faster than expected, efforts in Bolivia focus on conserving remaining water by creating reservoirs and developing collaborative water usage arrangements to prevent future conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Aid, UNHCR\nUNHCR response in emergencies\nUnited Nations Refugee Agency swiftly provides lifesaving aid to displaced people worldwide, mobilizing staff and supplies for 1 million individuals within 72 hours.

Tsige fled her home in Kefta Humera after losing her husband during the conflict in Northern Ethiopia, traveling on foot for five days to reach the Endabaguna camp. Once a thriving merchant in Addis Ababa, her hopes for a fresh start were shattered by the outbreak of conflict in Tigray. Now living in Maidimu, Tsige is one of over 5,000 displaced individuals. Learning traditional crafts has helped Tsige reclaim her identity and serve as a source of strength and inspiration for her children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAO, Water\nGlaciers on borrowed time\nAt 5,100 meters above sea level, Bolivia's Huayna Potosí glacier faces thinning and retreating at an annual rate of about 24 meters.

More from the United Nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we do\nDue to the powers vested in its Charter and its unique international character, the United Nations can take action on the issues confronting humanity in the 21st century, including:Maintain international peace and securityProtect human rightsDeliver humanitarian aidPromote sustainable developmentUphold international law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n Maintain International Peace and Security \n The United Nations came into being in 1945, following the devastation of the Second World War, with one central mission: the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. Protect Human Rights \n The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. Deliver Humanitarian Aid \n One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is \"to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.\"  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. Promote Sustainable Development \n From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. Uphold International Law \n The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: \"to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.\"  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations. Structure of the United Nations\nThe main parts of the UN structure are the General Assembly, theSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the UN Secretariat. All 193 Member States of the UN are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal representation. Security Council \n The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. Economic and Social Council \n The Economic and Social Council is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as implementation of internationally agreed development goals. Trusteeship Council \n The Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 by the UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States, and ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence. International Court of Justice \n The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Secretariat \n The Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and tens of thousands of international UN staff members who carry out the day-to-day work of the UN as mandated by the General Assembly and the Organization's other principal organs. Our Common Agenda \n Following up on a pledge made by UN Member States at the UN’s 75th anniversary, the report Our Common Agenda looks ahead to the next 25 years and represents the Secretary-General’s vision on the future of global cooperation.

The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. Protect Human Rights \n The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. Deliver Humanitarian Aid \n One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is \"to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.\"  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. Promote Sustainable Development \n From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. Uphold International Law \n The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: \"to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.\"  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations. Structure of the United Nations\nThe main parts of the UN structure are the General Assembly, theSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the UN Secretariat. All 193 Member States of the UN are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal representation. Security Council \n The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. Economic and Social Council \n The Economic and Social Council is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as implementation of internationally agreed development goals. Trusteeship Council \n The Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 by the UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States, and ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence. International Court of Justice \n The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Secretariat \n The Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and tens of thousands of international UN staff members who carry out the day-to-day work of the UN as mandated by the General Assembly and the Organization's other principal organs. Our Common Agenda \n Following up on a pledge made by UN Member States at the UN’s 75th anniversary, the report Our Common Agenda looks ahead to the next 25 years and represents the Secretary-General’s vision on the future of global cooperation.

Maintain International Peace and Security \n The United Nations came into being in 1945, following the devastation of the Second World War, with one central mission: the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. Protect Human Rights \n The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. Deliver Humanitarian Aid \n One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is \"to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.\"  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. Promote Sustainable Development \n From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. Uphold International Law \n The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: \"to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.\"  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization.
