From the suffragists to digital activists, each generation has pushed boundaries, shattered barriers, and refused to step back. Behind every policy change and legal victory there have been fearless feminists organizing, protesting, and demanding action.  \nThe world today is more equal for women and girls than ever before — but progress is still too slow, too fragile, and too uneven. Every 10 minutes, a woman is murdered by someone in her own family. Women's representation in the labour force has remained unchanged for decades. Women and girls contribute the least to climate change and yet suffer the worst consequences. And at this pace, a girl born today will be 40 years old before women hold as many seats in parliament as men. \nIn 1995, world leaders committed to gender equality with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a groundbreaking plan that set bold goals for women’s rights. Two decades later, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reinforced that commitment with a looming 2030 deadline. \nWe cannot afford any setbacks. We cannot wait another 30 years to fulfil the pledge for equality. 2025 is our turning point — starting 8 March, International Women’s Day, we march forward for ALL women and girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of women's rights from 1848 to 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  1848\n                              \n\nThe movement to claim women’s rights takes off \n\n\n\nAt the Seneca Falls Convention in New York, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott demand civil, social, and political rights for women.

From the suffragists to digital activists, each generation has pushed boundaries, shattered barriers, and refused to step back. Behind every policy change and legal victory there have been fearless feminists organizing, protesting, and demanding action.  \nThe world today is more equal for women and girls than ever before — but progress is still too slow, too fragile, and too uneven. Every 10 minutes, a woman is murdered by someone in her own family. Women's representation in the labour force has remained unchanged for decades. Women and girls contribute the least to climate change and yet suffer the worst consequences. And at this pace, a girl born today will be 40 years old before women hold as many seats in parliament as men. \nIn 1995, world leaders committed to gender equality with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a groundbreaking plan that set bold goals for women’s rights. Two decades later, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reinforced that commitment with a looming 2030 deadline. \nWe cannot afford any setbacks.

From the suffragists to digital activists, each generation has pushed boundaries, shattered barriers, and refused to step back. Behind every policy change and legal victory there have been fearless feminists organizing, protesting, and demanding action.  \nThe world today is more equal for women and girls than ever before — but progress is still too slow, too fragile, and too uneven. Every 10 minutes, a woman is murdered by someone in her own family. Women's representation in the labour force has remained unchanged for decades. Women and girls contribute the least to climate change and yet suffer the worst consequences. And at this pace, a girl born today will be 40 years old before women hold as many seats in parliament as men. \nIn 1995, world leaders committed to gender equality with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a groundbreaking plan that set bold goals for women’s rights. Two decades later, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reinforced that commitment with a looming 2030 deadline. \nWe cannot afford any setbacks. We cannot wait another 30 years to fulfil the pledge for equality. 2025 is our turning point — starting 8 March, International Women’s Day, we march forward for ALL women and girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of women's rights from 1848 to 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  1848\n                              \n\nThe movement to claim women’s rights takes off \n\n\n\nAt the Seneca Falls Convention in New York, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott demand civil, social, and political rights for women.

From the suffragists to digital activists, each generation has pushed boundaries, shattered barriers, and refused to step back. Behind every policy change and legal victory there have been fearless feminists organizing, protesting, and demanding action.  \nThe world today is more equal for women and girls than ever before — but progress is still too slow, too fragile, and too uneven. Every 10 minutes, a woman is murdered by someone in her own family. Women's representation in the labour force has remained unchanged for decades. Women and girls contribute the least to climate change and yet suffer the worst consequences. And at this pace, a girl born today will be 40 years old before women hold as many seats in parliament as men. \nIn 1995, world leaders committed to gender equality with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a groundbreaking plan that set bold goals for women’s rights. Two decades later, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reinforced that commitment with a looming 2030 deadline. \nWe cannot afford any setbacks. We cannot wait another 30 years to fulfil the pledge for equality. 2025 is our turning point — starting 8 March, International Women’s Day, we march forward for ALL women and girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of women's rights from 1848 to 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  1848\n                              \n\nThe movement to claim women’s rights takes off \n\n\n\nAt the Seneca Falls Convention in New York, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott demand civil, social, and political rights for women.

From the suffragists to digital activists, each generation has pushed boundaries, shattered barriers, and refused to step back. Behind every policy change and legal victory there have been fearless feminists organizing, protesting, and demanding action.  \nThe world today is more equal for women and girls than ever before — but progress is still too slow, too fragile, and too uneven. Every 10 minutes, a woman is murdered by someone in her own family. Women's representation in the labour force has remained unchanged for decades. Women and girls contribute the least to climate change and yet suffer the worst consequences. And at this pace, a girl born today will be 40 years old before women hold as many seats in parliament as men. \nIn 1995, world leaders committed to gender equality with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a groundbreaking plan that set bold goals for women’s rights. Two decades later, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reinforced that commitment with a looming 2030 deadline. \nWe cannot afford any setbacks. We cannot wait another 30 years to fulfil the pledge for equality. 2025 is our turning point — starting 8 March, International Women’s Day, we march forward for ALL women and girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of women's rights from 1848 to 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  1848\n                              \n\nThe movement to claim women’s rights takes off \n\n\n\nAt the Seneca Falls Convention in New York, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott demand civil, social, and political rights for women.
