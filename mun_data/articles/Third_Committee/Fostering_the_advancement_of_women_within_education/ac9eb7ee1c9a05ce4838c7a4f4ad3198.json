The anti-rights movements are so well organized and infiltrating spaces, including spaces of power, they are far more resourced.

There is still a long way to go to fully implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in an equal, inclusive, and sustainable manner.”\nNadine Gasman, President of the National Institute for Women of Mexico: “We need a Pact of the Future with a gender and intersectional perspective, as there is no viable way to guarantee a healthy, peaceful, and secure world for future generations without it.”\nIsabelle Rome, Ambassador for Human Rights, France: “There will be no equality as long as there is violence against women. We must end the impunity of perpetrators: criminalize and punish offenders, but also, better protect victims, compensate for their harm and suffering, and prevent violence through education.”\nAnne Wang'ombe, Principal Secretary for Gender and Affirmative Action, Kenya: “Kenya has always accorded high priority to matters of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls.

The Platform for Action provides a roadmap toward equality. While new challenges and opportunities have risen since then, the solutions are clear.\nAt the event, UN Women highlighted six priority areas of action and investment that put women and girls and youth at the centre of these efforts to unlock the biggest impact and finally deliver the promises made to women and girls.\nAccelerate gender parity in national and local government by applying temporary special measures to rapidly increase women’s shares of decision-making positions.\nAdopt and fund national action plans to end violence against women, and support and coordinate with community-led mechanisms to extend the reach of services.\nCentre women and girls in a global just transition to green economies by prioritizing them in developing new skills and gaining green jobs.\nBridge the digital gender gap by providing women with equal access to technology and its benefits, including mobile phones and the Internet.\nTransform the care economy to support women’s economic empowerment by increasing national budgets for equitable, quality public care services.\nDrive accountability for the women, peace and security agenda and gender responsive humanitarian action by adopting fully financed national action plans and funding local women’s organizations leading responses to crises and conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Equal is Greater\n  \n\nWhen actions deliver for women and girls, everyone benefits. The world has a plan to achieve gender equality and the rights and empowerment of women and girls: the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Everyone can take action to achieve an equal world where all voices are heard, all rights are respected, and all people enjoy equal opportunity.\n\n\n      Read more\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Karen Davila, an award-winning broadcast journalist, television news anchor, radio presenter, and UN Women National Goodwill Ambassador for the Philippines, moderates the event, “Beijing+30: Achieving Gender Equality, Rights and Empowerment for All Women and Girls” at the United Nations headquarters in New York, on the sidelines of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly.

As UN Women’s latest report, the “Gender Snapshot 2024” shows, the world is missing out on enormous dividends by not investing in gender equality. \nClosing the gender gaps in education and skills could add $10 trillion to the global economy.\nEnding the digital gender divide could save over $500 billion.\nInvesting in the care economy could create nearly 300 million jobs.\nHuang Xiaowei, Minister and Deputy Head of the National Working Committee on Children and Women of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China: “The global landscape is fast evolving, and the development gap is widening, and women’s development is at risk of regression. Today 1 in 10 women live in extreme poverty and nearly 600 million live in conflict-affected areas. There is still a long way to go to fully implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in an equal, inclusive, and sustainable manner.”\nNadine Gasman, President of the National Institute for Women of Mexico: “We need a Pact of the Future with a gender and intersectional perspective, as there is no viable way to guarantee a healthy, peaceful, and secure world for future generations without it.”\nIsabelle Rome, Ambassador for Human Rights, France: “There will be no equality as long as there is violence against women. We must end the impunity of perpetrators: criminalize and punish offenders, but also, better protect victims, compensate for their harm and suffering, and prevent violence through education.”\nAnne Wang'ombe, Principal Secretary for Gender and Affirmative Action, Kenya: “Kenya has always accorded high priority to matters of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. Since the landmark 1985 World Conference on the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies that reviewed and appraised the achievements of the UN Decade of Women and the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the country has made significant progress in and around the 12 critical areas of concern.”\nBirgitte Nygaard Markussen, Director for Humanitarian Action and Civil society Department, Denmark: “It is our hope that the outcomes of Beijing+30 and the outcome of the International Conference on Financing for Development will lead to strong international commitments that place financing for gender equality at the core.”\n\nProgress on women’s rights and gender equality\nSpeakers highlighted that despite significant strides, progress on gender equality, the rights and empowerment of all women and girls remains slow.
