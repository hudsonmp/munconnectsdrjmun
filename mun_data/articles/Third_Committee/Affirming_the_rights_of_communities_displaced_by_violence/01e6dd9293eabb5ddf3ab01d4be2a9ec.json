  "text": "Press Release  Myanmar Earthquake: IRC Teams Report Unprecedented Destruction\n\n\nYangon, Myanmar, March 31, 2025 —  Reports from International Rescue Committee (IRC) teams working in central Myanmar and Shan State reveal the staggering scale of humanitarian needs in the aftermath of Friday’s earthquake. While the death toll has reportedly reached 1,700, the full extent of casualties and displacement remains uncertain. People urgently require medical care, clean drinking water, tents, food, and other basic necessities. The trauma and shock triggered by the earthquake underscore the critical need for mental health support. The IRC partners have started distributing essential support to the earthquake-hit communities, including water, hygiene kits, and critical medical assistance. The IRC mobile medical health team is on its way to Mandalay with essential medicine to provide life-saving aid. Humanitarian response teams are currently facing major challenges, including road damage, debris, and landslides that limit access. Supply chains are disrupted, telecommunications are down, and power systems are severely damaged. Additionally, financial service disruptions, including mobile banking outages, are hindering urgent assistance.  One of the IRC staff members reports from  Mandalay:  “I have lived through several earthquakes in my life, but I have never experienced anything like this. The most powerful shaking lasted only a few seconds, and many people immediately ran out of their houses. “Having lived through the terror of the earthquake, people now fear aftershocks and are sleeping outside on roads or in open fields. However, in towns and cities, safe spaces are scarce. There is an urgent need for tents, as even those whose homes remain intact are too afraid to sleep indoors. “We are also running out of water for both drinking and daily use. Only small water bottles are available, but they are rare and expensive. Telecommunication lines are unreliable, especially in downtown areas, and there is no electricity at all. “Hospitals are overwhelmed with trauma cases, and many hospital buildings are unusable. Patients are being treated on beds placed outside due to fears of buildings collapsing. However, beyond emergency cases, people are unable to prioritise their health as they struggle to meet their basic survival needs.” About IRC in Myanmar The IRC initiated an emergency response in Myanmar following Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The IRC has worked with local partners to expand its activities since then. \n\n\n\nFollow UsAbout the IRCThe International Rescue Committee responds to the world’s worst humanitarian crises, helping to restore health, safety, education, economic wellbeing, and power to people devastated by conflict and disaster.
