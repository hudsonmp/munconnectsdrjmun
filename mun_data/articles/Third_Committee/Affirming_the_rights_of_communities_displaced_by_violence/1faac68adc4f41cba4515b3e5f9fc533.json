IRC teams are on the ground delivering urgent support to survivors. Our teams report staggering humanitarian needs.Survivors urgently need medical care, clean drinking water, tents, food and other basic necessities. Give todayYour support will help the IRC scale up life-saving programs in Myanmar. Donate nowWhat are the impacts of the earthquake in Myanmar?On March 28, 2025, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar, near Mandalay. Minutes later a second 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit, followed by several powerful aftershocks. Due to the earthquake’s shallow depth, destruction spread across the region, including in neighboring Thailand and Bangladesh. Myanmar’s government has declared a state of emergency in six regions. While the death toll has reportedly exceeded 2,800, with thousands more injured, the full extent of casualties and displacement remains uncertain, and it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of the destruction. IRC teams are reporting staggering humanitarian needs. Survivors urgently require medical care, clean drinking water, tents, food and other basic necessities. The trauma and shock triggered by the earthquake have created a need for mental health support.First responders face a number of challenges. Road damage, debris and landslides are limiting humanitarian access and movement. Communications are severely impacted with landline, mobile, and internet networks shut down as electricity systems have been seriously damaged. The earthquake has caused severe destruction in Myanmar. Downed power lines, debris and limited communications contribute to the difficulties of delivering aid to heavily impacted communities.Photo: Myo Min Tun for the IRCHospitals are overwhelmed Hospitals in Mandalay, Myanmar are overwhelmed, with many people forced to wait outside for treatment. Damage to power supplies has led to widespread electricity outages, further straining medical facilities already affected by the earthquake. With limited resources, many survivors are unable to access medical treatment.Meanwhile, disruptions to water and sanitation systems have increased the risk of water-borne disease outbreaks, like cholera. Seasonal water shortages are expected to further strain access to clean water as temperatures surpass 104°F (40°C).An IRC staff member reports from Mandalay, Myanmar:Hospitals are overwhelmed with trauma cases, and many hospital buildings are unusable.
