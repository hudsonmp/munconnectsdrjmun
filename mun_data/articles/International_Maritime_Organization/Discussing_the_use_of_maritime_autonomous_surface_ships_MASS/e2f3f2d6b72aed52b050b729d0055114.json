Protection of RNSS from harmful interference affecting civilian and humanitarian operations2. Strengthening resilience of RNSS-dependent navigation, positioning, and timing systems3. Maintaining conventional navigation infrastructure for contingency support4. Enhancing collaboration between regulatory, aviation, maritime, defense, and enforcement authorities5. Implementing comprehensive interference reporting mechanismsThis initiative builds on ICAO Assembly Resolution A41-8/C, which urges States to ensure close collaboration between aviation authorities, military authorities, service providers, and spectrum enforcement authorities to protect Communication and Navigation Systems. The Resolution specifically calls on States to refrain from any form of jamming or spoofing affecting civil aviation and to coordinate with air navigation service providers when military or security operations might affect civil aviation operations. About ICAO  A specialized agency of the United Nations, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) leads the international alignment of technical standards and strategies, facilitating the safe, secure, and sustainable development of its 193 Member States' aviation sectors and air services.
