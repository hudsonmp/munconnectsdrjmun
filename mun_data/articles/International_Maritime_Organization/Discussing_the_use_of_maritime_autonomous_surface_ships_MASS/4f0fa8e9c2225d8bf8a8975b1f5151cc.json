  "text": "Shipping is the safest and most environmentally benign form of commercial transport. Perhaps uniquely amongst industries involving physical risk, commitment to safety has long pervaded virtually all deep sea shipping operations. Shipping was amongst the very first industries to adopt widely implemented international safety standards.\nBecause of its inherently international nature, the safety of shipping is regulated by various United Nations agencies, in particular the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which has developed a comprehensive framework of global maritime safety regulations.\nThe Principal Regulations Governing Maritime Safety\nThe following are the major international shipping conventions, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (and the International Labour Organization) concerning safety and pollution prevention. However, many other maritime instruments concerning more specific issues are also in force worldwide.\nDealing with the ship – SOLAS, MARPOL, COLREG, LOADLINE AND ISPS\nSOLAS (International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974) lays down a comprehensive range of minimum standards for the safe construction of ships and the basic safety equipment (e.g. fire protection, navigation, lifesaving and radio) to be carried on board. SOLAS also requires regular ship surveys and the issue by flag states of certificates of compliance.\nMARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973/1978) contains requirements to prevent pollution that may be caused both accidentally and in the course of routine operations. MARPOL concerns the prevention of pollution from oil, bulk chemicals, dangerous goods, sewage, garbage and atmospheric pollution, and includes provisions such as those which require certain oil tankers to have double hulls.\nCOLREG (Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972) lays down the basic “rules of the road”, such as rights of way and actions to avoid collisions.\nLOADLINE (International Convention on Loadlines, 1966) sets the minimum permissible free board, according to the season of the year and the ship’s trading pattern.\nISPS (The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, 2002) includes mandatory requirements to ensure ships and port facilities are secure at all stages during a voyage.\nDealing with the shipping company\nISM (The International Safety Management Code, 1993) effectively requires shipping companies to have a licence to operate. Companies and their ships must undergo regular audits to ensure that a safety management system is in place, including adequate procedures and lines of communication between ships and their managers ashore.\nDealing with the seafarer\nSTCW (International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978/1995/2010) establishes uniform standards of competence for seafarers.\nILO 147 (The ILO Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1976) requires national administrations to have effective legislation on labour issues such as hours of work, medical fitness and seafarers’ working conditions. This was superseded by the ILO Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 which entered into force on 30 August 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGuidelines\n\r\n                Guidelines on the Application of the ILO Maritime Labour Convention, Fourth Edition            \n\n\r\n\t\t\tMay 2023        \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGuidelines\n\r\n                Guidelines on the Application of the IMO International Safety Management (ISM) Code            \n\n\r\n\t\t\tDecember 2019        \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGuidelines\n\r\n                Guidelines on the IMO STCW Convention, Fourth Edition            \n\n\r\n\t\t\tFebruary 2023        \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArchive\n\r\n                Maritime Security: A Comprehensive Guide for Shipowners, Seafarers and Administrations, First Edition            \n\n\r\n\t\t\tApril 2021        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Related content                        \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGuidelines\n\r\n                Engine Room Procedures Guide, Second Edition            \n\n\r\n\t\t\tFebruary 2024        \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGuidelines\n\r\n                The Master’s Practical Guide to Maritime Law, First Edition            \n\n\r\n\t\t\tNovember 2023        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmission\n\r\n                MSC 107-19-INF.6 – Best practice industry publications released in 2022/2023 and relevant to the Maritime Safety Committee            \n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t15 March 2023        \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPress Release\n\r\n                International Chamber of Shipping updates health guidance on Coronavirus (COVID-19) to reflect latest knowledge            \n\n\r\n\t\t\t30 September 2020\n\nShipping is the safest and most environmentally benign form of commercial transport.
