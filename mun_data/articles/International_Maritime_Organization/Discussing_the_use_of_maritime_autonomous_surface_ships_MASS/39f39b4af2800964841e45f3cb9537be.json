The engagement of fishers under the age of 18 for work\n                                at night shall be prohibited. For the purpose of this Article,\n                                \"night\" shall be defined in accordance with national law and\n                                practice. It shall cover a period of at least nine hours starting no\n                                later than midnight and ending no earlier than 5 a.m. An exception\n                                to strict compliance with the night work restriction may be made by\n                                the competent authority when: (a) the effective training of the fishers concerned, in\n                                        accordance with established programmes and schedules, would\n                                        be impaired; or(b) the specific nature of the duty or a recognized training\n                                        programme requires that fishers covered by the exception\n                                        perform duties at night and the authority determines, after\n                                        consultation, that the work will not have a detrimental\n                                        impact on their health or well-being.7. Nothing in this Article shall affect any obligations\n                                assumed by the Member arising from the ratification of any other\n                                international labour Convention.Medical examinationArticle 101.

The competent authority, after consultation, may grant\n                                exemptions from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article,\n                                taking into account the safety and health of fishers, size of the\n                                vessel, availability of medical assistance and evacuation, duration\n                                of the voyage, area of operation, and type of fishing\n                                operation.3. The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not\n                                apply to a fisher working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length\n                                and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n                                In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisher to work\n                                on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration\n                                until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the\n                                fisher is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a\n                                recent date.Article 11Each Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing\n                            for:(a) the nature of medical examinations;(b) the form and content of medical certificates;(c) the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical\n                                practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning\n                                eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as\n                                qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy\n                                full independence in exercising their professional judgement;(d) the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity\n                                of medical certificates;(e) the right to a further examination by a second independent\n                                medical practitioner in the event that a person has been refused a\n                                certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may\n                                perform; and(f) other relevant requirements.Article 12In addition to the requirements set out in Article 10 and Article 11, on\n                            a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which\n                            normally remains at sea for more than three days:1. The medical certificate of a fisher shall state, at a\n                                minimum, that: (a) the hearing and sight of the fisher concerned are\n                                        satisfactory for the fisher's duties on the vessel; and(b) the fisher is not suffering from any medical condition\n                                        likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the\n                                        fisher unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or\n                                        health of other persons on board.2. The medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum\n                                period of two years unless the fisher is under the age of 18, in\n                                which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year.3. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in\n                                the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until\n                                the end of that voyage.Part IV.

However, in such circumstances, it\n                                shall require that fishers shall receive compensatory periods of\n                                rest as soon as practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may\n                                establish alternative requirements to those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\n                                this Article. However, such alternative requirements shall be\n                                substantially equivalent and shall not jeopardize the safety and\n                                health of the fishers.4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the\n                                right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisher to perform any\n                                hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the\n                                persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving\n                                assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea.\n                                Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest\n                                and require a fisher to perform any hours of work necessary until\n                                the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after\n                                the normal situation has been restored, the skipper shall ensure\n                                that any fishers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period\n                                are provided with an adequate period of rest.Crew listArticle 15Every fishing vessel shall carry a crew list, a copy of which shall be\n                            provided to authorized persons ashore prior to departure of the vessel,\n                            or communicated ashore immediately after departure of the vessel.

The competent authority may, after\n                            consultation, also apply the requirements of this Annex to existing\n                            vessels, when and in so far as it determines that this is reasonable and\n                            practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4. Any variations made by a Member under paragraph 3 of this\n                            Annex shall be reported to the International Labour Office under article\n                            22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.5. The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.Insulation18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.Other19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20. Emergency escapes from all crew accommodation spaces\n                            shall be provided as necessary.Noise and vibration21. The competent authority shall take measures to limit\n                            excessive noise and vibration in accommodation spaces and, as far as\n                            practicable, in accordance with relevant international standards.22. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the\n                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in\n                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers\n                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of\n                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Accommodation spaces shall be ventilated, taking into\n                            account climatic conditions. The system of ventilation shall supply air\n                            in a satisfactory condition whenever fishers are on board.24. Ventilation arrangements or other measures shall be such\n                            as to protect non-smokers from tobacco smoke.25. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped\n                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be\n                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to\n                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and\n                            climates. Ventilation systems shall be in operation at all times when\n                            fishers are on board.Heating and air conditioning26. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately heated, taking\n                            into account climatic conditions.27. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, adequate\n                            heat shall be provided, through an appropriate heating system, except in\n                            fishing vessels operating exclusively in tropical climates. The system\n                            of heating shall provide heat in all conditions, as necessary, and shall\n                            be in operation when fishers are living or working on board, and when\n                            conditions so require.28. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, with the\n                            exception of those regularly engaged in areas where temperate climatic\n                            conditions do not require it, air conditioning shall be provided in\n                            accommodation spaces, the bridge, the radio room and any centralized\n                            machinery control room.Lighting29. All accommodation spaces shall be provided with adequate\n                            light.30. Wherever practicable, accommodation spaces shall be lit\n                            with natural light in addition to artificial light. Where sleeping\n                            spaces have natural light, a means of blocking the light shall be\n                            provided.31. Adequate reading light shall be provided for every berth\n                            in addition to the normal lighting of the sleeping room.32. Emergency lighting shall be provided in sleeping\n                            rooms.33. Where a vessel is not fitted with emergency lighting in\n                            mess rooms, passageways, and any other spaces that are or may be used\n                            for emergency escape, permanent night lighting shall be provided in such\n                            spaces.34. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, lighting in\n                            accommodation spaces shall meet a standard established by the competent\n                            authority. In any part of the accommodation space available for free\n                            movement, the minimum standard for such lighting shall be such as to\n                            permit a person with normal vision to read an ordinary printed newspaper\n                            on a clear day.Sleeping roomsGeneral35. Where the design, dimensions or purpose of the vessel\n                            allow, the sleeping accommodation shall be located so as to minimize the\n                            effects of motion and acceleration but shall in no case be located\n                            forward of the collision bulkhead.Floor area36. The number of persons per sleeping room and the floor\n                            area per person, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall\n                            be such as to provide adequate space and comfort for the fishers on\n                            board, taking into account the service of the vessel.37. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over but which are\n                            less than 45 metres in length, the floor area per person of sleeping\n                            rooms, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less\n                            than 1.5 square metres.38. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, the floor\n                            area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space occupied by berths\n                            and lockers, shall not be less than 2 square metres.39. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,\n                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space\n                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5\n                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied\n                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Persons per sleeping room40. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, the\n                            number of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more\n                            than six.41. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the number\n                            of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more than\n                            four. The competent authority may permit exceptions to this requirement\n                            in particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirement unreasonable or impracticable.42. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, a\n                            separate sleeping room or sleeping rooms shall be provided for officers,\n                            wherever practicable.43. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping\n                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no\n                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. The competent\n                            authority may permit exceptions to the requirements of this paragraph in\n                            particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirements unreasonable or impracticable.Other44. The maximum number of persons to be accommodated in any\n                            sleeping room shall be legibly and indelibly marked in a place in the\n                            room where it can be conveniently seen.45. Individual berths of appropriate dimensions shall be\n                            provided. Mattresses shall be of a suitable material.46. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            inside dimensions of the berths shall not be less than 198 by 80\n                            centimetres.47.

The engagement of fishers under the age of 18 for work\n                                at night shall be prohibited. For the purpose of this Article,\n                                \"night\" shall be defined in accordance with national law and\n                                practice. It shall cover a period of at least nine hours starting no\n                                later than midnight and ending no earlier than 5 a.m. An exception\n                                to strict compliance with the night work restriction may be made by\n                                the competent authority when: (a) the effective training of the fishers concerned, in\n                                        accordance with established programmes and schedules, would\n                                        be impaired; or(b) the specific nature of the duty or a recognized training\n                                        programme requires that fishers covered by the exception\n                                        perform duties at night and the authority determines, after\n                                        consultation, that the work will not have a detrimental\n                                        impact on their health or well-being.7. Nothing in this Article shall affect any obligations\n                                assumed by the Member arising from the ratification of any other\n                                international labour Convention.Medical examinationArticle 101.

The competent authority, after consultation, may grant\n                                exemptions from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article,\n                                taking into account the safety and health of fishers, size of the\n                                vessel, availability of medical assistance and evacuation, duration\n                                of the voyage, area of operation, and type of fishing\n                                operation.3. The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not\n                                apply to a fisher working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length\n                                and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n                                In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisher to work\n                                on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration\n                                until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the\n                                fisher is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a\n                                recent date.Article 11Each Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing\n                            for:(a) the nature of medical examinations;(b) the form and content of medical certificates;(c) the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical\n                                practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning\n                                eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as\n                                qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy\n                                full independence in exercising their professional judgement;(d) the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity\n                                of medical certificates;(e) the right to a further examination by a second independent\n                                medical practitioner in the event that a person has been refused a\n                                certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may\n                                perform; and(f) other relevant requirements.Article 12In addition to the requirements set out in Article 10 and Article 11, on\n                            a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which\n                            normally remains at sea for more than three days:1. The medical certificate of a fisher shall state, at a\n                                minimum, that: (a) the hearing and sight of the fisher concerned are\n                                        satisfactory for the fisher's duties on the vessel; and(b) the fisher is not suffering from any medical condition\n                                        likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the\n                                        fisher unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or\n                                        health of other persons on board.2. The medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum\n                                period of two years unless the fisher is under the age of 18, in\n                                which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year.3. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in\n                                the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until\n                                the end of that voyage.Part IV.

Minimum hours of rest shall\n                                        not be less than: (i) ten hours in any 24-hour period; and(ii) 77 hours in any seven-day period.2. The competent authority may permit, for limited and\n                                specified reasons, temporary exceptions to the limits established in\n                                paragraph 1(b) of this Article. However, in such circumstances, it\n                                shall require that fishers shall receive compensatory periods of\n                                rest as soon as practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may\n                                establish alternative requirements to those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\n                                this Article. However, such alternative requirements shall be\n                                substantially equivalent and shall not jeopardize the safety and\n                                health of the fishers.4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the\n                                right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisher to perform any\n                                hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the\n                                persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving\n                                assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea.\n                                Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest\n                                and require a fisher to perform any hours of work necessary until\n                                the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after\n                                the normal situation has been restored, the skipper shall ensure\n                                that any fishers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period\n                                are provided with an adequate period of rest.Crew listArticle 15Every fishing vessel shall carry a crew list, a copy of which shall be\n                            provided to authorized persons ashore prior to departure of the vessel,\n                            or communicated ashore immediately after departure of the vessel.

National laws or regulations may permit the exclusion of the\n                            liability of the fishing vessel owner if the injury occurred otherwise\n                            than in the service of the vessel or the sickness or infirmity was\n                            concealed during engagement, or the injury or sickness was due to wilful\n                            misconduct of the fisher.Part VII. Compliance and enforcementArticle 40Each Member shall effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control over\n                        vessels that fly its flag by establishing a system for ensuring compliance\n                        with the requirements of this Convention including, as appropriate,\n                        inspections, reporting, monitoring, complaint procedures, appropriate\n                        penalties and corrective measures, in accordance with national laws or\n                        regulations.Article 411.

The period of validity of such document may coincide with\n                            the period of validity of a national or an international fishing vessel\n                            safety certificate, but in no case shall such period of validity exceed\n                            five years.Article 421.

If a Member, in whose port a fishing vessel calls in the\n                            normal course of its business or for operational reasons, receives a\n                            complaint or obtains evidence that such vessel does not conform to the\n                            requirements of this Convention, it may prepare a report addressed to\n                            the government of the flag State of the vessel, with a copy to the\n                            Director-General of the International Labour Office, and may take\n                            measures necessary to rectify any conditions on board which are clearly\n                            hazardous to safety or health.3. In taking the measures referred to in paragraph 2 of this\n                            Article, the Member shall notify forthwith the nearest representative of\n                            the flag State and, if possible, shall have such representative present.\n                            The Member shall not unreasonably detain or delay the vessel.4.

The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4. Any variations made by a Member under paragraph 3 of this\n                            Annex shall be reported to the International Labour Office under article\n                            22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.5. The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.Insulation18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.Other19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20. Emergency escapes from all crew accommodation spaces\n                            shall be provided as necessary.Noise and vibration21. The competent authority shall take measures to limit\n                            excessive noise and vibration in accommodation spaces and, as far as\n                            practicable, in accordance with relevant international standards.22. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the\n                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in\n                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers\n                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of\n                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Accommodation spaces shall be ventilated, taking into\n                            account climatic conditions. The system of ventilation shall supply air\n                            in a satisfactory condition whenever fishers are on board.24. Ventilation arrangements or other measures shall be such\n                            as to protect non-smokers from tobacco smoke.25. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped\n                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be\n                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to\n                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and\n                            climates. Ventilation systems shall be in operation at all times when\n                            fishers are on board.Heating and air conditioning26. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately heated, taking\n                            into account climatic conditions.27. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, adequate\n                            heat shall be provided, through an appropriate heating system, except in\n                            fishing vessels operating exclusively in tropical climates. The system\n                            of heating shall provide heat in all conditions, as necessary, and shall\n                            be in operation when fishers are living or working on board, and when\n                            conditions so require.28. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, with the\n                            exception of those regularly engaged in areas where temperate climatic\n                            conditions do not require it, air conditioning shall be provided in\n                            accommodation spaces, the bridge, the radio room and any centralized\n                            machinery control room.Lighting29. All accommodation spaces shall be provided with adequate\n                            light.30. Wherever practicable, accommodation spaces shall be lit\n                            with natural light in addition to artificial light. Where sleeping\n                            spaces have natural light, a means of blocking the light shall be\n                            provided.31. Adequate reading light shall be provided for every berth\n                            in addition to the normal lighting of the sleeping room.32. Emergency lighting shall be provided in sleeping\n                            rooms.33. Where a vessel is not fitted with emergency lighting in\n                            mess rooms, passageways, and any other spaces that are or may be used\n                            for emergency escape, permanent night lighting shall be provided in such\n                            spaces.34. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, lighting in\n                            accommodation spaces shall meet a standard established by the competent\n                            authority. In any part of the accommodation space available for free\n                            movement, the minimum standard for such lighting shall be such as to\n                            permit a person with normal vision to read an ordinary printed newspaper\n                            on a clear day.Sleeping roomsGeneral35. Where the design, dimensions or purpose of the vessel\n                            allow, the sleeping accommodation shall be located so as to minimize the\n                            effects of motion and acceleration but shall in no case be located\n                            forward of the collision bulkhead.Floor area36. The number of persons per sleeping room and the floor\n                            area per person, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall\n                            be such as to provide adequate space and comfort for the fishers on\n                            board, taking into account the service of the vessel.37. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over but which are\n                            less than 45 metres in length, the floor area per person of sleeping\n                            rooms, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less\n                            than 1.5 square metres.38. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, the floor\n                            area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space occupied by berths\n                            and lockers, shall not be less than 2 square metres.39. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,\n                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space\n                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5\n                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied\n                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Persons per sleeping room40. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, the\n                            number of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more\n                            than six.41. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the number\n                            of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more than\n                            four. The competent authority may permit exceptions to this requirement\n                            in particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirement unreasonable or impracticable.42. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, a\n                            separate sleeping room or sleeping rooms shall be provided for officers,\n                            wherever practicable.43. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping\n                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no\n                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. The competent\n                            authority may permit exceptions to the requirements of this paragraph in\n                            particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirements unreasonable or impracticable.Other44. The maximum number of persons to be accommodated in any\n                            sleeping room shall be legibly and indelibly marked in a place in the\n                            room where it can be conveniently seen.45. Individual berths of appropriate dimensions shall be\n                            provided. Mattresses shall be of a suitable material.46. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            inside dimensions of the berths shall not be less than 198 by 80\n                            centimetres.47. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 46, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            inside dimensions of the berths shall not be less than 190 by 70\n                            centimetres, where it is satisfied that this is reasonable and will not\n                            result in discomfort to the fishers.48. Sleeping rooms shall be so planned and equipped as to\n                            ensure reasonable comfort for the occupants and to facilitate tidiness.\n                            Equipment provided shall include berths, individual lockers sufficient\n                            for clothing and other personal effects, and a suitable writing\n                            surface.49. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, a desk\n                            suitable for writing, with a chair, shall be provided.50. Sleeping accommodation shall be situated or equipped, as\n                            practicable, so as to provide appropriate levels of privacy for men and\n                            for women.Mess rooms51. Mess rooms shall be as close as possible to the galley,\n                            but in no case shall be located forward of the collision bulkhead.52. Vessels shall be provided with mess-room accommodation\n                            suitable for their service. To the extent not expressly provided\n                            otherwise, mess-room accommodation shall be separate from sleeping\n                            quarters, where practicable.53. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, mess-room\n                            accommodation shall be separate from sleeping quarters.54. The dimensions and equipment of each mess room shall be\n                            sufficient for the number of persons likely to use it at any one\n                            time.55.

The engagement of fishers under the age of 18 for work\n                                at night shall be prohibited. For the purpose of this Article,\n                                \"night\" shall be defined in accordance with national law and\n                                practice.

The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not\n                                apply to a fisher working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length\n                                and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n                                In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisher to work\n                                on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration\n                                until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the\n                                fisher is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a\n                                recent date.Article 11Each Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing\n                            for:(a) the nature of medical examinations;(b) the form and content of medical certificates;(c) the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical\n                                practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning\n                                eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as\n                                qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy\n                                full independence in exercising their professional judgement;(d) the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity\n                                of medical certificates;(e) the right to a further examination by a second independent\n                                medical practitioner in the event that a person has been refused a\n                                certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may\n                                perform; and(f) other relevant requirements.Article 12In addition to the requirements set out in Article 10 and Article 11, on\n                            a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which\n                            normally remains at sea for more than three days:1. The medical certificate of a fisher shall state, at a\n                                minimum, that: (a) the hearing and sight of the fisher concerned are\n                                        satisfactory for the fisher's duties on the vessel; and(b) the fisher is not suffering from any medical condition\n                                        likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the\n                                        fisher unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or\n                                        health of other persons on board.2. The medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum\n                                period of two years unless the fisher is under the age of 18, in\n                                which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year.3. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in\n                                the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until\n                                the end of that voyage.Part IV.

However, in such circumstances, it\n                                shall require that fishers shall receive compensatory periods of\n                                rest as soon as practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may\n                                establish alternative requirements to those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\n                                this Article. However, such alternative requirements shall be\n                                substantially equivalent and shall not jeopardize the safety and\n                                health of the fishers.4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the\n                                right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisher to perform any\n                                hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the\n                                persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving\n                                assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea.\n                                Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest\n                                and require a fisher to perform any hours of work necessary until\n                                the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after\n                                the normal situation has been restored, the skipper shall ensure\n                                that any fishers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period\n                                are provided with an adequate period of rest.Crew listArticle 15Every fishing vessel shall carry a crew list, a copy of which shall be\n                            provided to authorized persons ashore prior to departure of the vessel,\n                            or communicated ashore immediately after departure of the vessel.

This also\n                                applies to fishers from that vessel who are transferred for the same\n                                reasons from the vessel to the foreign port.2. The cost of the repatriation referred to in paragraph 1\n                                of this Article shall be borne by the fishing vessel owner, except\n                                where the fisher has been found, in accordance with national laws,\n                                regulations or other measures, to be in serious default of his or\n                                her work agreement obligations.3.

Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17.

The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not\n                                apply to a fisher working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length\n                                and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n                                In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisher to work\n                                on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration\n                                until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the\n                                fisher is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a\n                                recent date.Article 11Each Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing\n                            for:(a) the nature of medical examinations;(b) the form and content of medical certificates;(c) the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical\n                                practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning\n                                eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as\n                                qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy\n                                full independence in exercising their professional judgement;(d) the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity\n                                of medical certificates;(e) the right to a further examination by a second independent\n                                medical practitioner in the event that a person has been refused a\n                                certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may\n                                perform; and(f) other relevant requirements.Article 12In addition to the requirements set out in Article 10 and Article 11, on\n                            a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which\n                            normally remains at sea for more than three days:1. The medical certificate of a fisher shall state, at a\n                                minimum, that: (a) the hearing and sight of the fisher concerned are\n                                        satisfactory for the fisher's duties on the vessel; and(b) the fisher is not suffering from any medical condition\n                                        likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the\n                                        fisher unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or\n                                        health of other persons on board.2. The medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum\n                                period of two years unless the fisher is under the age of 18, in\n                                which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year.3. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in\n                                the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until\n                                the end of that voyage.Part IV.

The competent authority, after consultation, may\n                                establish alternative requirements to those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\n                                this Article. However, such alternative requirements shall be\n                                substantially equivalent and shall not jeopardize the safety and\n                                health of the fishers.4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the\n                                right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisher to perform any\n                                hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the\n                                persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving\n                                assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea.\n                                Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest\n                                and require a fisher to perform any hours of work necessary until\n                                the normal situation has been restored.

The following shall apply to all new, decked fishing\n                            vessels, subject to any exclusions provided for in accordance with\n                            Article 3 of the Convention. The competent authority may, after\n                            consultation, also apply the requirements of this Annex to existing\n                            vessels, when and in so far as it determines that this is reasonable and\n                            practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4.

The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.Insulation18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.Other19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20.

The engagement of fishers under the age of 18 for work\n                                at night shall be prohibited. For the purpose of this Article,\n                                \"night\" shall be defined in accordance with national law and\n                                practice. It shall cover a period of at least nine hours starting no\n                                later than midnight and ending no earlier than 5 a.m. An exception\n                                to strict compliance with the night work restriction may be made by\n                                the competent authority when: (a) the effective training of the fishers concerned, in\n                                        accordance with established programmes and schedules, would\n                                        be impaired; or(b) the specific nature of the duty or a recognized training\n                                        programme requires that fishers covered by the exception\n                                        perform duties at night and the authority determines, after\n                                        consultation, that the work will not have a detrimental\n                                        impact on their health or well-being.7. Nothing in this Article shall affect any obligations\n                                assumed by the Member arising from the ratification of any other\n                                international labour Convention.Medical examinationArticle 101.

The competent authority, after consultation, may grant\n                                exemptions from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article,\n                                taking into account the safety and health of fishers, size of the\n                                vessel, availability of medical assistance and evacuation, duration\n                                of the voyage, area of operation, and type of fishing\n                                operation.3. The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not\n                                apply to a fisher working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length\n                                and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n                                In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisher to work\n                                on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration\n                                until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the\n                                fisher is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a\n                                recent date.Article 11Each Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing\n                            for:(a) the nature of medical examinations;(b) the form and content of medical certificates;(c) the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical\n                                practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning\n                                eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as\n                                qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy\n                                full independence in exercising their professional judgement;(d) the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity\n                                of medical certificates;(e) the right to a further examination by a second independent\n                                medical practitioner in the event that a person has been refused a\n                                certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may\n                                perform; and(f) other relevant requirements.Article 12In addition to the requirements set out in Article 10 and Article 11, on\n                            a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which\n                            normally remains at sea for more than three days:1. The medical certificate of a fisher shall state, at a\n                                minimum, that: (a) the hearing and sight of the fisher concerned are\n                                        satisfactory for the fisher's duties on the vessel; and(b) the fisher is not suffering from any medical condition\n                                        likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the\n                                        fisher unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or\n                                        health of other persons on board.2. The medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum\n                                period of two years unless the fisher is under the age of 18, in\n                                which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year.3. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in\n                                the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until\n                                the end of that voyage.Part IV.

Minimum hours of rest shall\n                                        not be less than: (i) ten hours in any 24-hour period; and(ii) 77 hours in any seven-day period.2. The competent authority may permit, for limited and\n                                specified reasons, temporary exceptions to the limits established in\n                                paragraph 1(b) of this Article. However, in such circumstances, it\n                                shall require that fishers shall receive compensatory periods of\n                                rest as soon as practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may\n                                establish alternative requirements to those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\n                                this Article. However, such alternative requirements shall be\n                                substantially equivalent and shall not jeopardize the safety and\n                                health of the fishers.4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the\n                                right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisher to perform any\n                                hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the\n                                persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving\n                                assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea.\n                                Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest\n                                and require a fisher to perform any hours of work necessary until\n                                the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after\n                                the normal situation has been restored, the skipper shall ensure\n                                that any fishers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period\n                                are provided with an adequate period of rest.Crew listArticle 15Every fishing vessel shall carry a crew list, a copy of which shall be\n                            provided to authorized persons ashore prior to departure of the vessel,\n                            or communicated ashore immediately after departure of the vessel.

The following shall apply to all new, decked fishing\n                            vessels, subject to any exclusions provided for in accordance with\n                            Article 3 of the Convention. The competent authority may, after\n                            consultation, also apply the requirements of this Annex to existing\n                            vessels, when and in so far as it determines that this is reasonable and\n                            practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4.

The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.Insulation18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.Other19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20. Emergency escapes from all crew accommodation spaces\n                            shall be provided as necessary.Noise and vibration21. The competent authority shall take measures to limit\n                            excessive noise and vibration in accommodation spaces and, as far as\n                            practicable, in accordance with relevant international standards.22. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the\n                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in\n                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers\n                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of\n                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Accommodation spaces shall be ventilated, taking into\n                            account climatic conditions. The system of ventilation shall supply air\n                            in a satisfactory condition whenever fishers are on board.24. Ventilation arrangements or other measures shall be such\n                            as to protect non-smokers from tobacco smoke.25. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped\n                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be\n                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to\n                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and\n                            climates. Ventilation systems shall be in operation at all times when\n                            fishers are on board.Heating and air conditioning26. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately heated, taking\n                            into account climatic conditions.27.

The engagement of fishers under the age of 18 for work\n                                at night shall be prohibited. For the purpose of this Article,\n                                \"night\" shall be defined in accordance with national law and\n                                practice. It shall cover a period of at least nine hours starting no\n                                later than midnight and ending no earlier than 5 a.m. An exception\n                                to strict compliance with the night work restriction may be made by\n                                the competent authority when: (a) the effective training of the fishers concerned, in\n                                        accordance with established programmes and schedules, would\n                                        be impaired; or(b) the specific nature of the duty or a recognized training\n                                        programme requires that fishers covered by the exception\n                                        perform duties at night and the authority determines, after\n                                        consultation, that the work will not have a detrimental\n                                        impact on their health or well-being.7. Nothing in this Article shall affect any obligations\n                                assumed by the Member arising from the ratification of any other\n                                international labour Convention.Medical examinationArticle 101.

The competent authority, after consultation, may grant\n                                exemptions from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article,\n                                taking into account the safety and health of fishers, size of the\n                                vessel, availability of medical assistance and evacuation, duration\n                                of the voyage, area of operation, and type of fishing\n                                operation.3. The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not\n                                apply to a fisher working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length\n                                and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n                                In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisher to work\n                                on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration\n                                until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the\n                                fisher is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a\n                                recent date.Article 11Each Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing\n                            for:(a) the nature of medical examinations;(b) the form and content of medical certificates;(c) the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical\n                                practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning\n                                eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as\n                                qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy\n                                full independence in exercising their professional judgement;(d) the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity\n                                of medical certificates;(e) the right to a further examination by a second independent\n                                medical practitioner in the event that a person has been refused a\n                                certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may\n                                perform; and(f) other relevant requirements.Article 12In addition to the requirements set out in Article 10 and Article 11, on\n                            a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which\n                            normally remains at sea for more than three days:1. The medical certificate of a fisher shall state, at a\n                                minimum, that: (a) the hearing and sight of the fisher concerned are\n                                        satisfactory for the fisher's duties on the vessel; and(b) the fisher is not suffering from any medical condition\n                                        likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the\n                                        fisher unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or\n                                        health of other persons on board.2. The medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum\n                                period of two years unless the fisher is under the age of 18, in\n                                which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year.3. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in\n                                the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until\n                                the end of that voyage.Part IV.

Minimum hours of rest shall\n                                        not be less than: (i) ten hours in any 24-hour period; and(ii) 77 hours in any seven-day period.2. The competent authority may permit, for limited and\n                                specified reasons, temporary exceptions to the limits established in\n                                paragraph 1(b) of this Article. However, in such circumstances, it\n                                shall require that fishers shall receive compensatory periods of\n                                rest as soon as practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may\n                                establish alternative requirements to those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\n                                this Article. However, such alternative requirements shall be\n                                substantially equivalent and shall not jeopardize the safety and\n                                health of the fishers.4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the\n                                right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisher to perform any\n                                hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the\n                                persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving\n                                assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea.\n                                Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest\n                                and require a fisher to perform any hours of work necessary until\n                                the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after\n                                the normal situation has been restored, the skipper shall ensure\n                                that any fishers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period\n                                are provided with an adequate period of rest.Crew listArticle 15Every fishing vessel shall carry a crew list, a copy of which shall be\n                            provided to authorized persons ashore prior to departure of the vessel,\n                            or communicated ashore immediately after departure of the vessel.

The following shall apply to all new, decked fishing\n                            vessels, subject to any exclusions provided for in accordance with\n                            Article 3 of the Convention. The competent authority may, after\n                            consultation, also apply the requirements of this Annex to existing\n                            vessels, when and in so far as it determines that this is reasonable and\n                            practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4.

The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.Insulation18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.Other19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20. Emergency escapes from all crew accommodation spaces\n                            shall be provided as necessary.Noise and vibration21. The competent authority shall take measures to limit\n                            excessive noise and vibration in accommodation spaces and, as far as\n                            practicable, in accordance with relevant international standards.22. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the\n                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in\n                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers\n                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of\n                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Accommodation spaces shall be ventilated, taking into\n                            account climatic conditions. The system of ventilation shall supply air\n                            in a satisfactory condition whenever fishers are on board.24. Ventilation arrangements or other measures shall be such\n                            as to protect non-smokers from tobacco smoke.25. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped\n                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be\n                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to\n                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and\n                            climates. Ventilation systems shall be in operation at all times when\n                            fishers are on board.Heating and air conditioning26. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately heated, taking\n                            into account climatic conditions.27.

The engagement of fishers under the age of 18 for work\n                                at night shall be prohibited. For the purpose of this Article,\n                                \"night\" shall be defined in accordance with national law and\n                                practice. It shall cover a period of at least nine hours starting no\n                                later than midnight and ending no earlier than 5 a.m. An exception\n                                to strict compliance with the night work restriction may be made by\n                                the competent authority when: (a) the effective training of the fishers concerned, in\n                                        accordance with established programmes and schedules, would\n                                        be impaired; or(b) the specific nature of the duty or a recognized training\n                                        programme requires that fishers covered by the exception\n                                        perform duties at night and the authority determines, after\n                                        consultation, that the work will not have a detrimental\n                                        impact on their health or well-being.7. Nothing in this Article shall affect any obligations\n                                assumed by the Member arising from the ratification of any other\n                                international labour Convention.Medical examinationArticle 101.

The competent authority, after consultation, may grant\n                                exemptions from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article,\n                                taking into account the safety and health of fishers, size of the\n                                vessel, availability of medical assistance and evacuation, duration\n                                of the voyage, area of operation, and type of fishing\n                                operation.3. The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not\n                                apply to a fisher working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length\n                                and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n                                In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisher to work\n                                on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration\n                                until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the\n                                fisher is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a\n                                recent date.Article 11Each Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing\n                            for:(a) the nature of medical examinations;(b) the form and content of medical certificates;(c) the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical\n                                practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning\n                                eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as\n                                qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy\n                                full independence in exercising their professional judgement;(d) the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity\n                                of medical certificates;(e) the right to a further examination by a second independent\n                                medical practitioner in the event that a person has been refused a\n                                certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may\n                                perform; and(f) other relevant requirements.Article 12In addition to the requirements set out in Article 10 and Article 11, on\n                            a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which\n                            normally remains at sea for more than three days:1. The medical certificate of a fisher shall state, at a\n                                minimum, that: (a) the hearing and sight of the fisher concerned are\n                                        satisfactory for the fisher's duties on the vessel; and(b) the fisher is not suffering from any medical condition\n                                        likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the\n                                        fisher unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or\n                                        health of other persons on board.2. The medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum\n                                period of two years unless the fisher is under the age of 18, in\n                                which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year.3. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in\n                                the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until\n                                the end of that voyage.Part IV.

Minimum hours of rest shall\n                                        not be less than: (i) ten hours in any 24-hour period; and(ii) 77 hours in any seven-day period.2. The competent authority may permit, for limited and\n                                specified reasons, temporary exceptions to the limits established in\n                                paragraph 1(b) of this Article. However, in such circumstances, it\n                                shall require that fishers shall receive compensatory periods of\n                                rest as soon as practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may\n                                establish alternative requirements to those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\n                                this Article. However, such alternative requirements shall be\n                                substantially equivalent and shall not jeopardize the safety and\n                                health of the fishers.4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the\n                                right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisher to perform any\n                                hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the\n                                persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving\n                                assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea.\n                                Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest\n                                and require a fisher to perform any hours of work necessary until\n                                the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after\n                                the normal situation has been restored, the skipper shall ensure\n                                that any fishers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period\n                                are provided with an adequate period of rest.Crew listArticle 15Every fishing vessel shall carry a crew list, a copy of which shall be\n                            provided to authorized persons ashore prior to departure of the vessel,\n                            or communicated ashore immediately after departure of the vessel.

The following shall apply to all new, decked fishing\n                            vessels, subject to any exclusions provided for in accordance with\n                            Article 3 of the Convention. The competent authority may, after\n                            consultation, also apply the requirements of this Annex to existing\n                            vessels, when and in so far as it determines that this is reasonable and\n                            practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4.

The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.Insulation18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.Other19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20. Emergency escapes from all crew accommodation spaces\n                            shall be provided as necessary.Noise and vibration21. The competent authority shall take measures to limit\n                            excessive noise and vibration in accommodation spaces and, as far as\n                            practicable, in accordance with relevant international standards.22. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the\n                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in\n                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers\n                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of\n                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Accommodation spaces shall be ventilated, taking into\n                            account climatic conditions. The system of ventilation shall supply air\n                            in a satisfactory condition whenever fishers are on board.24. Ventilation arrangements or other measures shall be such\n                            as to protect non-smokers from tobacco smoke.25. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped\n                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be\n                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to\n                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and\n                            climates. Ventilation systems shall be in operation at all times when\n                            fishers are on board.Heating and air conditioning26. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately heated, taking\n                            into account climatic conditions.27.

The engagement of fishers under the age of 18 for work\n                                at night shall be prohibited. For the purpose of this Article,\n                                \"night\" shall be defined in accordance with national law and\n                                practice. It shall cover a period of at least nine hours starting no\n                                later than midnight and ending no earlier than 5 a.m. An exception\n                                to strict compliance with the night work restriction may be made by\n                                the competent authority when: (a) the effective training of the fishers concerned, in\n                                        accordance with established programmes and schedules, would\n                                        be impaired; or(b) the specific nature of the duty or a recognized training\n                                        programme requires that fishers covered by the exception\n                                        perform duties at night and the authority determines, after\n                                        consultation, that the work will not have a detrimental\n                                        impact on their health or well-being.7. Nothing in this Article shall affect any obligations\n                                assumed by the Member arising from the ratification of any other\n                                international labour Convention.Medical examinationArticle 101.

The competent authority, after consultation, may grant\n                                exemptions from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article,\n                                taking into account the safety and health of fishers, size of the\n                                vessel, availability of medical assistance and evacuation, duration\n                                of the voyage, area of operation, and type of fishing\n                                operation.3. The exemptions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall not\n                                apply to a fisher working on a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length\n                                and over or which normally remains at sea for more than three days.\n                                In urgent cases, the competent authority may permit a fisher to work\n                                on such a vessel for a period of a limited and specified duration\n                                until a medical certificate can be obtained, provided that the\n                                fisher is in possession of an expired medical certificate of a\n                                recent date.Article 11Each Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures providing\n                            for:(a) the nature of medical examinations;(b) the form and content of medical certificates;(c) the issue of a medical certificate by a duly qualified medical\n                                practitioner or, in the case of a certificate solely concerning\n                                eyesight, by a person recognized by the competent authority as\n                                qualified to issue such a certificate; these persons shall enjoy\n                                full independence in exercising their professional judgement;(d) the frequency of medical examinations and the period of validity\n                                of medical certificates;(e) the right to a further examination by a second independent\n                                medical practitioner in the event that a person has been refused a\n                                certificate or has had limitations imposed on the work he or she may\n                                perform; and(f) other relevant requirements.Article 12In addition to the requirements set out in Article 10 and Article 11, on\n                            a fishing vessel of 24 metres in length and over, or on a vessel which\n                            normally remains at sea for more than three days:1. The medical certificate of a fisher shall state, at a\n                                minimum, that: (a) the hearing and sight of the fisher concerned are\n                                        satisfactory for the fisher's duties on the vessel; and(b) the fisher is not suffering from any medical condition\n                                        likely to be aggravated by service at sea or to render the\n                                        fisher unfit for such service or to endanger the safety or\n                                        health of other persons on board.2. The medical certificate shall be valid for a maximum\n                                period of two years unless the fisher is under the age of 18, in\n                                which case the maximum period of validity shall be one year.3. If the period of validity of a certificate expires in\n                                the course of a voyage, the certificate shall remain in force until\n                                the end of that voyage.Part IV.

However, in such circumstances, it\n                                shall require that fishers shall receive compensatory periods of\n                                rest as soon as practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may\n                                establish alternative requirements to those in paragraphs 1 and 2 of\n                                this Article. However, such alternative requirements shall be\n                                substantially equivalent and shall not jeopardize the safety and\n                                health of the fishers.4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the\n                                right of the skipper of a vessel to require a fisher to perform any\n                                hours of work necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel, the\n                                persons on board or the catch, or for the purpose of giving\n                                assistance to other boats or ships or persons in distress at sea.\n                                Accordingly, the skipper may suspend the schedule of hours of rest\n                                and require a fisher to perform any hours of work necessary until\n                                the normal situation has been restored. As soon as practicable after\n                                the normal situation has been restored, the skipper shall ensure\n                                that any fishers who have performed work in a scheduled rest period\n                                are provided with an adequate period of rest.Crew listArticle 15Every fishing vessel shall carry a crew list, a copy of which shall be\n                            provided to authorized persons ashore prior to departure of the vessel,\n                            or communicated ashore immediately after departure of the vessel.

The competent authority may, after\n                            consultation, also apply the requirements of this Annex to existing\n                            vessels, when and in so far as it determines that this is reasonable and\n                            practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4. Any variations made by a Member under paragraph 3 of this\n                            Annex shall be reported to the International Labour Office under article\n                            22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.5. The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.Insulation18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.Other19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20. Emergency escapes from all crew accommodation spaces\n                            shall be provided as necessary.Noise and vibration21. The competent authority shall take measures to limit\n                            excessive noise and vibration in accommodation spaces and, as far as\n                            practicable, in accordance with relevant international standards.22. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the\n                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in\n                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers\n                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of\n                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Accommodation spaces shall be ventilated, taking into\n                            account climatic conditions. The system of ventilation shall supply air\n                            in a satisfactory condition whenever fishers are on board.24. Ventilation arrangements or other measures shall be such\n                            as to protect non-smokers from tobacco smoke.25. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped\n                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be\n                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to\n                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and\n                            climates. Ventilation systems shall be in operation at all times when\n                            fishers are on board.Heating and air conditioning26. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately heated, taking\n                            into account climatic conditions.27. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, adequate\n                            heat shall be provided, through an appropriate heating system, except in\n                            fishing vessels operating exclusively in tropical climates. The system\n                            of heating shall provide heat in all conditions, as necessary, and shall\n                            be in operation when fishers are living or working on board, and when\n                            conditions so require.28. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, with the\n                            exception of those regularly engaged in areas where temperate climatic\n                            conditions do not require it, air conditioning shall be provided in\n                            accommodation spaces, the bridge, the radio room and any centralized\n                            machinery control room.Lighting29. All accommodation spaces shall be provided with adequate\n                            light.30. Wherever practicable, accommodation spaces shall be lit\n                            with natural light in addition to artificial light. Where sleeping\n                            spaces have natural light, a means of blocking the light shall be\n                            provided.31. Adequate reading light shall be provided for every berth\n                            in addition to the normal lighting of the sleeping room.32. Emergency lighting shall be provided in sleeping\n                            rooms.33. Where a vessel is not fitted with emergency lighting in\n                            mess rooms, passageways, and any other spaces that are or may be used\n                            for emergency escape, permanent night lighting shall be provided in such\n                            spaces.34. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, lighting in\n                            accommodation spaces shall meet a standard established by the competent\n                            authority. In any part of the accommodation space available for free\n                            movement, the minimum standard for such lighting shall be such as to\n                            permit a person with normal vision to read an ordinary printed newspaper\n                            on a clear day.Sleeping roomsGeneral35. Where the design, dimensions or purpose of the vessel\n                            allow, the sleeping accommodation shall be located so as to minimize the\n                            effects of motion and acceleration but shall in no case be located\n                            forward of the collision bulkhead.Floor area36. The number of persons per sleeping room and the floor\n                            area per person, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall\n                            be such as to provide adequate space and comfort for the fishers on\n                            board, taking into account the service of the vessel.37. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over but which are\n                            less than 45 metres in length, the floor area per person of sleeping\n                            rooms, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less\n                            than 1.5 square metres.38. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, the floor\n                            area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space occupied by berths\n                            and lockers, shall not be less than 2 square metres.39. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,\n                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space\n                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5\n                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied\n                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Persons per sleeping room40. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, the\n                            number of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more\n                            than six.41. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the number\n                            of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more than\n                            four. The competent authority may permit exceptions to this requirement\n                            in particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirement unreasonable or impracticable.42. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, a\n                            separate sleeping room or sleeping rooms shall be provided for officers,\n                            wherever practicable.43. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping\n                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no\n                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. The competent\n                            authority may permit exceptions to the requirements of this paragraph in\n                            particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirements unreasonable or impracticable.Other44. The maximum number of persons to be accommodated in any\n                            sleeping room shall be legibly and indelibly marked in a place in the\n                            room where it can be conveniently seen.45. Individual berths of appropriate dimensions shall be\n                            provided. Mattresses shall be of a suitable material.46. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            inside dimensions of the berths shall not be less than 198 by 80\n                            centimetres.47.

For the purposes of this Annex: (a) \"new fishing vessel\" means a vessel for which: (i) the building or major conversion contract has been\n                                            placed on or after the date of the entry into force of\n                                            the Convention for the Member concerned; or(ii) the building or major conversion contract has been\n                                            placed before the date of the entry into force of the\n                                            Convention for the Member concerned, and which is\n                                            delivered three years or more after that date; or(iii) in the absence of a building contract, on or after\n                                            the date of the entry into force of the Convention for\n                                            the Member concerned: - the keel is laid, or- construction identifiable with a specific\n                                                  vessel begins, or- assembly has commenced comprising at least 50\n                                                  tonnes or 1 per cent of the estimated mass of all\n                                                  structural material, whichever is less;(b) \"existing vessel\" means a vessel that is not a new fishing\n                                    vessel.2. The following shall apply to all new, decked fishing\n                            vessels, subject to any exclusions provided for in accordance with\n                            Article 3 of the Convention. The competent authority may, after\n                            consultation, also apply the requirements of this Annex to existing\n                            vessels, when and in so far as it determines that this is reasonable and\n                            practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4. Any variations made by a Member under paragraph 3 of this\n                            Annex shall be reported to the International Labour Office under article\n                            22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.5. The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.Planning and control9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.Design and constructionHeadroom13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Openings into and between accommodation spaces16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.Insulation18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.Other19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20. Emergency escapes from all crew accommodation spaces\n                            shall be provided as necessary.Noise and vibration21. The competent authority shall take measures to limit\n                            excessive noise and vibration in accommodation spaces and, as far as\n                            practicable, in accordance with relevant international standards.22. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the\n                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in\n                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers\n                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of\n                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Accommodation spaces shall be ventilated, taking into\n                            account climatic conditions. The system of ventilation shall supply air\n                            in a satisfactory condition whenever fishers are on board.24. Ventilation arrangements or other measures shall be such\n                            as to protect non-smokers from tobacco smoke.25. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped\n                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be\n                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to\n                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and\n                            climates. Ventilation systems shall be in operation at all times when\n                            fishers are on board.Heating and air conditioning26. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately heated, taking\n                            into account climatic conditions.27. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, adequate\n                            heat shall be provided, through an appropriate heating system, except in\n                            fishing vessels operating exclusively in tropical climates. The system\n                            of heating shall provide heat in all conditions, as necessary, and shall\n                            be in operation when fishers are living or working on board, and when\n                            conditions so require.28. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, with the\n                            exception of those regularly engaged in areas where temperate climatic\n                            conditions do not require it, air conditioning shall be provided in\n                            accommodation spaces, the bridge, the radio room and any centralized\n                            machinery control room.Lighting29. All accommodation spaces shall be provided with adequate\n                            light.30. Wherever practicable, accommodation spaces shall be lit\n                            with natural light in addition to artificial light. Where sleeping\n                            spaces have natural light, a means of blocking the light shall be\n                            provided.31. Adequate reading light shall be provided for every berth\n                            in addition to the normal lighting of the sleeping room.32. Emergency lighting shall be provided in sleeping\n                            rooms.33. Where a vessel is not fitted with emergency lighting in\n                            mess rooms, passageways, and any other spaces that are or may be used\n                            for emergency escape, permanent night lighting shall be provided in such\n                            spaces.34. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, lighting in\n                            accommodation spaces shall meet a standard established by the competent\n                            authority. In any part of the accommodation space available for free\n                            movement, the minimum standard for such lighting shall be such as to\n                            permit a person with normal vision to read an ordinary printed newspaper\n                            on a clear day.Sleeping roomsGeneral35. Where the design, dimensions or purpose of the vessel\n                            allow, the sleeping accommodation shall be located so as to minimize the\n                            effects of motion and acceleration but shall in no case be located\n                            forward of the collision bulkhead.Floor area36. The number of persons per sleeping room and the floor\n                            area per person, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall\n                            be such as to provide adequate space and comfort for the fishers on\n                            board, taking into account the service of the vessel.37. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over but which are\n                            less than 45 metres in length, the floor area per person of sleeping\n                            rooms, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less\n                            than 1.5 square metres.38. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, the floor\n                            area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space occupied by berths\n                            and lockers, shall not be less than 2 square metres.39. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,\n                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space\n                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5\n                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied\n                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.Persons per sleeping room40. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, the\n                            number of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more\n                            than six.41. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the number\n                            of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more than\n                            four. The competent authority may permit exceptions to this requirement\n                            in particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirement unreasonable or impracticable.42. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, a\n                            separate sleeping room or sleeping rooms shall be provided for officers,\n                            wherever practicable.43. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping\n                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no\n                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. The competent\n                            authority may permit exceptions to the requirements of this paragraph in\n                            particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirements unreasonable or impracticable.Other44. The maximum number of persons to be accommodated in any\n                            sleeping room shall be legibly and indelibly marked in a place in the\n                            room where it can be conveniently seen.45.

The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            derogations from the provisions in this Annex to take into account,\n                            without discrimination, the interests of fishers having differing and\n                            distinctive religious and social practices, on condition that such\n                            derogations do not result in overall conditions less favourable than\n                            those which would result from the application of this Annex.\n\n1. For the purposes of this Annex: (a) \"new fishing vessel\" means a vessel for which: (i) the building or major conversion contract has been\n                                            placed on or after the date of the entry into force of\n                                            the Convention for the Member concerned; or(ii) the building or major conversion contract has been\n                                            placed before the date of the entry into force of the\n                                            Convention for the Member concerned, and which is\n                                            delivered three years or more after that date; or(iii) in the absence of a building contract, on or after\n                                            the date of the entry into force of the Convention for\n                                            the Member concerned: - the keel is laid, or- construction identifiable with a specific\n                                                  vessel begins, or- assembly has commenced comprising at least 50\n                                                  tonnes or 1 per cent of the estimated mass of all\n                                                  structural material, whichever is less;(b) \"existing vessel\" means a vessel that is not a new fishing\n                                    vessel.2. The following shall apply to all new, decked fishing\n                            vessels, subject to any exclusions provided for in accordance with\n                            Article 3 of the Convention. The competent authority may, after\n                            consultation, also apply the requirements of this Annex to existing\n                            vessels, when and in so far as it determines that this is reasonable and\n                            practicable.3. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit\n                            variations to the provisions of this Annex for fishing vessels normally\n                            remaining at sea for less than 24 hours where the fishers do not live on\n                            board the vessel in port. In the case of such vessels, the competent\n                            authority shall ensure that the fishers concerned have adequate\n                            facilities for resting, eating and sanitation purposes.4. Any variations made by a Member under paragraph 3 of this\n                            Annex shall be reported to the International Labour Office under article\n                            22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.5. The requirements for vessels of 24 metres in length and\n                            over may be applied to vessels between 15 and 24 metres in length where\n                            the competent authority determines, after consultation, that this is\n                            reasonable and practicable.6. Fishers working on board feeder vessels which do not have\n                            appropriate accommodation and sanitary facilities shall be provided with\n                            such accommodation and facilities on board the mother vessel.7. Members may extend the requirements of this Annex regarding\n                            noise and vibration, ventilation, heating and air conditioning, and\n                            lighting to enclosed working spaces and spaces used for storage if,\n                            after consultation, such application is considered appropriate and will\n                            not have a negative influence on the function of the process or working\n                            conditions or the quality of the catches.8. The use of gross tonnage as referred to in Article 5 of the\n                            Convention is limited to the following specified paragraphs of this\n                            Annex: 14, 37, 38, 41, 43, 46, 49, 53, 55, 61, 64, 65 and 67. For these\n                            purposes, where the competent authority, after consultation, decides to\n                            use gross tonnage (gt) as the basis of measurement: (a) a gross tonnage of 75 gt shall be considered equivalent to a\n                                    length (L) of 15 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 16.5\n                                    metres;(b) a gross tonnage of 300 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 24 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 26.5\n                                    metres;(c) a gross tonnage of 950 gt shall be considered equivalent to\n                                    a length (L) of 45 metres or a length overall (LOA) of 50\n                                    metres.\n\n9. The competent authority shall satisfy itself that, on every\n                            occasion when a vessel is newly constructed or the crew accommodation of\n                            a vessel has been reconstructed, such vessel complies with the\n                            requirements of this Annex. The competent authority shall, to the extent\n                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew\n                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel\n                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require\n                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in\n                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For the occasions noted in paragraph 9 of this Annex, for\n                            vessels of 24 metres in length and over, detailed plans and information\n                            concerning accommodation shall be required to be submitted for approval\n                            to the competent authority, or an entity authorized by it.11. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every\n                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been\n                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall\n                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the\n                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of\n                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that\n                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. The\n                            competent authority may carry out additional inspections of crew\n                            accommodation at its discretion.12. When a vessel changes flag, any alternative requirements\n                            which the competent authority of the Member whose flag the ship was\n                            formerly flying may have adopted in accordance with paragraphs 15, 39,\n                            47 or 62 of this Annex cease to apply to the vessel.\n\nHeadroom\n\n13. There shall be adequate headroom in all accommodation\n                            spaces. For spaces where fishers are expected to stand for prolonged\n                            periods, the minimum headroom shall be prescribed by the competent\n                            authority.14. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            permitted headroom in all accommodation where full and free movement is\n                            necessary shall not be less than 200 centimetres.15. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 14, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted headroom shall not be less than 190 centimetres in any space -\n                            or part of any space - in such accommodation, where it is satisfied that\n                            this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.\n\nOpenings into and between accommodation spaces\n\n16. There shall be no direct openings into sleeping rooms\n                            from fish rooms and machinery spaces, except for the purpose of\n                            emergency escape. Where reasonable and practicable, direct openings from\n                            galleys, storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas shall be\n                            avoided unless expressly provided otherwise.17. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into\n                            sleeping rooms from fish rooms and machinery spaces or from galleys,\n                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the\n                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external\n                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved\n                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. This provision does not\n                            exclude the possibility of sanitary areas being shared between two\n                            cabins.\n\nInsulation\n\n18. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately insulated; the\n                            materials used to construct internal bulkheads, panelling and sheeting,\n                            and floors and joinings shall be suitable for the purpose and shall be\n                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. Sufficient drainage shall\n                            be provided in all accommodation spaces.\n\nOther\n\n19. All practicable measures shall be taken to protect\n                            fishing vessels' crew accommodation against flies and other insects,\n                            particularly when vessels are operating in mosquito-infested areas.20. Emergency escapes from all crew accommodation spaces\n                            shall be provided as necessary.\n\n21. The competent authority shall take measures to limit\n                            excessive noise and vibration in accommodation spaces and, as far as\n                            practicable, in accordance with relevant international standards.22. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the\n                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in\n                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers\n                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of\n                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.\n\n23. Accommodation spaces shall be ventilated, taking into\n                            account climatic conditions. The system of ventilation shall supply air\n                            in a satisfactory condition whenever fishers are on board.24. Ventilation arrangements or other measures shall be such\n                            as to protect non-smokers from tobacco smoke.25. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped\n                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be\n                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to\n                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and\n                            climates. Ventilation systems shall be in operation at all times when\n                            fishers are on board.\n\n26. Accommodation spaces shall be adequately heated, taking\n                            into account climatic conditions.27. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, adequate\n                            heat shall be provided, through an appropriate heating system, except in\n                            fishing vessels operating exclusively in tropical climates. The system\n                            of heating shall provide heat in all conditions, as necessary, and shall\n                            be in operation when fishers are living or working on board, and when\n                            conditions so require.28. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, with the\n                            exception of those regularly engaged in areas where temperate climatic\n                            conditions do not require it, air conditioning shall be provided in\n                            accommodation spaces, the bridge, the radio room and any centralized\n                            machinery control room.\n\n29. All accommodation spaces shall be provided with adequate\n                            light.30. Wherever practicable, accommodation spaces shall be lit\n                            with natural light in addition to artificial light. Where sleeping\n                            spaces have natural light, a means of blocking the light shall be\n                            provided.31. Adequate reading light shall be provided for every berth\n                            in addition to the normal lighting of the sleeping room.32. Emergency lighting shall be provided in sleeping\n                            rooms.33. Where a vessel is not fitted with emergency lighting in\n                            mess rooms, passageways, and any other spaces that are or may be used\n                            for emergency escape, permanent night lighting shall be provided in such\n                            spaces.34. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, lighting in\n                            accommodation spaces shall meet a standard established by the competent\n                            authority. In any part of the accommodation space available for free\n                            movement, the minimum standard for such lighting shall be such as to\n                            permit a person with normal vision to read an ordinary printed newspaper\n                            on a clear day.\n\nGeneral\n\n35. Where the design, dimensions or purpose of the vessel\n                            allow, the sleeping accommodation shall be located so as to minimize the\n                            effects of motion and acceleration but shall in no case be located\n                            forward of the collision bulkhead.\n\nFloor area\n\n36. The number of persons per sleeping room and the floor\n                            area per person, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall\n                            be such as to provide adequate space and comfort for the fishers on\n                            board, taking into account the service of the vessel.37. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over but which are\n                            less than 45 metres in length, the floor area per person of sleeping\n                            rooms, excluding space occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less\n                            than 1.5 square metres.38. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, the floor\n                            area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space occupied by berths\n                            and lockers, shall not be less than 2 square metres.39. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,\n                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space\n                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5\n                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied\n                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the\n                            fishers.\n\nPersons per sleeping room\n\n40. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, the\n                            number of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more\n                            than six.41. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the number\n                            of persons allowed to occupy each sleeping room shall not be more than\n                            four. The competent authority may permit exceptions to this requirement\n                            in particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirement unreasonable or impracticable.42. To the extent not expressly provided otherwise, a\n                            separate sleeping room or sleeping rooms shall be provided for officers,\n                            wherever practicable.43. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping\n                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no\n                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. The competent\n                            authority may permit exceptions to the requirements of this paragraph in\n                            particular cases if the size, type or intended service of the vessel\n                            makes the requirements unreasonable or impracticable.\n\nOther\n\n44. The maximum number of persons to be accommodated in any\n                            sleeping room shall be legibly and indelibly marked in a place in the\n                            room where it can be conveniently seen.45. Individual berths of appropriate dimensions shall be\n                            provided. Mattresses shall be of a suitable material.46. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the minimum\n                            inside dimensions of the berths shall not be less than 198 by 80\n                            centimetres.47. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 46, the\n                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum\n                            inside dimensions of the berths shall not be less than 190 by 70\n                            centimetres, where it is satisfied that this is reasonable and will not\n                            result in discomfort to the fishers.48. Sleeping rooms shall be so planned and equipped as to\n                            ensure reasonable comfort for the occupants and to facilitate tidiness.\n                            Equipment provided shall include berths, individual lockers sufficient\n                            for clothing and other personal effects, and a suitable writing\n                            surface.49. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, a desk\n                            suitable for writing, with a chair, shall be provided.50. Sleeping accommodation shall be situated or equipped, as\n                            practicable, so as to provide appropriate levels of privacy for men and\n                            for women.\n\n51. Mess rooms shall be as close as possible to the galley,\n                            but in no case shall be located forward of the collision bulkhead.52. Vessels shall be provided with mess-room accommodation\n                            suitable for their service. To the extent not expressly provided\n                            otherwise, mess-room accommodation shall be separate from sleeping\n                            quarters, where practicable.53. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, mess-room\n                            accommodation shall be separate from sleeping quarters.54. The dimensions and equipment of each mess room shall be\n                            sufficient for the number of persons likely to use it at any one\n                            time.55. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, a\n                            refrigerator of sufficient capacity and facilities for making hot and\n                            cold drinks shall be available and accessible to fishers at all\n                            times.\n\n56. Sanitary facilities, which include toilets, washbasins,\n                            and tubs or showers, shall be provided for all persons on board, as\n                            appropriate for the service of the vessel. These facilities shall meet\n                            at least minimum standards of health and hygiene and reasonable\n                            standards of quality.57. The sanitary accommodation shall be such as to eliminate\n                            contamination of other spaces as far as practicable. The sanitary\n                            facilities shall allow for reasonable privacy.58. Cold fresh water and hot fresh water shall be available\n                            to all fishers and other persons on board, in sufficient quantities to\n                            allow for proper hygiene. The competent authority may establish, after\n                            consultation, the minimum amount of water to be provided.59. Where sanitary facilities are provided, they shall be\n                            fitted with ventilation to the open air, independent of any other part\n                            of the accommodation.60. All surfaces in sanitary accommodation shall be such as\n                            to facilitate easy and effective cleaning. Floors shall have a non-slip\n                            deck covering.61. On vessels of 24 metres in length and over, for all\n                            fishers who do not occupy rooms to which sanitary facilities are\n                            attached, there shall be provided at least one tub or shower or both,\n                            one toilet, and one washbasin for every four persons or fewer.62.

Amenities for washing and drying clothes shall be\n                            provided as necessary, taking into account the service of the vessel, to\n                            the extent not expressly provided otherwise.64. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, adequate\n                            facilities for washing, drying and ironing clothes shall be\n                            provided.65. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, adequate\n                            facilities for washing, drying and ironing clothes shall be provided in\n                            a compartment separate from sleeping rooms, mess rooms and toilets, and\n                            shall be adequately ventilated, heated and equipped with lines or other\n                            means for drying clothes.\n\n66. Whenever necessary, a cabin shall be made available for a\n                            fisher who suffers illness or injury.67. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be a separate sick bay. The space shall be properly equipped and shall\n                            be maintained in a hygienic state.\n\n68. A place for hanging foul-weather gear and other personal\n                            protective equipment shall be provided outside of, but convenient to,\n                            sleeping rooms.\n\n69. Appropriate eating utensils, and bedding and other linen\n                            shall be provided to all fishers on board. However, the cost of the\n                            linen can be recovered as an operational cost if the collective\n                            agreement or the fisher's work agreement so provides.\n\n70. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, appropriate\n                            recreational facilities, amenities and services shall be provided for\n                            all fishers on board. Where appropriate, mess rooms may be used for\n                            recreational activities.\n\n71. All fishers on board shall be given reasonable access to\n                            communication facilities, to the extent practicable, at a reasonable\n                            cost and not exceeding the full cost to the fishing vessel owner.\n\n72. Cooking equipment shall be provided on board. To the\n                            extent not expressly provided otherwise, this equipment shall be fitted,\n                            where practicable, in a separate galley.73. The galley, or cooking area where a separate galley is\n                            not provided, shall be of adequate size for the purpose, well lit and\n                            ventilated, and properly equipped and maintained.74. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall\n                            be a separate galley.75. The containers of butane or propane gas used for cooking\n                            purposes in a galley shall be kept on the open deck and in a shelter\n                            which is designed to protect them from external heat sources and\n                            external impact.76.
