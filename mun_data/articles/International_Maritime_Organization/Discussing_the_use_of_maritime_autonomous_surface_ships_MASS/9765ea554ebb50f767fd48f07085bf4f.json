Interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems poses a serious risk to shipping activities, which could cause collisions and grounding. I urge all Member States to act to protect these critical systems.”  Download the joint statementShips and ports rely on GNSS for a wide array of applications relating to position, velocity and precise universal and local time which are used mainly for navigation purposes and, most importantly, on systems that are part of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).  Regulation V/19.2.1.6 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974, requires that “all ships, irrespective of size, shall have a receiver for a global navigation satellite system or a terrestrial radionavigation system, or other means, suitable for use at all times throughout the intended voyage to establish and update the ship’s position by automatic means.”  IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee, through MSC.1/Circ.1644, has “urged Member States to take actions necessary to minimize interference coming from their territory, as required under the ITU Radio Regulations; consider issuing warning notices or advisories to mariners specifying the time periods and areas impacted by any known interferences to minimize negative effects upon maritime operations; and consider enacting measures that prevent unauthorized transmissions on recognized satellite navigation system frequencies.” Article 4.10 of the ITU Radio Regulations states: “Member States recognize that the safety aspects of radionavigation and other safety services require special measures to ensure their freedom from harmful interference; it is necessary therefore to take this factor into account in the assignment and use of frequencies.” ICAO Secretary-General Juan Carlos Salazar said: “Radio Navigation Satellite Service interference can impact aircraft operations far beyond the immediate affected area, creating potential safety risks across multiple flight regions. ICAO is fully committed to working closely with Member States to implement these protective measures through existing aviation safety frameworks and standards.” \"Global Navigation Satellite Systems are critical to our safety on land, at sea and in the air,” said ITU Secretary-General Doreen Bogdan-Martin. “Member States should ensure the uninterrupted operation of these systems for everyone’s safety and the resilience of essential services that our lives depend on.”***Media contactsITU Media Contact David Hirsch, pressinfo@itu.intICAO Media Contact William Raillant-Clark Communications Officer wraillantclark@icao.int IMO Media Contact Josephine Latu-Sanft Media and Communications Officer media@imo.org\n\n25 March 2025\nProtect satellite navigation from interference, UN agencies urge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                    Aviation, maritime and telecoms agencies raise alarm over increase in jamming and spoofing of satellite navigation systems.  \r\n                                \n\n\nUN Agencies ITU, ICAO, and IMO have expressed their “grave concern” over increase in jamming and spoofing of satellite navigation systems.  \n\n\nIncreasing incidents of interference with aviation, maritime and other satellite telecommunications services mean States need to urgently enhance their protection of a critical radio-frequency band, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and International Maritime Organization (IMO) said with “grave concern” in a joint statement.These cases of harmful interference are in the form of jamming and spoofing that disrupt Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) operating in the frequency bands allocated to the Radio Navigation Satellite Service (RNSS).  The joint statement, signed by the Secretaries-General of the three UN specialized agencies, identifies five key actions required from Member States: Protection of RNSS from harmful interference affecting civilian and humanitarian operations. Strengthening resilience of RNSS-dependent navigation, positioning, and timing systems. Maintaining conventional navigation infrastructure for contingency support. Enhancing collaboration between regulatory, aviation, maritime, defense, and enforcement authorities. Implementing comprehensive interference reporting mechanisms. IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez said: “The safety of seafarers and shipping relies on the resilience of systems to support safe navigation and communication.
