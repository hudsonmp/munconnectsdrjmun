The draft amendments had been approved by MSC 107 and reviewed by the joint ILO/IMO Tripartite Working Group to Identify and Address Seafarers' Issues and the Human Element (JTWG).     The amendments are included in table A-VI/1-4 (Specification of minimum standard of competence in personal safety and social responsibilities) of the STCW Code. They outline new mandatory minimum requirements for basic training and instruction for all seafarers. These aim to equip seafarers with knowledge and understanding of violence and harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying and sexual assault, and information on how to prevent and respond to incidents. The amendments to the STCW Code are expected to enter into force on 1 January 2026.   The Committee approved other recommendations from the JTWG, including the launch of awareness campaigns and other further measures to address violence and harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying and sexual assault, applicable to Administrations, shipping companies, social partners and UN agencies.  Guidelines for port State and flag State authorities on how to deal with seafarer abandonment cases The first meeting of the  joint International Labour Organization (ILO)–International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tripartite Working Group (December 2022) adopted guidelines on how to deal with seafarer abandonment.  The IMO Legal Committee (LEG 110) adopted a resolution (LEG.6(110)) with the Guidelines for port State and flag State authorities on how to deal with seafarer abandonment cases.Download the Guidelines for port State and flag State authorities on how to deal with seafarer abandonment cases  here.  The Guidelines seek to address the significant rise in cases of abandonment of crews reported to the ILO. The Guidelines aim to improve coordination among countries, including flag States, port States, States in which seafarers are national or resident, and States in which recruitment and placement services operate, in order to resolve abandonment cases more quickly, including getting seafarers paid and repatriated home to their families. The Guidelines draw on relevant ILO international labour standards, notably the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, as amended (MLC, 2006), including its most recent amendments; an earlier joint ILO-IMO resolution adopted in 2001 (resolution A.930(22)); relevant IMO international frameworks and agreements; and relevant trends and developments in regional and national law and practice. The Guidelines set out procedures to be taken by States if a shipowner fails to fulfil their obligations to arrange and cover the cost of repatriation of seafarers, outstanding wages and other contracted entitlements, and the provision of essential needs, including medical care. In these circumstances seafarers are then considered abandoned. These procedures include developing, in cooperation with seafarers’ and shipowners’ organizations, national Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to explicitly define the liabilities and obligations of the competent authority and the roles to be played by the various national stakeholders. These stakeholders include the relevant national seafarers’ welfare boards, shipping agencies, seafarers’ and shipowners’ organizations, seafarer welfare organizations, seafarer recruitment and placement services, and others. Guidelines developed by ILO/IMO Guidelines for port State and flag State authorities on how to deal with seafarer abandonment cases (Adopted in 2022/2023)Guidelines on fair treatment of seafarers in the event of a maritime accident  (Adopted in 2006) Guidelines on Shipowners' Responsibilities in Respect of Contractual Claims for Personal Injury to or Death of Seafarers (Adopted in 2001).
