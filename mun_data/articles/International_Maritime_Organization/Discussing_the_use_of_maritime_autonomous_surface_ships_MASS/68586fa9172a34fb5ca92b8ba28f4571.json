Abandonment is characterized by the failure to: 1. Pay for the seafarer's return home; or2. Provide the seafarer without essential support and care; or3. Pay the seafarer's wages for at least two months.What is the ILO/IMO Joint Database?The joint database, hosted by the ILO, tracks reported incidents of seafarer abandonment, providing critical information on past and current cases. This includes abandoned fishers and seafarers, helping to facilitate coordinated responses from authorities, international organizations, and the maritime community. The database was established with the support of the International Ship Suppliers & Services Association, following a 2004 initiative by the Joint IMO/ILO Ad Hoc Expert Working Group on Liability and Compensation for Death, Injury, and Abandonment of Seafarers.In 2014, the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006) was amended to require shipowners to hold compulsory insurance to cover abandonment, ensuring seafarers have access to financial support if they are abandoned.How are the abandonment cases categorized?To clearly identify the status of each reported case, the database categorizes cases using a colour-coded system:•\tUnresolved Cases: Abandonment issues are ongoing.•\tResolved Cases: The crew has been repatriated, and all wages and entitlements have been paid.•\tDisputed Cases: There is uncertainty or disagreement over the resolution status.•\tInactive Cases: These cases are no longer active but remain unresolved.How can an abandonment case be reported?Governments and relevant organizations can report new abandonment cases using the provided PDF template.
