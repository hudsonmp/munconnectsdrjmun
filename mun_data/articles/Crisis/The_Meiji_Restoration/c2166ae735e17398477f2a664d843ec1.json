The most popular in the late 1800s were hanafuda, cards printed with beautiful, colorful images of flowers.

The firm was the first to produce durable plastic-coated playing cards in Japan, and struck a deal to print cards with Disney characters on the backs. This had the effect of widening the market for playing cards, turning a gambler's tool into a children's toy.The Nintendo company stayed in the hands of the Yamauchi family for over a century. Fusajiro Yamauchi's great-grandson Hiroshi took over in 1949 at the young age of 22.One of the new president's first acts was to have all remaining Yamauchi family members fired, so that it would be clear who was in charge. Yamauchi oversaw the expansion of the company out of the playing-card business and into a wide variety of other products, all of which were failures – until the company moved into electronic toys and games.Forging a partnership with the hardware maker Sharp that has lasted to this day, Nintendo engineers developed unique electronic toys like the Beam Gun, which used solar cells to let kids imagine they were firing a gun and making targets explode. From there, the company expanded into home and arcade videogames.Nintendo, to this day, is the predominant playing-card maker in Japan, still producing hanafuda decks, although some of them now have Super Mario characters printed on them instead of flowers.Source: Wikipedia, Game Over by David Sheff, othersImage: Nintendo poster from late Meiji era/WikipediaSee Also:Oct. 10, 1979: Pac-Man Brings Gaming Into Pleistocene EraNov. 19, 1981: Marcos Regime Puts the Kibosh on GamesNov. 13, 1982: Teen Sets 'Asteroids' Record in 3-Day MarathonMay 5, 1992: 'Wolfenstein 3-D' Shoots the First-Person ShooterSept. 24, 1993: Beautiful 'Myst' Ushers In Era of CD-ROM GamingJuly 3, 1999: Gobbling Up a 'Pac-Man' RecordVirtual Boy, Nintendo's Big 3-D Flop, Turns 15April 2, 1889: Aluminum Process Foils Steep PricesJune 3, 1889: Power Flows Long-DistanceNov. 14, 1889: Around the World in Only 72 Days1889 Pandemic Didn't Need Planes to Circle Globe in 4 Months1889 Pennsylvania Flood Was as Big as Mississippi RiverSept. 23, 1846: Neptune Right Where They Said It Would BeSept. 23, 1869: Here Comes Typhoid MaryChris Kohler started writing for WIRED in 2002, and founded WIRED.com's Game|Life channel in 2005.
