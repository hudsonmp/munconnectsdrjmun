The causes of the Great Depression included slowing consumer demand, mounting consumer debt, decreased industrial production and the rapid and reckless expansion of the U.S. stock market. When the stock market crashed in October 1929, it triggered a crisis in the international economy, which was linked via the gold standard. A rash of bank failures followed in 1930, and as the Dust Bowl increased the number of farm foreclosures, unemployment topped 20 percent by 1933. Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to stimulate the economy with a range of incentives including Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, but ultimately it took the manufacturing production increases of World War II to end the Great Depression.What Caused the Great Depression?Throughout the 1920s, the U.S. economy expanded rapidly, and the nation’s total wealth more than doubled between 1920 and 1929, a period dubbed “the Roaring Twenties.”The stock market, centered at the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New York City, was the scene of reckless speculation, where everyone from millionaire tycoons to cooks and janitors poured their savings into stocks. As a result, the stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929.Stock Market Crash of 1929Black Thursday brings the roaring twenties to a screaming halt, ushering in a world-wide an economic depression.By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stock prices much higher than their actual value. Additionally, wages at that time were low, consumer debt was proliferating, the agricultural sector of the economy was struggling due to drought and falling food prices and banks had an excess of large loans that could not be liquidated.The American economy entered a mild recession during the summer of 1929, as consumer spending slowed and unsold goods began to pile up, which in turn slowed factory production. Nonetheless, stock prices continued to rise, and by the fall of that year had reached stratospheric levels that could not be justified by expected future earnings.Stock Market Crash of 1929On October 24, 1929, as nervous investors began selling overpriced shares en masse, the stock market crash that some had feared happened at last. A record 12.9 million shares were traded that day, known as “Black Thursday.”Five days later, on October 29, or “Black Tuesday,” some 16 million shares were traded after another wave of panic swept Wall Street. Millions of shares ended up worthless, and those investors who had bought stocks “on margin” (with borrowed money) were wiped out completely.As consumer confidence vanished in the wake of the stock market crash, the downturn in spending and investment led factories and other businesses to slow down production and begin firing their workers. For those who were lucky enough to remain employed, wages fell and buying power decreased.Many Americans forced to buy on credit fell into debt, and the number of foreclosures and repossessions climbed steadily. The global adherence to the gold standard, which joined countries around the world in fixed currency exchange, helped spread economic woes from the United States throughout the world, especially in Europe.How Did the Gold Standard Contribute to the Great Depression?A number of complex factors helped to create the conditions necessary for the Great Depression—adherence to the gold standard was just one of those factors.By: Lindsey KonkelBank Runs and the Hoover AdministrationDespite assurances from President Herbert Hoover and other leaders that the crisis would run its course, matters continued to get worse over the next three years. By 1930, 4 million Americans looking for work could not find it; that number had risen to 6 million in 1931.Meanwhile, the country’s industrial production had dropped by half. Bread lines, soup kitchens and rising numbers of homeless people became more and more common in America’s towns and cities. Farmers couldn’t afford to harvest their crops and were forced to leave them rotting in the fields while people elsewhere starved. In 1930, severe droughts in the Southern Plains brought high winds and dust from Texas to Nebraska, killing people, livestock and crops. The “Dust Bowl” inspired a mass migration of people from farmland to cities in search of work.In the fall of 1930, the first of four waves of banking panics began, as large numbers of investors lost confidence in the solvency of their banks and demanded deposits in cash, forcing banks to liquidate loans in order to supplement their insufficient cash reserves on hand.Bank runs swept the United States again in the spring and fall of 1931 and the fall of 1932, and by early 1933 thousands of banks had closed their doors.In the face of this dire situation, Hoover’s administration tried supporting failing banks and other institutions with government loans; the idea was that the banks in turn would loan to businesses, which would be able to hire back their employees.FDR and the Great DepressionFranklin D. Roosevelt's First Fireside ChatThe American people stood glued to their radios as Franklin D. Roosevelt conducted his first Fireside Chat, in which he discouraged hoarding and inspired renewed faith in banks.Hoover, a Republican who had formerly served as U.S. secretary of commerce, believed that government should not directly intervene in the economy and that it did not have the responsibility to create jobs or provide economic relief for its citizens.In 1932, however, with the country mired in the depths of the Great Depression and some 15 million people unemployed, Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won an overwhelming victory in the presidential election.By Inauguration Day (March 4, 1933), every U.S. state had ordered all remaining banks to close at the end of the fourth wave of banking panics, and the U.S. Treasury didn’t have enough cash to pay all government workers. Nonetheless, FDR (as he was known) projected a calm energy and optimism, famously declaring \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”Roosevelt took immediate action to address the country’s economic woes, first announcing a four-day “bank holiday” during which all banks would close so that Congress could pass reform legislation and reopen those banks determined to be sound. He also began addressing the public directly over the radio in a series of talks, and these so-called “fireside chats” went a long way toward restoring public confidence.During Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office, his administration passed legislation that aimed to stabilize industrial and agricultural production, create jobs and stimulate recovery.In addition, Roosevelt sought to reform the financial system, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect depositors’ accounts and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market and prevent abuses of the kind that led to the 1929 crash.The New Deal: A Road to RecoveryFranklin D. Roosevelt's New DealHow did President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal get the American economy back on track, and which components still have a major impact on today's society?Among the programs and institutions of the New Deal that aided in recovery from the Great Depression was the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which built dams and hydroelectric projects to control flooding and provide electric power to the impoverished Tennessee Valley region, and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a permanent jobs program that employed 8.5 million people from 1935 to 1943.When the Great Depression began, the United States was the only industrialized country in the world without some form of unemployment insurance or social security. In 1935, Congress passed the Social Security Act, which for the first time provided Americans with unemployment, disability and pensions for old age.After showing early signs of recovery beginning in the spring of 1933, the economy continued to improve throughout the next three years, during which real GDP (adjusted for inflation) grew at an average rate of 9 percent per year.A sharp recession hit in 1937, caused in part by the Federal Reserve’s decision to increase its requirements for money in reserve. Though the economy began improving again in 1938, this second severe contraction reversed many of the gains in production and employment and prolonged the effects of the Great Depression through the end of the decade.Depression-era hardships fueled the rise of extremist political movements in various European countries, most notably that of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime in Germany. German aggression led war to break out in Europe in 1939, and the WPA turned its attention to strengthening the military infrastructure of the United States, even as the country maintained its neutrality.African Americans in the Great DepressionOne-fifth of all Americans receiving federal relief during the Great Depression were Black, most in the rural South. But farm and domestic work, two major sectors in which Black workers were employed, were not included in the 1935 Social Security Act, meaning there was no safety net in times of uncertainty. Rather than fire domestic help, private employers could simply pay them less without legal repercussions. And those relief programs for which African Americans were eligible on paper were rife with discrimination in practice since all relief programs were administered locally.Despite these obstacles, Roosevelt’s “Black Cabinet,” led by Mary McLeod Bethune, ensured nearly every New Deal agency had a Black advisor. The number of African Americans working in government tripled.Women in the Great DepressionThere was one group of Americans who actually gained jobs during the Great Depression: Women. From 1930 to 1940, the number of employed women in the United States rose 24 percent from 10.5 million to 13 million Though they’d been steadily entering the workforce for decades, the financial pressures of the Great Depression drove women to seek employment in ever greater numbers as male breadwinners lost their jobs. The 22 percent decline in marriage rates between 1929 and 1939 also created an increase in single women in search of employment.Women during the Great Depression had a strong advocate in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who lobbied her husband for more women in office—like Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, the first woman to ever hold a cabinet position.Jobs available to women paid less but were more stable during the banking crisis: nursing, teaching and domestic work. They were supplanted by an increase in secretarial roles in FDR’s rapidly-expanding government. But there was a catch: over 25 percent of the National Recovery Administration’s wage codes set lower wages for women, and jobs created under the WPA confined women to fields like sewing and nursing that paid less than roles reserved for men.Married women faced an additional hurdle: By 1940, 26 states had placed restrictions known as marriage bars on their employment, as working wives were perceived as taking away jobs from able-bodied men—even if, in practice, they were occupying jobs men would not want and doing them for far less pay.Great Depression Ends and World War II BeginsWith Roosevelt’s decision to support Britain and France in the struggle against Germany and the other Axis Powers, defense manufacturing geared up, producing more and more private-sector jobs.The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to America’s entry into World War II, and the nation’s factories went back into full production mode.This expanding industrial production, as well as widespread conscription beginning in 1942, reduced the unemployment rate to below its pre-Depression level. The Great Depression had ended at last, and the United States turned its attention to the global conflict of World War II.Photo GalleriesIn the mid-1930s, the Farm Security Administration’s Resettlement Administration hired photographers to document the work done by the agency. Some of the most powerful images were captured by photographer Dorothea Lange. Lange took this photo in New Mexico in 1935, noting, “It was conditions of this sort which forced many farmers to abandon the area.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationArthur Rothstein was one of the first photographers to join the Farm Security Administration. His most noteworthy contribution during his five years with FSA may have been this photograph, showing a (supposedly posed) farmer walking in the face of a dust storm with his sons in Oklahoma, 1936.Arthur Rothstein/Farm Security AdministrationOklahoma dust bowl refugees reach San Fernando, California in their overloaded vehicle in this 1935 FSA photo by Lange.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationMigrants from Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Mexico pick carrots on a California farm in 1937. A caption with Lange’s image reads, “We come from all states and we can’t make a dollar in this field noways. Working from seven in the morning until twelve noon, we earn an average of thirty-five cents.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationThis Texas tenant farmer brought his family to Marysville, California in 1935. He shared his story with photographer Lange, saying, “1927 made $7000 in cotton. 1928 broke even. 1929 went in the hole. 1930 went in still deeper. 1931 lost everything. 1932 hit the road.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationA family of 22 set up camp alongside the highway in Bakersfield, California in 1935. The family told Lange they were without shelter, without water and were looking for work on cotton farms.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationA pea picker’s makeshift home in Nipomo, California, 1936. Lange noted on the back of this photograph, “The condition of these people warrant resettlement camps for migrant agricultural workers.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationAmong Dorothea Lange’s most iconic photos was of this woman in Nipomo, California in 1936. As a mother of seven at age 32, she worked as a pea picker to support her family.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationThe family who lived in this make-shift home, photographed in Coachella Valley, California in 1935, picked dates on a farm.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationCalifornians derided the newcomers as “hillbillies,” “fruit tramps” and other names, but “Okie”—a term applied to migrants regardless of what state they came from—was the one that seemed to stick. The beginning of World War II would finally turn migrants’ fortunes as many headed to cities to work in factories as part of the war effort.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationWalker Evans was among a handful of photographers hired by the Farm Security Administration to document the lives of farmers and the challenges of rural poverty from 1935–1944. Here, a farmer and mule team toil in a field near Tupelo, Mississippi.Getty ImagesThe black-and-white photos portion of Evans’ collection comprises about 175,000 film negatives, many of which showcase slice-of-life moments during the Great Depression, including this roadside food stand.Getty ImagesThis is a 1936 portrait of Floyd Burroughs, a cotton sharecropper, shot by Evans in Hale County, Alabama. At harvest time every year, Burroughs had to give his landlord half his cotton and corn crop, and pay off any other debts incurred during the year for food, seed, fertilizer and medicine.Getty ImagesWhile collaborating with writer James Agee on an article about cotton farmers in the south, Evans took photos of sharecropper families and the environments they lived in. The article later became the seminal book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” In it, Agee observes how household objects set apart from one another take on unique significance, with each object gaining “a full strength it would not otherwise have.”Getty ImagesShot on a large format film camera, this photo by Evans of houses in the African American quarters of Tupelo, Mississippi, highlight the meager living conditions Black Americans faced during the Great Depression.Getty ImagesWalker Evans shot this 1936 photo of Bud Fields sitting with his wife Ivy as she nurses their daughter Ellen in Hale County, Alabama. Evans lived with the family for a month while photographing their lives for what would later become “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.”Getty ImagesAllie Mae Burroughs, the wife of sharecropper Floyd Burroughs, photographed during the Great Depression. Evans took a majority of his Hale County photographs in the Burroughs’ four-room cabin, including four portraits of Allie Mae.Getty ImagesFloyd Burroughs poses with his three children on their porch in Hale County, Alabama, 1936.Getty ImagesPeople sit outside stores and on porches overlooking desolate streets in the African American quarters of Savannah, Georgia, in 1935.Getty ImagesWalker Evans’ series of men in front of barber shops in Vicksburg, Mississippi—including this photo—is considered among his best work.Getty ImagesTwo African American sharecroppers, a woman and a man sitting behind her, pose for Walker Evans in Pulaski County, Arkansas, in 1935.Getty ImagesScenes of miners’ houses in Vicinity Birmingham, Alabama, such as this image, showcase the relative comfort of the homes they inhabited compared to those of sharecroppers living in Hale County not far away. Still, some inhabitants were likely unemployed and receiving government assistance just like Evans, who prior to accepting work from the FSA, was broke and unemployed.Getty ImagesThis monochrome photograph of a carpenter holding his toolbox on his shoulder was shot by Evans in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, 1935.Getty ImagesEvans photographed this bustling scene on Main Street in Macon, Georgia in 1936.Getty ImagesPeople line up for mealtime at a flood refugee camp in Forrest City, Arkansas, March 1936.Getty ImagesThe Farm Security Administration (FSA) was created as part of the New Deal to build relief camps and offer loans and relocation assistance to farmers impacted by the Depression and the Dust Bowl.

The father’s wages was $1 a day.Getty ImagesMigrant workers toiling a field. Lange’s colleague, Ron Partridge described how Lange would work, saying, “She would walk through the field and talk to people, asking simple questions—what are you picking? . . . How long have you been here? When do you eat lunch? . . . I’d like to photograph you, she’d say, and by now it would be ‘Sure, why not,’ and they would pose a little, but she would sort of ignore it, walk around until they forgot us and were back at work.”Getty ImagesThe wife of a migratory laborer and mother of three is captured by Lange’s lens in Texas.Getty ImagesThis photo shows a woman holding an infant, walking through a muddy migrants’ camp in California.New York Public Library/Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesChildren of drought refugees sit at the back of their family’s car as they arrive in California.Getty ImagesA Mexican-American mother and her baby photographed in June 1935 in CaliforniaGetty ImagesA drought refugee from Polk, Missouri awaits the start of orange-picking season in Porterville, California. As they traveled west from the drought-ravaged Midwest, American-born migrants were often viewed as intruders.Getty ImagesA teenage sharecropper works in a field in Georgia, circa 1937.Getty ImagesA migrant shed worker takes a break at his post in northeast Florida.Getty ImagesHere, farmers in drought-stricken Oklahoma sit in the shade in August 1936.The FSA created a historical archive unlike any made before.

But there was a catch: over 25 percent of the National Recovery Administration’s wage codes set lower wages for women, and jobs created under the WPA confined women to fields like sewing and nursing that paid less than roles reserved for men.Married women faced an additional hurdle: By 1940, 26 states had placed restrictions known as marriage bars on their employment, as working wives were perceived as taking away jobs from able-bodied men—even if, in practice, they were occupying jobs men would not want and doing them for far less pay.Great Depression Ends and World War II BeginsWith Roosevelt’s decision to support Britain and France in the struggle against Germany and the other Axis Powers, defense manufacturing geared up, producing more and more private-sector jobs.The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to America’s entry into World War II, and the nation’s factories went back into full production mode.This expanding industrial production, as well as widespread conscription beginning in 1942, reduced the unemployment rate to below its pre-Depression level. The Great Depression had ended at last, and the United States turned its attention to the global conflict of World War II.Photo GalleriesIn the mid-1930s, the Farm Security Administration’s Resettlement Administration hired photographers to document the work done by the agency. Some of the most powerful images were captured by photographer Dorothea Lange. Lange took this photo in New Mexico in 1935, noting, “It was conditions of this sort which forced many farmers to abandon the area.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationArthur Rothstein was one of the first photographers to join the Farm Security Administration. His most noteworthy contribution during his five years with FSA may have been this photograph, showing a (supposedly posed) farmer walking in the face of a dust storm with his sons in Oklahoma, 1936.Arthur Rothstein/Farm Security AdministrationOklahoma dust bowl refugees reach San Fernando, California in their overloaded vehicle in this 1935 FSA photo by Lange.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationMigrants from Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Mexico pick carrots on a California farm in 1937. A caption with Lange’s image reads, “We come from all states and we can’t make a dollar in this field noways. Working from seven in the morning until twelve noon, we earn an average of thirty-five cents.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationThis Texas tenant farmer brought his family to Marysville, California in 1935. He shared his story with photographer Lange, saying, “1927 made $7000 in cotton. 1928 broke even. 1929 went in the hole. 1930 went in still deeper. 1931 lost everything. 1932 hit the road.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationA family of 22 set up camp alongside the highway in Bakersfield, California in 1935.

As a mother of seven at age 32, she worked as a pea picker to support her family.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationThe family who lived in this make-shift home, photographed in Coachella Valley, California in 1935, picked dates on a farm.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationCalifornians derided the newcomers as “hillbillies,” “fruit tramps” and other names, but “Okie”—a term applied to migrants regardless of what state they came from—was the one that seemed to stick. The beginning of World War II would finally turn migrants’ fortunes as many headed to cities to work in factories as part of the war effort.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationWalker Evans was among a handful of photographers hired by the Farm Security Administration to document the lives of farmers and the challenges of rural poverty from 1935–1944. Here, a farmer and mule team toil in a field near Tupelo, Mississippi.Getty ImagesThe black-and-white photos portion of Evans’ collection comprises about 175,000 film negatives, many of which showcase slice-of-life moments during the Great Depression, including this roadside food stand.Getty ImagesThis is a 1936 portrait of Floyd Burroughs, a cotton sharecropper, shot by Evans in Hale County, Alabama. At harvest time every year, Burroughs had to give his landlord half his cotton and corn crop, and pay off any other debts incurred during the year for food, seed, fertilizer and medicine.Getty ImagesWhile collaborating with writer James Agee on an article about cotton farmers in the south, Evans took photos of sharecropper families and the environments they lived in. The article later became the seminal book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” In it, Agee observes how household objects set apart from one another take on unique significance, with each object gaining “a full strength it would not otherwise have.”Getty ImagesShot on a large format film camera, this photo by Evans of houses in the African American quarters of Tupelo, Mississippi, highlight the meager living conditions Black Americans faced during the Great Depression.Getty ImagesWalker Evans shot this 1936 photo of Bud Fields sitting with his wife Ivy as she nurses their daughter Ellen in Hale County, Alabama.

Lange’s colleague, Ron Partridge described how Lange would work, saying, “She would walk through the field and talk to people, asking simple questions—what are you picking? . . . How long have you been here? When do you eat lunch? . . . I’d like to photograph you, she’d say, and by now it would be ‘Sure, why not,’ and they would pose a little, but she would sort of ignore it, walk around until they forgot us and were back at work.”Getty ImagesThe wife of a migratory laborer and mother of three is captured by Lange’s lens in Texas.Getty ImagesThis photo shows a woman holding an infant, walking through a muddy migrants’ camp in California.New York Public Library/Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesChildren of drought refugees sit at the back of their family’s car as they arrive in California.Getty ImagesA Mexican-American mother and her baby photographed in June 1935 in CaliforniaGetty ImagesA drought refugee from Polk, Missouri awaits the start of orange-picking season in Porterville, California. As they traveled west from the drought-ravaged Midwest, American-born migrants were often viewed as intruders.Getty ImagesA teenage sharecropper works in a field in Georgia, circa 1937.Getty ImagesA migrant shed worker takes a break at his post in northeast Florida.Getty ImagesHere, farmers in drought-stricken Oklahoma sit in the shade in August 1936.The FSA created a historical archive unlike any made before.

Roosevelt tried to stimulate the economy with a range of incentives including Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, but ultimately it took the manufacturing production increases of World War II to end the Great Depression.\n\nWhat Caused the Great Depression?Throughout the 1920s, the U.S. economy expanded rapidly, and the nation’s total wealth more than doubled between 1920 and 1929, a period dubbed “the Roaring Twenties.”The stock market, centered at the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New York City, was the scene of reckless speculation, where everyone from millionaire tycoons to cooks and janitors poured their savings into stocks. As a result, the stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929.Stock Market Crash of 1929Black Thursday brings the roaring twenties to a screaming halt, ushering in a world-wide an economic depression.By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stock prices much higher than their actual value. Additionally, wages at that time were low, consumer debt was proliferating, the agricultural sector of the economy was struggling due to drought and falling food prices and banks had an excess of large loans that could not be liquidated.The American economy entered a mild recession during the summer of 1929, as consumer spending slowed and unsold goods began to pile up, which in turn slowed factory production. Nonetheless, stock prices continued to rise, and by the fall of that year had reached stratospheric levels that could not be justified by expected future earnings.Stock Market Crash of 1929On October 24, 1929, as nervous investors began selling overpriced shares en masse, the stock market crash that some had feared happened at last. A record 12.9 million shares were traded that day, known as “Black Thursday.”Five days later, on October 29, or “Black Tuesday,” some 16 million shares were traded after another wave of panic swept Wall Street. Millions of shares ended up worthless, and those investors who had bought stocks “on margin” (with borrowed money) were wiped out completely.As consumer confidence vanished in the wake of the stock market crash, the downturn in spending and investment led factories and other businesses to slow down production and begin firing their workers. For those who were lucky enough to remain employed, wages fell and buying power decreased.Many Americans forced to buy on credit fell into debt, and the number of foreclosures and repossessions climbed steadily. The global adherence to the gold standard, which joined countries around the world in fixed currency exchange, helped spread economic woes from the United States throughout the world, especially in Europe.How Did the Gold Standard Contribute to the Great Depression?A number of complex factors helped to create the conditions necessary for the Great Depression—adherence to the gold standard was just one of those factors.By: Lindsey KonkelBank Runs and the Hoover AdministrationDespite assurances from President Herbert Hoover and other leaders that the crisis would run its course, matters continued to get worse over the next three years. By 1930, 4 million Americans looking for work could not find it; that number had risen to 6 million in 1931.Meanwhile, the country’s industrial production had dropped by half. Bread lines, soup kitchens and rising numbers of homeless people became more and more common in America’s towns and cities. Farmers couldn’t afford to harvest their crops and were forced to leave them rotting in the fields while people elsewhere starved. In 1930, severe droughts in the Southern Plains brought high winds and dust from Texas to Nebraska, killing people, livestock and crops. The “Dust Bowl” inspired a mass migration of people from farmland to cities in search of work.In the fall of 1930, the first of four waves of banking panics began, as large numbers of investors lost confidence in the solvency of their banks and demanded deposits in cash, forcing banks to liquidate loans in order to supplement their insufficient cash reserves on hand.Bank runs swept the United States again in the spring and fall of 1931 and the fall of 1932, and by early 1933 thousands of banks had closed their doors.In the face of this dire situation, Hoover’s administration tried supporting failing banks and other institutions with government loans; the idea was that the banks in turn would loan to businesses, which would be able to hire back their employees.FDR and the Great DepressionFranklin D. Roosevelt's First Fireside ChatThe American people stood glued to their radios as Franklin D. Roosevelt conducted his first Fireside Chat, in which he discouraged hoarding and inspired renewed faith in banks.Hoover, a Republican who had formerly served as U.S. secretary of commerce, believed that government should not directly intervene in the economy and that it did not have the responsibility to create jobs or provide economic relief for its citizens.In 1932, however, with the country mired in the depths of the Great Depression and some 15 million people unemployed, Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won an overwhelming victory in the presidential election.By Inauguration Day (March 4, 1933), every U.S. state had ordered all remaining banks to close at the end of the fourth wave of banking panics, and the U.S. Treasury didn’t have enough cash to pay all government workers. Nonetheless, FDR (as he was known) projected a calm energy and optimism, famously declaring \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”Roosevelt took immediate action to address the country’s economic woes, first announcing a four-day “bank holiday” during which all banks would close so that Congress could pass reform legislation and reopen those banks determined to be sound. He also began addressing the public directly over the radio in a series of talks, and these so-called “fireside chats” went a long way toward restoring public confidence.During Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office, his administration passed legislation that aimed to stabilize industrial and agricultural production, create jobs and stimulate recovery.In addition, Roosevelt sought to reform the financial system, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect depositors’ accounts and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market and prevent abuses of the kind that led to the 1929 crash.The New Deal: A Road to RecoveryFranklin D. Roosevelt's New DealHow did President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal get the American economy back on track, and which components still have a major impact on today's society?Among the programs and institutions of the New Deal that aided in recovery from the Great Depression was the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which built dams and hydroelectric projects to control flooding and provide electric power to the impoverished Tennessee Valley region, and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a permanent jobs program that employed 8.5 million people from 1935 to 1943.When the Great Depression began, the United States was the only industrialized country in the world without some form of unemployment insurance or social security. In 1935, Congress passed the Social Security Act, which for the first time provided Americans with unemployment, disability and pensions for old age.After showing early signs of recovery beginning in the spring of 1933, the economy continued to improve throughout the next three years, during which real GDP (adjusted for inflation) grew at an average rate of 9 percent per year.A sharp recession hit in 1937, caused in part by the Federal Reserve’s decision to increase its requirements for money in reserve. Though the economy began improving again in 1938, this second severe contraction reversed many of the gains in production and employment and prolonged the effects of the Great Depression through the end of the decade.Depression-era hardships fueled the rise of extremist political movements in various European countries, most notably that of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime in Germany. German aggression led war to break out in Europe in 1939, and the WPA turned its attention to strengthening the military infrastructure of the United States, even as the country maintained its neutrality.African Americans in the Great DepressionOne-fifth of all Americans receiving federal relief during the Great Depression were Black, most in the rural South. But farm and domestic work, two major sectors in which Black workers were employed, were not included in the 1935 Social Security Act, meaning there was no safety net in times of uncertainty. Rather than fire domestic help, private employers could simply pay them less without legal repercussions. And those relief programs for which African Americans were eligible on paper were rife with discrimination in practice since all relief programs were administered locally.Despite these obstacles, Roosevelt’s “Black Cabinet,” led by Mary McLeod Bethune, ensured nearly every New Deal agency had a Black advisor. The number of African Americans working in government tripled.Women in the Great DepressionThere was one group of Americans who actually gained jobs during the Great Depression: Women. From 1930 to 1940, the number of employed women in the United States rose 24 percent from 10.5 million to 13 million Though they’d been steadily entering the workforce for decades, the financial pressures of the Great Depression drove women to seek employment in ever greater numbers as male breadwinners lost their jobs. The 22 percent decline in marriage rates between 1929 and 1939 also created an increase in single women in search of employment.Women during the Great Depression had a strong advocate in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who lobbied her husband for more women in office—like Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, the first woman to ever hold a cabinet position.Jobs available to women paid less but were more stable during the banking crisis: nursing, teaching and domestic work. They were supplanted by an increase in secretarial roles in FDR’s rapidly-expanding government. But there was a catch: over 25 percent of the National Recovery Administration’s wage codes set lower wages for women, and jobs created under the WPA confined women to fields like sewing and nursing that paid less than roles reserved for men.Married women faced an additional hurdle: By 1940, 26 states had placed restrictions known as marriage bars on their employment, as working wives were perceived as taking away jobs from able-bodied men—even if, in practice, they were occupying jobs men would not want and doing them for far less pay.Great Depression Ends and World War II BeginsWith Roosevelt’s decision to support Britain and France in the struggle against Germany and the other Axis Powers, defense manufacturing geared up, producing more and more private-sector jobs.The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to America’s entry into World War II, and the nation’s factories went back into full production mode.This expanding industrial production, as well as widespread conscription beginning in 1942, reduced the unemployment rate to below its pre-Depression level. The Great Depression had ended at last, and the United States turned its attention to the global conflict of World War II.Photo GalleriesIn the mid-1930s, the Farm Security Administration’s Resettlement Administration hired photographers to document the work done by the agency.

Working from seven in the morning until twelve noon, we earn an average of thirty-five cents.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationThis Texas tenant farmer brought his family to Marysville, California in 1935. He shared his story with photographer Lange, saying, “1927 made $7000 in cotton. 1928 broke even. 1929 went in the hole. 1930 went in still deeper. 1931 lost everything. 1932 hit the road.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationA family of 22 set up camp alongside the highway in Bakersfield, California in 1935. The family told Lange they were without shelter, without water and were looking for work on cotton farms.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationA pea picker’s makeshift home in Nipomo, California, 1936. Lange noted on the back of this photograph, “The condition of these people warrant resettlement camps for migrant agricultural workers.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationAmong Dorothea Lange’s most iconic photos was of this woman in Nipomo, California in 1936. As a mother of seven at age 32, she worked as a pea picker to support her family.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationThe family who lived in this make-shift home, photographed in Coachella Valley, California in 1935, picked dates on a farm.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationCalifornians derided the newcomers as “hillbillies,” “fruit tramps” and other names, but “Okie”—a term applied to migrants regardless of what state they came from—was the one that seemed to stick. The beginning of World War II would finally turn migrants’ fortunes as many headed to cities to work in factories as part of the war effort.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationWalker Evans was among a handful of photographers hired by the Farm Security Administration to document the lives of farmers and the challenges of rural poverty from 1935–1944. Here, a farmer and mule team toil in a field near Tupelo, Mississippi.Getty ImagesThe black-and-white photos portion of Evans’ collection comprises about 175,000 film negatives, many of which showcase slice-of-life moments during the Great Depression, including this roadside food stand.Getty ImagesThis is a 1936 portrait of Floyd Burroughs, a cotton sharecropper, shot by Evans in Hale County, Alabama. At harvest time every year, Burroughs had to give his landlord half his cotton and corn crop, and pay off any other debts incurred during the year for food, seed, fertilizer and medicine.Getty ImagesWhile collaborating with writer James Agee on an article about cotton farmers in the south, Evans took photos of sharecropper families and the environments they lived in. The article later became the seminal book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” In it, Agee observes how household objects set apart from one another take on unique significance, with each object gaining “a full strength it would not otherwise have.”Getty ImagesShot on a large format film camera, this photo by Evans of houses in the African American quarters of Tupelo, Mississippi, highlight the meager living conditions Black Americans faced during the Great Depression.Getty ImagesWalker Evans shot this 1936 photo of Bud Fields sitting with his wife Ivy as she nurses their daughter Ellen in Hale County, Alabama. Evans lived with the family for a month while photographing their lives for what would later become “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.”Getty ImagesAllie Mae Burroughs, the wife of sharecropper Floyd Burroughs, photographed during the Great Depression.

Still, some inhabitants were likely unemployed and receiving government assistance just like Evans, who prior to accepting work from the FSA, was broke and unemployed.Getty ImagesThis monochrome photograph of a carpenter holding his toolbox on his shoulder was shot by Evans in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, 1935.Getty ImagesEvans photographed this bustling scene on Main Street in Macon, Georgia in 1936.Getty ImagesPeople line up for mealtime at a flood refugee camp in Forrest City, Arkansas, March 1936.Getty ImagesThe Farm Security Administration (FSA) was created as part of the New Deal to build relief camps and offer loans and relocation assistance to farmers impacted by the Depression and the Dust Bowl.

Lange’s colleague, Ron Partridge described how Lange would work, saying, “She would walk through the field and talk to people, asking simple questions—what are you picking? . . . How long have you been here? When do you eat lunch? . . . I’d like to photograph you, she’d say, and by now it would be ‘Sure, why not,’ and they would pose a little, but she would sort of ignore it, walk around until they forgot us and were back at work.”Getty ImagesThe wife of a migratory laborer and mother of three is captured by Lange’s lens in Texas.Getty ImagesThis photo shows a woman holding an infant, walking through a muddy migrants’ camp in California.New York Public Library/Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesChildren of drought refugees sit at the back of their family’s car as they arrive in California.Getty ImagesA Mexican-American mother and her baby photographed in June 1935 in CaliforniaGetty ImagesA drought refugee from Polk, Missouri awaits the start of orange-picking season in Porterville, California. As they traveled west from the drought-ravaged Midwest, American-born migrants were often viewed as intruders.Getty ImagesA teenage sharecropper works in a field in Georgia, circa 1937.Getty ImagesA migrant shed worker takes a break at his post in northeast Florida.Getty ImagesHere, farmers in drought-stricken Oklahoma sit in the shade in August 1936.The FSA created a historical archive unlike any made before. By the time the project was finished, FSA photographers had taken some 250,000 photographs.Getty ImagesArthur Rothstein was the first staff photographer hired to work for the Farm Security Administration. FSA photographers were tasked with documenting people’s living conditions in rural America so the images could be used to report back to Congress.Rothstein was born in New York City and studied at Columbia University. Here, Rothstein’s photo shows a woman spinning wool in Madison County, Arkansas.Getty ImagesAs farmers and their families in Great Plains and the Midwest lost their homes and livelihoods in the Dust Bowl, many headed west to California. Once they reached the west, they were often derided as “fruit tamps” or “Okies.” This photo shows a migrant worker in the Yakima Valley, California. Rothstein once said he believed the role of documentary photographers was to “examine and scrutinize in order to reveal the truth.”Getty ImagesThis photo shows evicted sharecroppers camping along Highway 60 in New Madrid County, Missouri. In 1935, 50 percent of all white farmers and 77 percent of all Black farmers were sharecroppers.Getty ImagesA migrant worker picks cranberries in Burlington County, New Jersey, 1938.Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesRothstein took this photo of an African American girl looking out the window of a log cabin in Gee’s Bend, Alabama in 1938.Getty ImagesMrs. Dobson and some of her nine children, as captured by Rothstein in 1935 in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia.Getty ImagesThis man spread sliced apples on a roof to dry to later sell them.

In 1935, Congress passed the Social Security Act, which for the first time provided Americans with unemployment, disability and pensions for old age.After showing early signs of recovery beginning in the spring of 1933, the economy continued to improve throughout the next three years, during which real GDP (adjusted for inflation) grew at an average rate of 9 percent per year.A sharp recession hit in 1937, caused in part by the Federal Reserve’s decision to increase its requirements for money in reserve. Though the economy began improving again in 1938, this second severe contraction reversed many of the gains in production and employment and prolonged the effects of the Great Depression through the end of the decade.Depression-era hardships fueled the rise of extremist political movements in various European countries, most notably that of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime in Germany. German aggression led war to break out in Europe in 1939, and the WPA turned its attention to strengthening the military infrastructure of the United States, even as the country maintained its neutrality.African Americans in the Great DepressionOne-fifth of all Americans receiving federal relief during the Great Depression were Black, most in the rural South. But farm and domestic work, two major sectors in which Black workers were employed, were not included in the 1935 Social Security Act, meaning there was no safety net in times of uncertainty. Rather than fire domestic help, private employers could simply pay them less without legal repercussions. And those relief programs for which African Americans were eligible on paper were rife with discrimination in practice since all relief programs were administered locally.Despite these obstacles, Roosevelt’s “Black Cabinet,” led by Mary McLeod Bethune, ensured nearly every New Deal agency had a Black advisor. The number of African Americans working in government tripled.Women in the Great DepressionThere was one group of Americans who actually gained jobs during the Great Depression: Women. From 1930 to 1940, the number of employed women in the United States rose 24 percent from 10.5 million to 13 million Though they’d been steadily entering the workforce for decades, the financial pressures of the Great Depression drove women to seek employment in ever greater numbers as male breadwinners lost their jobs. The 22 percent decline in marriage rates between 1929 and 1939 also created an increase in single women in search of employment.Women during the Great Depression had a strong advocate in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who lobbied her husband for more women in office—like Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, the first woman to ever hold a cabinet position.Jobs available to women paid less but were more stable during the banking crisis: nursing, teaching and domestic work. They were supplanted by an increase in secretarial roles in FDR’s rapidly-expanding government. But there was a catch: over 25 percent of the National Recovery Administration’s wage codes set lower wages for women, and jobs created under the WPA confined women to fields like sewing and nursing that paid less than roles reserved for men.Married women faced an additional hurdle: By 1940, 26 states had placed restrictions known as marriage bars on their employment, as working wives were perceived as taking away jobs from able-bodied men—even if, in practice, they were occupying jobs men would not want and doing them for far less pay.Great Depression Ends and World War II BeginsWith Roosevelt’s decision to support Britain and France in the struggle against Germany and the other Axis Powers, defense manufacturing geared up, producing more and more private-sector jobs.The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to America’s entry into World War II, and the nation’s factories went back into full production mode.This expanding industrial production, as well as widespread conscription beginning in 1942, reduced the unemployment rate to below its pre-Depression level.

Roosevelt tried to stimulate the economy with a range of incentives including Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, but ultimately it took the manufacturing production increases of World War II to end the Great Depression.What Caused the Great Depression?Throughout the 1920s, the U.S. The global adherence to the gold standard, which joined countries around the world in fixed currency exchange, helped spread economic woes from the United States throughout the world, especially in Europe.How Did the Gold Standard Contribute to the Great Depression?A number of complex factors helped to create the conditions necessary for the Great Depression—adherence to the gold standard was just one of those factors.By: Lindsey KonkelBank Runs and the Hoover AdministrationDespite assurances from President Herbert Hoover and other leaders that the crisis would run its course, matters continued to get worse over the next three years. The “Dust Bowl” inspired a mass migration of people from farmland to cities in search of work.In the fall of 1930, the first of four waves of banking panics began, as large numbers of investors lost confidence in the solvency of their banks and demanded deposits in cash, forcing banks to liquidate loans in order to supplement their insufficient cash reserves on hand.Bank runs swept the United States again in the spring and fall of 1931 and the fall of 1932, and by early 1933 thousands of banks had closed their doors.In the face of this dire situation, Hoover’s administration tried supporting failing banks and other institutions with government loans; the idea was that the banks in turn would loan to businesses, which would be able to hire back their employees.FDR and the Great DepressionFranklin D. He also began addressing the public directly over the radio in a series of talks, and these so-called “fireside chats” went a long way toward restoring public confidence.During Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office, his administration passed legislation that aimed to stabilize industrial and agricultural production, create jobs and stimulate recovery.In addition, Roosevelt sought to reform the financial system, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect depositors’ accounts and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market and prevent abuses of the kind that led to the 1929 crash.The New Deal: A Road to RecoveryFranklin D. Roosevelt's New DealHow did President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal get the American economy back on track, and which components still have a major impact on today's society?Among the programs and institutions of the New Deal that aided in recovery from the Great Depression was the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which built dams and hydroelectric projects to control flooding and provide electric power to the impoverished Tennessee Valley region, and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a permanent jobs program that employed 8.5 million people from 1935 to 1943.When the Great Depression began, the United States was the only industrialized country in the world without some form of unemployment insurance or social security. The 22 percent decline in marriage rates between 1929 and 1939 also created an increase in single women in search of employment.Women during the Great Depression had a strong advocate in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who lobbied her husband for more women in office—like Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, the first woman to ever hold a cabinet position.Jobs available to women paid less but were more stable during the banking crisis: nursing, teaching and domestic work. But there was a catch: over 25 percent of the National Recovery Administration’s wage codes set lower wages for women, and jobs created under the WPA confined women to fields like sewing and nursing that paid less than roles reserved for men.Married women faced an additional hurdle: By 1940, 26 states had placed restrictions known as marriage bars on their employment, as working wives were perceived as taking away jobs from able-bodied men—even if, in practice, they were occupying jobs men would not want and doing them for far less pay.Great Depression Ends and World War II BeginsWith Roosevelt’s decision to support Britain and France in the struggle against Germany and the other Axis Powers, defense manufacturing geared up, producing more and more private-sector jobs.The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to America’s entry into World War II, and the nation’s factories went back into full production mode.This expanding industrial production, as well as widespread conscription beginning in 1942, reduced the unemployment rate to below its pre-Depression level. The Great Depression had ended at last, and the United States turned its attention to the global conflict of World War II.Photo GalleriesIn the mid-1930s, the Farm Security Administration’s Resettlement Administration hired photographers to document the work done by the agency. Lange took this photo in New Mexico in 1935, noting, “It was conditions of this sort which forced many farmers to abandon the area.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationArthur Rothstein was one of the first photographers to join the Farm Security Administration. His most noteworthy contribution during his five years with FSA may have been this photograph, showing a (supposedly posed) farmer walking in the face of a dust storm with his sons in Oklahoma, 1936.Arthur Rothstein/Farm Security AdministrationOklahoma dust bowl refugees reach San Fernando, California in their overloaded vehicle in this 1935 FSA photo by Lange.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationMigrants from Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Mexico pick carrots on a California farm in 1937. As a mother of seven at age 32, she worked as a pea picker to support her family.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationThe family who lived in this make-shift home, photographed in Coachella Valley, California in 1935, picked dates on a farm.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationCalifornians derided the newcomers as “hillbillies,” “fruit tramps” and other names, but “Okie”—a term applied to migrants regardless of what state they came from—was the one that seemed to stick. The beginning of World War II would finally turn migrants’ fortunes as many headed to cities to work in factories as part of the war effort.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationWalker Evans was among a handful of photographers hired by the Farm Security Administration to document the lives of farmers and the challenges of rural poverty from 1935–1944. Here, a farmer and mule team toil in a field near Tupelo, Mississippi.Getty ImagesThe black-and-white photos portion of Evans’ collection comprises about 175,000 film negatives, many of which showcase slice-of-life moments during the Great Depression, including this roadside food stand.Getty ImagesThis is a 1936 portrait of Floyd Burroughs, a cotton sharecropper, shot by Evans in Hale County, Alabama. The article later became the seminal book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” In it, Agee observes how household objects set apart from one another take on unique significance, with each object gaining “a full strength it would not otherwise have.”Getty ImagesShot on a large format film camera, this photo by Evans of houses in the African American quarters of Tupelo, Mississippi, highlight the meager living conditions Black Americans faced during the Great Depression.Getty ImagesWalker Evans shot this 1936 photo of Bud Fields sitting with his wife Ivy as she nurses their daughter Ellen in Hale County, Alabama. Evans lived with the family for a month while photographing their lives for what would later become “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.”Getty ImagesAllie Mae Burroughs, the wife of sharecropper Floyd Burroughs, photographed during the Great Depression.

Still, some inhabitants were likely unemployed and receiving government assistance just like Evans, who prior to accepting work from the FSA, was broke and unemployed.Getty ImagesThis monochrome photograph of a carpenter holding his toolbox on his shoulder was shot by Evans in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, 1935.Getty ImagesEvans photographed this bustling scene on Main Street in Macon, Georgia in 1936.Getty ImagesPeople line up for mealtime at a flood refugee camp in Forrest City, Arkansas, March 1936.Getty ImagesThe Farm Security Administration (FSA) was created as part of the New Deal to build relief camps and offer loans and relocation assistance to farmers impacted by the Depression and the Dust Bowl.

I’d like to photograph you, she’d say, and by now it would be ‘Sure, why not,’ and they would pose a little, but she would sort of ignore it, walk around until they forgot us and were back at work.”Getty ImagesThe wife of a migratory laborer and mother of three is captured by Lange’s lens in Texas.Getty ImagesThis photo shows a woman holding an infant, walking through a muddy migrants’ camp in California.New York Public Library/Smith Collection/Gado/Getty ImagesChildren of drought refugees sit at the back of their family’s car as they arrive in California.Getty ImagesA Mexican-American mother and her baby photographed in June 1935 in CaliforniaGetty ImagesA drought refugee from Polk, Missouri awaits the start of orange-picking season in Porterville, California.

The global adherence to the gold standard, which joined countries around the world in fixed currency exchange, helped spread economic woes from the United States throughout the world, especially in Europe.How Did the Gold Standard Contribute to the Great Depression?A number of complex factors helped to create the conditions necessary for the Great Depression—adherence to the gold standard was just one of those factors.By: Lindsey KonkelBank Runs and the Hoover AdministrationDespite assurances from President Herbert Hoover and other leaders that the crisis would run its course, matters continued to get worse over the next three years. The “Dust Bowl” inspired a mass migration of people from farmland to cities in search of work.In the fall of 1930, the first of four waves of banking panics began, as large numbers of investors lost confidence in the solvency of their banks and demanded deposits in cash, forcing banks to liquidate loans in order to supplement their insufficient cash reserves on hand.Bank runs swept the United States again in the spring and fall of 1931 and the fall of 1932, and by early 1933 thousands of banks had closed their doors.In the face of this dire situation, Hoover’s administration tried supporting failing banks and other institutions with government loans; the idea was that the banks in turn would loan to businesses, which would be able to hire back their employees.FDR and the Great DepressionFranklin D. He also began addressing the public directly over the radio in a series of talks, and these so-called “fireside chats” went a long way toward restoring public confidence.During Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office, his administration passed legislation that aimed to stabilize industrial and agricultural production, create jobs and stimulate recovery.In addition, Roosevelt sought to reform the financial system, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect depositors’ accounts and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market and prevent abuses of the kind that led to the 1929 crash.The New Deal: A Road to RecoveryFranklin D. Roosevelt's New DealHow did President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal get the American economy back on track, and which components still have a major impact on today's society?Among the programs and institutions of the New Deal that aided in recovery from the Great Depression was the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which built dams and hydroelectric projects to control flooding and provide electric power to the impoverished Tennessee Valley region, and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a permanent jobs program that employed 8.5 million people from 1935 to 1943.When the Great Depression began, the United States was the only industrialized country in the world without some form of unemployment insurance or social security. The 22 percent decline in marriage rates between 1929 and 1939 also created an increase in single women in search of employment.Women during the Great Depression had a strong advocate in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who lobbied her husband for more women in office—like Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, the first woman to ever hold a cabinet position.Jobs available to women paid less but were more stable during the banking crisis: nursing, teaching and domestic work. But there was a catch: over 25 percent of the National Recovery Administration’s wage codes set lower wages for women, and jobs created under the WPA confined women to fields like sewing and nursing that paid less than roles reserved for men.Married women faced an additional hurdle: By 1940, 26 states had placed restrictions known as marriage bars on their employment, as working wives were perceived as taking away jobs from able-bodied men—even if, in practice, they were occupying jobs men would not want and doing them for far less pay.Great Depression Ends and World War II BeginsWith Roosevelt’s decision to support Britain and France in the struggle against Germany and the other Axis Powers, defense manufacturing geared up, producing more and more private-sector jobs.The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to America’s entry into World War II, and the nation’s factories went back into full production mode.This expanding industrial production, as well as widespread conscription beginning in 1942, reduced the unemployment rate to below its pre-Depression level. The Great Depression had ended at last, and the United States turned its attention to the global conflict of World War II.Photo GalleriesIn the mid-1930s, the Farm Security Administration’s Resettlement Administration hired photographers to document the work done by the agency. Lange took this photo in New Mexico in 1935, noting, “It was conditions of this sort which forced many farmers to abandon the area.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationArthur Rothstein was one of the first photographers to join the Farm Security Administration. His most noteworthy contribution during his five years with FSA may have been this photograph, showing a (supposedly posed) farmer walking in the face of a dust storm with his sons in Oklahoma, 1936.Arthur Rothstein/Farm Security AdministrationOklahoma dust bowl refugees reach San Fernando, California in their overloaded vehicle in this 1935 FSA photo by Lange.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationMigrants from Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Mexico pick carrots on a California farm in 1937.

The beginning of World War II would finally turn migrants’ fortunes as many headed to cities to work in factories as part of the war effort.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationWalker Evans was among a handful of photographers hired by the Farm Security Administration to document the lives of farmers and the challenges of rural poverty from 1935–1944. Here, a farmer and mule team toil in a field near Tupelo, Mississippi.Getty ImagesThe black-and-white photos portion of Evans’ collection comprises about 175,000 film negatives, many of which showcase slice-of-life moments during the Great Depression, including this roadside food stand.Getty ImagesThis is a 1936 portrait of Floyd Burroughs, a cotton sharecropper, shot by Evans in Hale County, Alabama. The article later became the seminal book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” In it, Agee observes how household objects set apart from one another take on unique significance, with each object gaining “a full strength it would not otherwise have.”Getty ImagesShot on a large format film camera, this photo by Evans of houses in the African American quarters of Tupelo, Mississippi, highlight the meager living conditions Black Americans faced during the Great Depression.Getty ImagesWalker Evans shot this 1936 photo of Bud Fields sitting with his wife Ivy as she nurses their daughter Ellen in Hale County, Alabama. Evans lived with the family for a month while photographing their lives for what would later become “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.”Getty ImagesAllie Mae Burroughs, the wife of sharecropper Floyd Burroughs, photographed during the Great Depression.
