Yet peacekeeping faces several challenges such as protracted conflicts, elusive political solutions, increasingly dangerous environments, rising peacekeeping fatalities, and broad and complex mandates. To respond to these challenges, the Secretary-General launched Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) to refocus peacekeeping with more targeted mandates, make our operations stronger and safer, mobilize support for political solutions and better equipped and trained forces. A4P represents the core agenda for our action and is a driver of change permeating all aspects of UN's peacekeeping work.\nAdditional information can be obtained on the UN Peacekeeping website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“UN peacekeeping is a remarkable enterprise of multilateralism and international solidarity.

The A4P Declaration details 45 specific commitments. Some are from the UN Secretary-General on behalf of UN missions and the Secretariat; some are from Member States, on behalf of the Security Council, troop- and police- contributors, as well as host governments; others are of a collective nature. The UN Secretariat is progressing in fulfilling its commitments as outlined below. Member States are encouraged to support A4P by focusing on their commitments and working with the UN Secretariat on collective items.\nIn August 2019, the UN Department of Peace Operations carried out a survey to gather perceptions of progress in A4P implementation, and register concrete actions being taken by UN Peacekeeping stakeholders to implement the 45 commitments in the A4P Declaration. See the survey results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Politics\n\n\n\nAdvance political solutions to conflict and enhance the political impact of peacekeeping\n\nWe collectively commit to stronger engagement to advance political solutions to conflict and to pursue complementary political objectives and integrated strategies, including at national and regional levels, within our respective mandates and responsibilities. We affirm that the pursuit of sustainable political solutions should guide the design and deployment of UN peacekeeping operations. We recognize that lasting progress in strengthening security, national reconciliation, the rule of law, human rights and sustainable development needs to occur in parallel.\nTo fulfil the Secretariatâs commitments, we are developing country and regional political strategies to make our missions fit for purpose, including through analysis, data and approaches coordinated across the peace and security pillar, with a priority on prevention and sustaining peace.

Protection\n\n\n\nStrengthen the protection provided by peacekeeping operations\n\nWe collectively commit to support tailored, context-specific peacekeeping approaches to protecting civilians, in relevant peacekeeping operations, emphasising the protection of women and children in those contexts. We commit to implement protection of civilians mandates of peacekeeping missions, including through using all necessary means when required, in accordance with the UN Charter, mission mandates, and applicable international law. We further commit to improving strategic communications and engagement with local populations to strengthen the understanding of the peacekeeping missions and their mandates.\nTo fulfil the Secretariatâs commitments, we are putting strategic approaches to protection at the heart of mission actions; we are assessing more vigorously our military units on protection and are strengthening  coordinated approaches to community engagement in order to prevent, mitigate and respond more effectively to threats.

Performance and accountability\n\n\n\nSupport effective performance and accountability by all peacekeeping components\n\nWe collectively commit to ensuring the highest level of peacekeeping performance, and to hold all civilian and uniformed peacekeepers, particularly leadership, accountable for effective performance under common parameters while addressing performance shortfalls. The Secretary-General commits to develop an integrated performance policy framework based on clear standards for all actors, and to ensure that performance data is used to inform planning, evaluation, deployment decisions and reporting; to communicate to Member States all operational and technical requirements; to provide effective field support to peacekeeping operations, and to work with Member States to generate the necessary specialized capabilities, including language skills, while supporting new approaches to improve force generation, equipment serviceability and sustainability.\nTo fulfil the Secretariatâs commitments, we are developing an integrated performance policy framework and rolling out the Comprehensive Performance Assessment System which will help track performance and strengthen accountability; in the context of the Action Plan to Improve the Security of Peacekeepers, we are verifying the operational readiness of troops and police and engaging more actively with troops and police contributors on performance.

We commit to support the AU to strengthen and implement its policies, procedures and capacities, including on compliance. Recognising the Security Councilâs primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, we reaffirm the need to enhance the predictability, sustainability and flexibility of financing for AU-led peace support operations authorized by the Security Council, and under the Security Councilâs authority consistent with Chapter VIII of the UN Charter.\nTo fulfil the Secretariatâs commitments, we are strengthening the UN/African Union cooperation on political efforts, including via joint field visits and joint consultative mechanisms, as well as bolstering AU peace operations capacity.

To respond to these challenges, the Secretary-General launched Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) to refocus peacekeeping with more targeted mandates, make our operations stronger and safer, mobilize support for political solutions and better equipped and trained forces. Action by the Secretariat alone is not enough to meet the challenges we face.”\n\nAntÃ³nio Guterres\nUnited Nations Secretary-General\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThematic Areas of Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndorsements by Member States\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressions of Support (by regional organisations)\n\n\n\n\n\nEight areas of Improvement\nThe A4P initiative aims to strengthen peacekeeping by spurring collective action by all peacekeeping stakeholders, including all Member States, the Security Council, the General Assembly, financial contributors, troop and police contributing countries, host countries, intergovernmental and regional organizations and the UN Secretariat. Conduct of peacekeepers and peacekeeping operations\nStrengthen conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Road to Implementation\n\nAll peacekeeping stakeholders have a responsibility to strengthen peacekeeping. In August 2019, the UN Department of Peace Operations carried out a survey to gather perceptions of progress in A4P implementation, and register concrete actions being taken by UN Peacekeeping stakeholders to implement the 45 commitments in the A4P Declaration. Politics\n\n\n\nAdvance political solutions to conflict and enhance the political impact of peacekeeping\n\nWe collectively commit to stronger engagement to advance political solutions to conflict and to pursue complementary political objectives and integrated strategies, including at national and regional levels, within our respective mandates and responsibilities. Women, peace and security\n\n\n\nImplement the women, peace and security agenda \n\nWe collectively commit to implement the Women, Peace and Security agenda and its priorities by ensuring full, equal and meaningful participation of women in all stages of the peace process and by systematically integrating a gender perspective into all stages of analysis, planning, implementation and reporting. Protection\n\n\n\nStrengthen the protection provided by peacekeeping operations\n\nWe collectively commit to support tailored, context-specific peacekeeping approaches to protecting civilians, in relevant peacekeeping operations, emphasising the protection of women and children in those contexts.
