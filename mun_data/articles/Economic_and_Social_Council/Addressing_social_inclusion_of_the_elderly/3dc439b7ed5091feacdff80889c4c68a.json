We aim to reach the furthest behind first, so that everyone, everywhere is able to access the health and care and support services they need, regardless of age.\n\nCreating a society for all ages: We support older people to speak out, claim their rights and influence decisions that affect their lives.  \nActing on climate change: We recognise the impact that climate change has on older people and their communities, and the importance of addressing this issue in order to protect and improve their lives. \nAdvancing gender equality: We campaign to ensure that older people of all genders enjoy the same rights, responsibilities and opportunities.  \nProtecting the rights of older people: We advocate for the rights of older people and work to raise awareness about issues affecting them, such as age discrimination, elder abuse, and neglect. \nChallenging ageism: We challenge ageism so that older people are recognised as individuals and treated fairly and without discrimination.\n\nWhat we do\n\nWhat we do\n\nShare \n\n\n\n (opens in a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\n (opens in a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\n (opens in a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\n (opens in a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\n Copy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpAge International’s goal is to improve the lives of older women and men in low- and middle-income countries, especially those in crisis-prone and insecure areas.  \nOur mission is to empower older people to lead dignified, active, and healthy lives.  \nOur strategy, outlined in Strategy 2030, positions us as a global convenor, supporter, and thought leader for a network of partner organisations committed to promoting the dignity, wellbeing, and voice of older people worldwide.  \nSome of the key areas of work that we focus on are:  \n\nResponding to humanitarian crises: We respond to emergencies and crises around the world by providing essential aid and support to older people affected by conflict, disasters, and displacement. \nImproving income security: We work to ensure that older people have access to sustainable and adequate income, including through social protection programmes and livelihood support. \nSupporting healthy ageing: We work with network members and partners from grassroot to global levels to promote healthy ageing.
