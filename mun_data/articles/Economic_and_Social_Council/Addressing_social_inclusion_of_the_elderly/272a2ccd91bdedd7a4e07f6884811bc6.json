  "summary": "A large and rapidly growing number of older people are affected by humanitarian crises. Older people face numerous barriers that see them excluded from humanitarian response, including:\n\nFood distribution points can be difficult for older people to reach and food aid packages do not cater for older people’s particular nutritional requirements. Older people are often left-out of programmes to help people recover their livelihoods such as micro-credit (loan) schemes. Organisations often deliver a ‘one-size-fits all’ approach in response to humanitarian crises without understanding the specific barriers that older people face. We are seeking to change the humanitarian support system, making it more accountable and ensuring that older people are not excluded in the response. This includes:\n\n\nWorking with governments and international organisations to make sure older people are consulted and their needs addressed as part of all humanitarian work. Middle East crisis\n\nOlder people in Gaza and Lebanon face severe risks from conflict and displacement, and limited access to essential health services.
