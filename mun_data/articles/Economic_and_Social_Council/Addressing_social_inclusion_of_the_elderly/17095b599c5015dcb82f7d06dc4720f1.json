With such a small fraction of gender-focused aid reaching them, the international community is overlooking the lived realities of millions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder women: a growing, overlooked population \nBy 2050, women over 50 will make up 34.7 per cent of the world’s female population (currently they represent 27 per cent).  \nYet their needs remain largely invisible in policy and funding, and they are systematically excluded from gender equality initiatives, leaving them vulnerable and under-supported. \nFor many, old age brings poverty. Decades of unpaid caregiving, informal work, and pervasive gender discrimination leave older women with little to no savings, and they often lack access to pensions.  \nThe result? Millions of older women are forced to continue working, often in harsh conditions, just to survive and support their households \n“The mere thought of sickness terrifies me,” shares a 60-year-old woman from Lebanon. “We do not have any social safety net, healthcare, or protection. Who would care for our fate? The government is nowhere to be found.” \nHer story is the reality for countless women. \n \nThe shocking funding gap \nHelpAge’s analysis reveals an alarming truth: of the 7,231 projects reported by OECD-DAC members in 2021 to promote gender equality, only 16—just 0.2%—explicitly included older women. These projects accounted for a mere 0.1% of total gender equality aid. \nThis statistic isn’t just a number—it’s a significant gap in global attention. Almost two-thirds of the donors did not fund a single project that addressed older women.  \nThis lack of attention is nothing short of a crisis. As older women continue to suffer from the compounded effects of gender inequality and age discrimination, the international community’s inaction highlights the urgent need for change.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Equality\n\nWomen over the age of 50 account for 27 per cent of the world’s women and yet they are almost entirely invisible within debates on gender equality.\nInternational aid providers play a key role in making sure gender equality efforts include women of all ages.\nBut our report shows that older women are often left out. There are significant gaps in how their rights and needs are addressed in current donor spending on gender equality.\n\nAccess the report here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonor priorities must change \nThe data is clear: donor priorities must change. A failure to invest in older women is a failure to achieve true gender equality. \nThe international community has the power—and the responsibility—to address this gap. It is crucial for donors to  adopt an all-ages approach, ensuring that policies and programmes include older women through both mainstreaming and targeted initiatives. \nWithout urgent action, the gender equality agenda will remain incomplete. As the world ages, older women cannot afford to be left behind. The global community must refocus its efforts on empowering women at every stage of life. \n \nA call to action \nHelpAge proposes the following recommendations: \n\nTo donors: strengthen understanding of, and attention to, risks facing older women through donor programming and in donor policy frameworks.  \nTo donors and international agencies: using their positions in global, regional and national fora to support and amplify older women’s voices in global development efforts and strengthen global efforts with regards to older women  \nTo multilateral agencies: supporting with the tools and coordination needed to drive and track action. \n\nThe time to act is now. With older women making up a growing share of the global population, donors must recognise that gender equality cannot be achieved without them. Aid must reflect this reality – starting today. \n \nOlder women deserve better.

Investing in Equality\n\nHelpAge International’s report, Investing in Equality – Addressing the Funding Gap for Older Women, exposes an alarming finding: only 0.1 per cent of aid focused on gender equality specifically includes older women. HelpAge International’s report, Investing in Equality – Addressing the Funding Gap for Older Women, exposes an alarming finding: only 0.1 per cent of aid focused on gender equality specifically includes older women. Of the US$ 5.7 billion of aid spent on gender equality projects, a mere US$ 7.8 million includes older women. Older women: a growing, overlooked population \nBy 2050, women over 50 will make up 34.7 per cent of the world’s female population (currently they represent 27 per cent). The shocking funding gap \nHelpAge’s analysis reveals an alarming truth: of the 7,231 projects reported by OECD-DAC members in 2021 to promote gender equality, only 16—just 0.2%—explicitly included older women. Investing in Equality\n\nWomen over the age of 50 account for 27 per cent of the world’s women and yet they are almost entirely invisible within debates on gender equality. To donors and international agencies: using their positions in global, regional and national fora to support and amplify older women’s voices in global development efforts and strengthen global efforts with regards to older women  \nTo multilateral agencies: supporting with the tools and coordination needed to drive and track action. With older women making up a growing share of the global population, donors must recognise that gender equality cannot be achieved without them.
