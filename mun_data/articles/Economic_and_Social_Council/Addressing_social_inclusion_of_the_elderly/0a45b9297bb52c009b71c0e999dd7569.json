Yet countries are not passing and putting into practice laws to ensure their populations are entitled to access health services. This underpins the fact that at least 4.5 billion people — more than half of the world’s population — were not fully covered by essential health services in 2021.To address these types of challenges, the theme for World Health Day 2024 is 'My health, my right’.This year’s theme was chosen to champion the right of everyone, everywhere to have access to quality health services, education, and information, as well as safe drinking water, clean air, good nutrition, quality housing, decent working and environmental conditions, and freedom from discrimination. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 April 2024\nWorld Health Day 2024: My health, my right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 April 2024\n\nNews release\n\n\nWHO calls for action to uphold right to health amidst inaction, injustice and crises\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaign assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO Director-General's message\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights fact sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRealizing the right to health in a world in turmoil\n\n\n\n\r\n                            8 April 2024 | High-level dialogue\r\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth is a human right\n\n\n\n\r\n                            19 December 2023 | Poster\r\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocio-political determinants\n\n\nHuman rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender Equality, Human Rights & Health Equity\n\nWorld Health Day 2024\n\n\n\n\nAround the world, the right to health of millions is increasingly coming under threat.Diseases and disasters loom large as causes of death and disability.Conflicts are devastating lives, causing death, pain, hunger and psychological distress.The burning of fossil fuels is simultaneously driving the climate crisis and taking away our right to breathe clean air, with indoor and outdoor air pollution claiming a life every 5 seconds.The WHO Council on the Economics of Health for All has found that at least 140 countries recognize health as a human right in their constitution.
