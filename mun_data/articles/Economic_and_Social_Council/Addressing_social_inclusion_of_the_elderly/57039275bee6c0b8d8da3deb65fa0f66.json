It presents the most up to date, internationally-comparable estimates of maternal deaths at global, regional, and country levels.\nIn 2023, an estimated 260,000 maternal deaths occurred worldwide, equivalent to 712 deaths each day. This marks a 40% reduction in maternal mortality since 2000, reflecting sustained global efforts to improve access to essential health services. For the first time, no country was estimated to have an extremely high maternal mortality ratio (MMR), and no region was classified as having a very high MMR.\nDespite these gains, disparities remain stark. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 70% of global maternal deaths, with Central and Southern Asia contributing nearly 17%. In 2023, 37 countries were classified as being in conflict or experiencing institutional or social fragility, yet they accounted for 64% of global maternal deaths.\nWhile maternal mortality spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, levels have since returned to pre-pandemic trends. However, current progress is insufficient to meet the Sustainable Development Goal of fewer than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.

In 2023, 37 countries were classified as being in conflict or experiencing institutional or social fragility, yet they accounted for 64% of global maternal deaths.\n\nWhile maternal mortality spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, levels have since returned to pre-pandemic trends. However, current progress is insufficient to meet the Sustainable Development Goal of fewer than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. The report calls for urgent, targeted investments to accelerate progress and ensure all women have access to the care they need.\n\nRelated topics\n\n\n\n\nMaternal health\n\nRelated topics\n\n\n\n\nMaternal health\n\nRelated topics\n\n\n\n\nMaternal health\n\nRelated topics\n\n\n\n\nMaternal health\n\nMaternal health\n\nMaternal health\n\nMaternal health\n\nBack to page\n    \n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nBack to page\n\nBack to page\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nPublications\n\nPublications\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nWorld Health Day\n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nImproving health and well-being for women and newborns: Launch of the Midwifery…\n\nRead more\n\nEvents\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nPublications\n\nThe Midwifery Accelerator: expanding health care for women and newborns \n\nRead more\n\nPublications\n\nWe use cookies and other identifiers to help improve your online experience.
