Where economies are focused on health and well-being? Where cities are liveable and people have control over their health and the health of the planet?  \r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In the midst of a pandemic, a polluted planet, increasing diseases like cancer, asthma, heart disease, on World Health Day 2022, WHO will focus global attention on urgent actions needed to keep humans and the planet healthy and foster a movement to create\r\n societies focused on well-being.   WHO estimates that more than 13 million deaths around the world each year are due to avoidable environmental causes. This includes the climate crisis which is the single biggest health threat facing humanity.

Extreme weather events, land degradation and water scarcity are displacing people and affecting their health. Pollution and plastics are found at the bottom of our deepest oceans, the highest mountains, and have made their way into our food chain.

The pandemic has revealed weaknesses in all areas of society and underlined the urgency of creating sustainable well-being societies committed to achieving equitable health now and for future generations without breaching ecological limits. The present design of the economy leads to inequitable distribution of income, wealth and power, with too many people still living in poverty and instability. A well-being economy has human well-being, equity and ecological sustainability as its goals. These goals are translated into long-term investments, well-being budgets, social protection and legal and fiscal strategies. Breaking these cycles of destruction for the planet and human health requires legislative action, corporate reform and individuals to be supported and incentivized to make healthy choices.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 August 2020\nWHO Manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 April 2022\nLet's reimagine a world where clean air, water and food are available to all: join our Q&A ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#HealthierTomorrow\n\n\n\nThrough the Our planet, our health campaign, WHO will urge governments and the public to share stories of steps they are taking to protect the planet and their health and prioritize well-being societies.\n\n\nDownload campaign toolkit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \r\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReimagine your world\n\n\n#HealthierTomorrow\n\n\n\nRecommended actions for governments, mayors, corporations, health facilities, workers and individuals.\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\nClimate crisis is a health crisis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 October 2021\nClimate change is making floods more dangerous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 October 2021\nRising temperatures harm our health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21 October 2021\nClimate change makes wildfires more likely\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfographic\nFloods can cause poisoning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfographic\nFloods can cause shortages of safe water\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfographic\nExposure to extreme heat causes headaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfographic\nAbove 40 degrees, heat strokes might happen, causing organ failure and even death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfographic\nWildfires can cause death and injury from suffocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfographic\nWildfires can cause trauma impacts on mental health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast facts on climate and health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir pollution impacts our health and the planet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 February 2022\nBreatheLife - How air pollution impacts your body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19 March 2021\nClean Household Energy For Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience in 5 : Air pollution, a public health emergency\n\nWatch full episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow air pollution is destroying our health\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n\n\nTobacco kills humans and pollutes the planet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 February 2022\nThe Secretariat of the WHO FCTC is delighted to participate in the UNEP Clean Seas Campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 February 2022\nTobacco has a negative impact on the environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 March 2022\nA smoke-free future for Milan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco and environment\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n\n\nHealth for all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 December 2021\nTracking Universal Health Coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 June 2020\nA healthy diet, a healthier world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 March 2022\nWhat would a world without chronic diseases be like in 2040?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 April 2022\nPrimary health care: health systems, communities and the planet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nAlmigdad Aldikhaiiry\r\n                    Tribulations Influx (detail), 2021.
