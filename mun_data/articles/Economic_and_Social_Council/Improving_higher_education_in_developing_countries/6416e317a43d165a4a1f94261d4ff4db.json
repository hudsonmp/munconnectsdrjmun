  "text": "In a landmark move, Serbia has announced significant reforms to its higher education system, promising a brighter future for both educators and students. These changes, hailed as a victory for teacher unions and student activists, mark a pivotal moment in the country's educational landscape.Historic agreement on Higher Education Law amendmentsAna Brnabić, the President of the National Assembly, revealed on February 23rd that an agreement has been reached on amendments to the Higher Education Law. These amendments will see a 20% increase in the budget for higher education, amounting to approximately 12 billion dinars (around 102,360,000 euros). This boost in funding is set to transform the sector, meeting the demands of both students and educators.Tuition fee reduction: A win for studentsOne of the most significant changes is the reduction of tuition fees by 50%. Students will receive a direct refund from the budget, making higher education more accessible to a broader range of social groups. This move is expected to alleviate the financial burden on students and their families, ensuring that education remains a right, not a privilege.Increased funding and salary adjustments for educatorsHigher education institutions will also benefit from increased funding to cover operational costs and salaries. Salaries in higher education will be aligned with those in primary and secondary education, resulting in a 16% increase. This adjustment is a long-awaited victory for educators, who have been advocating for fairer wages and better working conditions.Union efforts recognizedMarina Milenkovic, Vice-President of the Teachers Union of Serbia (TUS) Committee for Higher Education, praised the amendments as a direct result of persistent union efforts. “With the adoption of the changes of the Law on Higher Education in the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia on March 6th, 2025, and its publication in the Official Gazette on the same day, the implementation of provisions that significantly improve the status of higher education in Serbia will begin,” she stated.Milenkovic further emphasized: “Long-standing demands for resolving the growing issues in higher education, advocated by both trade unions and representatives of higher education institutions, have been addressed in this Law, as a response to one of the demands of students who have been blocking the operations of higher education institutions for several months”.A call to save the academic yearAlongside these positive changes, Brnabić urged universities and students to return to teaching and save the academic year. With the academic year at risk due to ongoing blockades, she emphasized the importance of resuming classes to avoid jeopardizing the future of over 230,000 students.A step towards greater university autonomyThe amendments also ensure greater university autonomy by reducing the percentage of government-appointed representatives in faculty councils from 30% to 25%, while the percentage of employee representatives increases from 55% to 60%, and the percentage of student representatives remains the same at 15%, Milenkovic noted. The term of governing bodies is also shortened from four to three years. This change is expected to enhance the governance of higher education institutions, allowing for more democratic decision-making processes.The TUS leader added that the preparation of the amendments to the Higher Education Law was coordinated with representatives of the relevant ministries of the Government of the Republic of Serbia (education and finance) and representatives of all eight state universities in Serbia. “The amendment proposers believe that the provisions of the law will enhance the quality of higher education, improve accessibility, relevance, and further internationalization of education, and, most importantly, significantly improve the material status of employees.”Massive rally in Niš: A call for justice and rule of lawOn March 1st, tens of thousands of people gathered in Niš for a huge student-led rally. The rally vowed to turn the Balkan country into a free nation of justice and rule of law, while sending a powerful message that “We deserve better”.Solidarity from the European education union movementEuropean Trade Union Committee for Education (ETUCE) Director Jelmer Evers warmly welcomed these recent steps in the Serbian higher education system.“This is a big step forward for higher education in Serbia.
