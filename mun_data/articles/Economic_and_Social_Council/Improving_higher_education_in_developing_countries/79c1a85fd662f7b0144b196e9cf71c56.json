  "text": "The Education International Asia-Pacific Regional Committee met from 5- 6 March 2025 in Bangkok, Thailand to review the progress made over the past year and a half, and to set regional priorities in line with the resolutions of the 10th Education International World Congress.The meeting was attended by Mugwena Maluleke, the newly elected EI President from South Africa and by David Edwards, General Secretary of EI, joined by EI cooperation partners.Maluleke acknowledged the vital work of EI member organisations in the Asia-Pacific as well as the work of the EIAP regional office. He urged members to reflect on key questions including on the lessons learnt, on enhancing community engagement in advocacy, and on ensuring governments prioritise education funding despite competing priorities.The Committee Chairperson, Tsukasa Takimoto, underscored the escalating threats to democracy, labour rights, and human rights, stressing the need for solidarity among education trade unions across the globe.EI Regional Director’s progress reportIn his report to the Regional Committee, Regional Director Anand Singh stressed that Asia-Pacific is a very wide and diverse region, with growing concerns over worsening labour rights. Current cases in Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Myanmar are particularly worrying. The second edition of EIAP's flagship report “The status of education personnel in the Asia-Pacific” will be released in October 2025 with the aim to inform and to track violations of human and trade union rights in the education sector. The committee also reaffirmed its commitment to education for sustainable development, emphasizing the importance of integrating climate education in the curriculum.Defending rights and democracyMembers of the EI Asia-Pacific Regional Committee raised concerns over increasing threats to teachers, education institutions and their rights. Myanmar, still struggling with the recognition of the NUG government, continues to ensure that education services are not disrupted and that students and teachers are learning and teaching. The constitutional crisis in South Korea, the ongoing harassment of teacher unionists in the Philippines, and the election of Trump in the USA have put many lives in danger, undermining fundamental human rights. EI General Secretary David Edwards reaffirmed global support and solidarity with unions operating within hostile environments and facing continuous oppression.Strengthening the teaching professionIn his opening remarks, chairperson Tsukasa Takimoto (Japan Teachers’ Union) underscored the need to ensure that all children have a safe and bright future. He went on to note: “Sisters and brothers, demands on teachers are becoming increasingly complex, and teacher shortages persist across almost all countries. Now more than ever, we must fight for improved status and working conditions for teachers.”Joining virtually, EI Vice-President Takashi Kajiwara highlighted the importance of ensuring that EI’s newly adopted strategic plan responds to the urgency of translating global commitments into national action.“Global and domestic issues are deeply interlinked,” he said. “The UN High-Level Panel’s recommendations on the teaching profession must be implemented in our countries without delay. I urge all of you to continue fighting for our profession, for public education, for our people, and for our planet.”Education unions mobilise for the ‘Go Public! Fund Education’ campaignThe committee reaffirmed its commitment and support for the expansion of the \"Go Public!
