Lake Turkana, the world’s largest desert lake, holds much promise for these communities—but its resources must be managed sustainably.17 March 2025Last update:25 March 2025Since losing most of his livestock in a recent drought, herder Angelech Losoro has traded the parched lands of northwestern Kenya for the waters of nearby Lake Turkana, where he now makes a living catching fish.Between 2021 and 2023, Kenya faced its worst drought in 40 years. In Turkana County alone, more than 200,000 pastoralists like Losoro abandoned their way of life: “I said to myself, instead of dying in this place, let me go to (the lake) and give it a shot.”Lake Turkana, the world’s largest permanent desert lake and a UNESCO World Heritage site, offers hope. It produced 17,300 metric tonnes of fish in recent years, and could produce considerably more, according to a recent study by the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute commissioned by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and coordinated by UNESCO.          Former pastor Angelech Losoro fishes in Lake Turkana.© WFP/Fredrik LernerydHowever, challenges remain. As the number of pastoralists switching to fishing climbs, competition for dwindling resources could lead to conflicts between communities. Fishers also face difficulties in transporting their catch, which perishes quickly, to potential customers. The WFP and UNESCO, in collaboration with the Marsabit and Turkana County Governments, are launching a new programme to sustainably unlock the lake's economic potential for those living along its shores.          Mother of six Paulina Ekuuta prepares fish bought from from boats along the shores of Lake Turkana, but has to throw away whatever is unsold at the end of the day.© WFP/Fredrik LernerydThe five-year programme, financed by the Kingdom of the Netherlands with additional funding from the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, supports the entire value chain, from lake to plate.We need to ensure that every family in this community benefits from this project, not just in the short term, but for generations to come. By doing so, we can create a sustainable future for Lake Turkana and its people.Louise HaxthausenDirector of UNESCO’s Regional Office for Eastern AfricaThis starts with ensuring the lake remains healthy, by promoting sustainable fishing practices and managing water resources effectively. UNESCO’s scientific and technical expertise is essential in this regard.For instance, to better understand fish stocks, UNESCO is gathering data on catches and fish biomass through surveys repeated over several years. Initial findings have revealed the presence of large amounts of small pelagic fish—which are both nutritious and easy to process, being simply dried in the sun.Building on WFP’s existing work around the lake’s shores, the programme will also expand solar-powered cold storage and solar drying facilities, and train communities in better fish handling and processing techniques, allowing them to fetch higher prices and reach markets further away. 0 nextchevron_leftpreviouschevron_right         Former pastoralist Angelech Losoro fishes in Lake Turkana.© WFP/Fredrik Lerneryd         © WFP/Fredrik Lerneryd         Paulina Ekuuta stands on the shores of Lake Turkana after buying fish from local fisherman.

When communities have access to well managed resources and opportunities, conflict is less likely to take hold.”The programme will therefore equip fisherfolk, especially women and youth, with business development skills to access bigger markets and finance.  And, recognizing that a healthy community depends on a healthy diet, the programme aims to reduce local malnutrition rates, which are among the highest in the country, by encouraging people to include more protein-rich fish in their meals.In all these efforts, cooperation is key—because ambitious goals cannot be achieved by acting alone. The WFP, UNESCO and the Marsabit and Turkana County Governments will therefore collaborate closely with development partners, the private sector and local communities. In this way, the programme aims to unlock the true potential of Lake Turkana—and transform local lives and livelihoods in the long term.

In Turkana County alone, more than 200,000 pastoralists like Losoro abandoned their way of life: “I said to myself, instead of dying in this place, let me go to (the lake) and give it a shot.”Lake Turkana, the world’s largest permanent desert lake and a UNESCO World Heritage site, offers hope. It produced 17,300 metric tonnes of fish in recent years, and could produce considerably more, according to a recent study by the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute commissioned by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and coordinated by UNESCO.          Former pastor Angelech Losoro fishes in Lake Turkana.© WFP/Fredrik LernerydHowever, challenges remain. As the number of pastoralists switching to fishing climbs, competition for dwindling resources could lead to conflicts between communities. Fishers also face difficulties in transporting their catch, which perishes quickly, to potential customers. The WFP and UNESCO, in collaboration with the Marsabit and Turkana County Governments, are launching a new programme to sustainably unlock the lake's economic potential for those living along its shores.          Mother of six Paulina Ekuuta prepares fish bought from from boats along the shores of Lake Turkana, but has to throw away whatever is unsold at the end of the day.© WFP/Fredrik LernerydThe five-year programme, financed by the Kingdom of the Netherlands with additional funding from the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, supports the entire value chain, from lake to plate.We need to ensure that every family in this community benefits from this project, not just in the short term, but for generations to come. By doing so, we can create a sustainable future for Lake Turkana and its people.Louise HaxthausenDirector of UNESCO’s Regional Office for Eastern AfricaThis starts with ensuring the lake remains healthy, by promoting sustainable fishing practices and managing water resources effectively. UNESCO’s scientific and technical expertise is essential in this regard.For instance, to better understand fish stocks, UNESCO is gathering data on catches and fish biomass through surveys repeated over several years. Initial findings have revealed the presence of large amounts of small pelagic fish—which are both nutritious and easy to process, being simply dried in the sun.Building on WFP’s existing work around the lake’s shores, the programme will also expand solar-powered cold storage and solar drying facilities, and train communities in better fish handling and processing techniques, allowing them to fetch higher prices and reach markets further away. 0 nextchevron_leftpreviouschevron_right         Former pastoralist Angelech Losoro fishes in Lake Turkana.© WFP/Fredrik Lerneryd         © WFP/Fredrik Lerneryd         Paulina Ekuuta stands on the shores of Lake Turkana after buying fish from local fisherman.

When communities have access to well managed resources and opportunities, conflict is less likely to take hold.”The programme will therefore equip fisherfolk, especially women and youth, with business development skills to access bigger markets and finance.  And, recognizing that a healthy community depends on a healthy diet, the programme aims to reduce local malnutrition rates, which are among the highest in the country, by encouraging people to include more protein-rich fish in their meals.In all these efforts, cooperation is key—because ambitious goals cannot be achieved by acting alone. The WFP, UNESCO and the Marsabit and Turkana County Governments will therefore collaborate closely with development partners, the private sector and local communities. In this way, the programme aims to unlock the true potential of Lake Turkana—and transform local lives and livelihoods in the long term.

UNESCO’s scientific and technical expertise is essential in this regard.For instance, to better understand fish stocks, UNESCO is gathering data on catches and fish biomass through surveys repeated over several years. Initial findings have revealed the presence of large amounts of small pelagic fish—which are both nutritious and easy to process, being simply dried in the sun.Building on WFP’s existing work around the lake’s shores, the programme will also expand solar-powered cold storage and solar drying facilities, and train communities in better fish handling and processing techniques, allowing them to fetch higher prices and reach markets further away.\n\nThis starts with ensuring the lake remains healthy, by promoting sustainable fishing practices and managing water resources effectively.

When communities have access to well managed resources and opportunities, conflict is less likely to take hold.”The programme will therefore equip fisherfolk, especially women and youth, with business development skills to access bigger markets and finance.  And, recognizing that a healthy community depends on a healthy diet, the programme aims to reduce local malnutrition rates, which are among the highest in the country, by encouraging people to include more protein-rich fish in their meals.In all these efforts, cooperation is key—because ambitious goals cannot be achieved by acting alone.
