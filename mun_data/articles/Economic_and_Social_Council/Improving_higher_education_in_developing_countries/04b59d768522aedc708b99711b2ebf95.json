  "text": "The Executive Board of Education International (EI) during its 70th meeting, on 1-3 April, reaffirmed the central role of inclusive education in building just and equitable societies.As the Global Disability Summit is taking place in Berlin (2-3 April), with the active participation of Education International and several of our members, we reiterate that inclusive education is not only a fundamental human right but also an essential pillar for the development of prosperous communities and societies.We believe that this right is most effectively upheld through a social model of disability, which focuses on how societal barriers, rather than individual impairments, prevent full participation.Education International highlighted the significance of this model at the 10th World Congress and emphasized the urgent need for inclusive educational policies that address the diverse needs of all educators and learners, including those with disabilities. Globally, education unions play a key role in removing barriers, not only through organising educators – including those with disabilities – but also promoting inclusive policies that are both relevant and effective.This is crucial in a time of a global teacher shortage and funding cuts that worsen the provision of inclusive education and programs that support children with disabilities and their families.Teachers with disabilities encounter barriers, especially those from marginalized populations, to access accessible workplaces, decent working conditions and training, yet they are vital role models and leaders in advancing inclusive practices. Similarly, the provision of inclusive education is at risk when specialized teachers and education support personnel, who play a key role in removing barriers for students with disabilities, are unavailable or do not receive adequate and quality training.The appalling attacks by the Trump administration in the United States, on vital programs that support students with disabilities, and his cynical dismantling of any program that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion, is call of alarm heard beyond the U.S. borders.  These policies risk reversing progress with already felt significant global consequences for the development of inclusive education and societies more broadly.EI remains steadfast in its commitment to opposing such regressive policies and reaffirming our global commitment to human rights, equity, and inclusion. Every student has the right to be supported by education support personnel and taught by teachers that are qualified, trained and well-supported and every student has the right to learn in an environment that respects their dignity and potential.In line with EI's   Go Public! Fund Education campaign, we call for increased investment in education, education support personnel and the teaching profession to recruit and retain teachers essential for achieving inclusive education for all.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Unions demand that humanitarian aid reaches Myanmar’s people, not the military junta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution of the Executive Board of Education International on the attacks on public education, democracy, and union values in the United States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTackling the teacher shortage crisis in the Commonwealth\n\nThe Executive Board of Education International (EI) during its 70th meeting, on 1-3 April, reaffirmed the central role of inclusive education in building just and equitable societies.As the Global Disability Summit is taking place in Berlin (2-3 April), with the active participation of Education International and several of our members, we reiterate that inclusive education is not only a fundamental human right but also an essential pillar for the development of prosperous communities and societies.We believe that this right is most effectively upheld through a social model of disability, which focuses on how societal barriers, rather than individual impairments, prevent full participation.Education International highlighted the significance of this model at the 10th World Congress and emphasized the urgent need for inclusive educational policies that address the diverse needs of all educators and learners, including those with disabilities.
