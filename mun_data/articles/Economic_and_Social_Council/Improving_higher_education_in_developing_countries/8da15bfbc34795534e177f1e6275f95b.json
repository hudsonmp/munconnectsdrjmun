Education International played a critical role in securing a stand-alone goal for education - Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4): Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Significantly, SDG4 recognised that quality education can only be delivered by qualified teachers.However, at the current pace, governments will fail to achieve SDG 4. The COVID-19 pandemic poses additional challenges, and risks reversing years of progress on education. Urgent and decisive action is imperative.Together with our member organisations around the world we are working to ensure that governments live up to their promise to achieve SDG 4 and all its targets by 2030.We monitor progress and hold governments accountable.We advocate for enhanced domestic financing for public education through fair and progressive taxation and international aid.We oppose corporate interests that treat education as a market instead of a public good accessible to all.We promote quality education that is free from violence, develops the “whole child”, builds tolerance, understanding, democracy, respect for human rights and active citizenship for sustainable development.We promote the achievement of the “teacher target” (target 4.c), underlining every students’ right to be taught by a trained and qualified teacher.\n\n\nOur work in this area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Executive Board of Education International (EI) during its 70th meeting, on 1-3 April, reaffirmed the central role of inclusive education in building just and equitable societies.\nStatement of the Executive Board of Education International on the Global Disability Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44 million teachers\n are need globally by 2030 – a shortage that affects developing and developed countries alike, as demonstrated across the Commonwealth.\nTackling the teacher shortage crisis in the Commonwealth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a bid to address the critical shortage of teachers and improve the state of education in the country, the Jamaica Teachers’ Association (JTA) launched the Go Public!
