So why is it that a third of the world’s population can’t afford a healthy diet?\nThe straightforward answer is that global food systems are not working. What we grow, and how we grow and consume it, isn’t working – both for the 148 million children under 5 who are stunted due to chronic undernutrition, and for the 390 million aged 5–19 who are overweight or obese. More than half the global population doesn’t get enough micronutrients for a healthy life. \nWhat can be done? Let’s explore the answers.\nWhy invest in nourishing the world?\nThe answer may seem obvious, as the right to food is a universal human right. We owe it to each other to make sure everyone in the world has enough nutritious food, not only to survive, but to thrive. \nBetter nutrition also leads to better health, educational achievement and earnings for individuals and communities. Every US$1 invested in nutrition generates US$23 in returns.\nGetting these returns isn’t just a matter of cultivating more – we need diverse, high-quality and nutritious food.\nThis means producing food now in a way that doesn’t harm the planet in the future. It means rethinking our food systems to respect and conserve water and soil, the building blocks of nutritious food. And it means building sustainable, productive and equitable food chains, in which producers are fairly recompensed and food travels safely from farm to plate.\nHow can we nourish the world – now and in the future?\nThe solution is local. Investing in small-scale agriculture and local food systems in low and middle-income countries is the best way to create nutritional security for all. That is why nutrition is at the heart of IFAD’s rural investments, and that is why 60 per cent of our projects for 2025–2027 are nutrition-sensitive.\nHere are five crucial investments we have identified, through our work with rural people in low and middle-income countries, to support sustainable nutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Diversify our food baskets\n\n\n\n\nThere are about 5,000 food crops, yet more than half of our calories come from rice, wheat or maize. By cultivating neglected and under-utilized species like millet, fonio or teff, small-scale farmers can supply diverse and nutritious foods. These are sometimes called forgotten foods – or, as we prefer to call them, foods of the future. \nIn Malawi, farmers are growing millet, cowpeas and sorghum using local seeds. These nutritious staples mature early and provide food during the lean season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In Malawi, a woman prepares khobwe balls made from purple cowpeas. © IFAD/Kondwani Jere \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Explore agroecology\n\n\n\n\nSmall-scale farms are hotbeds of biodiversity. Using agroecology, smaller farms conserve natural resources while maintaining more biodiversity than larger ones, with richer soil and water leading to more nutritious crops. They often integrate animals, from livestock to fish, so that nutrients are not wasted.\nSixty per cent of IFAD projects completed between 2018 and 2023 implemented agroecological practices, strengthening food systems while adapting to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Invest in nutrition-sensitive value chains\n\n\n\n\nBy accessing value chains and connecting to markets, farmers earn better incomes to feed their own families. As part of nutrition-sensitive value chains, small enterprises provide inputs and technology, enhance the availability, affordability, diversity, safety and acceptability of nutritious foods, and reduce food losses. When small and medium-size rural enterprises (SMEs) flourish, so do rural producers and consumers.\nOver a quarter of IFAD project finance is invested in value chains, strengthening and integrating nutrition at every step, from production, processing and packaging to transportation, markets and consumers. In Nigeria, IFAD support enabled women like Cynthia to produce vitamin-A-fortified cassava seed and set up plants to process the cassava into garri for the local market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cynthia, a cassava seed entrepreneur, looks on as employees process garri from cassava root in the facility she recently established. © IFAD/Andrew Esiebo \n\n\n\n\n\n4. Nourish kids at school\n\n\n\n\nSchool meal programmes can be designed to prepare locally grown nutritious food for children. From Tajikistan to Guatemala, IFAD supports schools in sourcing nutritious foods from local farmers and cultivating school gardens, coupled with nutrition education, to give children the best possible start to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Teach family nutrition\n\n\n\n\nObesity and overweight are growing faster in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Amid the ever-increasing availability of cheap but unhealthy foods that are highly processed and high in fat, sugar and salt, nutrition education helps people make the right food choices. In Laos, IFAD-supported Farmer Nutrition Schools are teaching parents to prepare healthier and tastier food for their children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's stopping us from nourishing the world?\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in small-scale agriculture in low and middle-income countries is an investment in nourishing, sustainable food systems for generations to come. Yet nutrition accounts for under 1 per cent of overseas development assistance, and agriculture for 5–6 per cent. There is a food systems funding gap of US$300–400 billion a year.\nIt's high time that low and middle-income countries receive the support they need to boost nutrition and agricultural production alike – and one of the best ways to achieve this is through concessional financing, coupled with technical assistance, from international financial institutions like IFAD.\nInnovative financial instruments can help minimize risks while pooling public, private and philanthropic funds. In Uganda, private investors in the IFAD-supported Yield Fund supported SMEs like Pristine Foods Ltd., the first producer of high-protein egg powder in East Africa, which sources eggs from small-scale chicken farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition bonds can also channel private sector investment. In 2024, IFAD issued its first nutrition bond, raising US$50 million.\n\nAs the extent of the global nutrition crisis becomes clear, governments, private actors, rural communities and development agencies are coming to realize that the solution is in our hands. To nourish the world, we need to invest funds, knowledge and empowerment in rural people and small-scale producers, who are the key to the sustainable food systems of the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep exploring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRural Voices\n\n Soil is getting saltier – but African farmers are standing strong Farmers in western and southern Africa are building resilience to salinity through innovative approaches in their fields. \n\n  Read now \n             \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRural Voices\n\n Forest bounty feeds the world Meet some of the rural people that IFAD works with to celebrate and nurture the bounty of our forests. \n\n  Read now \n             \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRural Voices\n\n Investment from Malians abroad supports farmers back home Overseas Malians are exploring ways to invest in businesses that yield both societal impact and financial returns – and agriculture is high on the priority list. \n\n  Read now \n             \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Please configure the desktop menu widget below\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n About IFAD \n Who we are   Where we work   What we do   Action Areas   Knowledge & Data \n\n\n For Member States \n Member States interactive platform \n\n\n For Investors \n Investors   Finance \n\n\n For Job seekers \n Work with us   Frequently Asked Questions \n\n\n For Media \n News   Media Contacts   Image Bank \n\n\n Get Involved \n Join an event   Rural Voices   Opinions & Insights \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Please configure the mobile menu widget below\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Who we are \n\n\n\n What we do \n\n\n\n Where we work \n\n\n\n Action Areas \n\n\n\n Knowledge & Data \n\n\n\n Get Involved \n\n\n\n News and Stories \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n Legal  Privacy notice  Fraudulent job offers  Contact us Connect with us\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden\n\n5 investments that will help nourish the world - IFAD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n IFAD \n News and Stories \n Stories \n Explainers \n 5 investments that will help nourish the world \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplainer | 26 March 2025\n\n5 investments that will help nourish the world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Estimated reading time: 4 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n   Nutrition       Food systems       Crops   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           LINK COPIED\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a world of 8.2 billion people, we grow enough food to feed 10 billion.

So why is it that a third of the world’s population can’t afford a healthy diet?\nThe straightforward answer is that global food systems are not working. What we grow, and how we grow and consume it, isn’t working – both for the 148 million children under 5 who are stunted due to chronic undernutrition, and for the 390 million aged 5–19 who are overweight or obese. More than half the global population doesn’t get enough micronutrients for a healthy life. \nWhat can be done? Let’s explore the answers.\nWhy invest in nourishing the world?\nThe answer may seem obvious, as the right to food is a universal human right. We owe it to each other to make sure everyone in the world has enough nutritious food, not only to survive, but to thrive. \nBetter nutrition also leads to better health, educational achievement and earnings for individuals and communities. Every US$1 invested in nutrition generates US$23 in returns.\nGetting these returns isn’t just a matter of cultivating more – we need diverse, high-quality and nutritious food.\nThis means producing food now in a way that doesn’t harm the planet in the future. It means rethinking our food systems to respect and conserve water and soil, the building blocks of nutritious food. And it means building sustainable, productive and equitable food chains, in which producers are fairly recompensed and food travels safely from farm to plate.\nHow can we nourish the world – now and in the future?\nThe solution is local. Investing in small-scale agriculture and local food systems in low and middle-income countries is the best way to create nutritional security for all. That is why nutrition is at the heart of IFAD’s rural investments, and that is why 60 per cent of our projects for 2025–2027 are nutrition-sensitive.\nHere are five crucial investments we have identified, through our work with rural people in low and middle-income countries, to support sustainable nutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Diversify our food baskets\n\n\n\n\nThere are about 5,000 food crops, yet more than half of our calories come from rice, wheat or maize. By cultivating neglected and under-utilized species like millet, fonio or teff, small-scale farmers can supply diverse and nutritious foods. These are sometimes called forgotten foods – or, as we prefer to call them, foods of the future. \nIn Malawi, farmers are growing millet, cowpeas and sorghum using local seeds. These nutritious staples mature early and provide food during the lean season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In Malawi, a woman prepares khobwe balls made from purple cowpeas. © IFAD/Kondwani Jere \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Explore agroecology\n\n\n\n\nSmall-scale farms are hotbeds of biodiversity. Using agroecology, smaller farms conserve natural resources while maintaining more biodiversity than larger ones, with richer soil and water leading to more nutritious crops. They often integrate animals, from livestock to fish, so that nutrients are not wasted.\nSixty per cent of IFAD projects completed between 2018 and 2023 implemented agroecological practices, strengthening food systems while adapting to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Invest in nutrition-sensitive value chains\n\n\n\n\nBy accessing value chains and connecting to markets, farmers earn better incomes to feed their own families. As part of nutrition-sensitive value chains, small enterprises provide inputs and technology, enhance the availability, affordability, diversity, safety and acceptability of nutritious foods, and reduce food losses. When small and medium-size rural enterprises (SMEs) flourish, so do rural producers and consumers.\nOver a quarter of IFAD project finance is invested in value chains, strengthening and integrating nutrition at every step, from production, processing and packaging to transportation, markets and consumers. In Nigeria, IFAD support enabled women like Cynthia to produce vitamin-A-fortified cassava seed and set up plants to process the cassava into garri for the local market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cynthia, a cassava seed entrepreneur, looks on as employees process garri from cassava root in the facility she recently established. © IFAD/Andrew Esiebo \n\n\n\n\n\n4. Nourish kids at school\n\n\n\n\nSchool meal programmes can be designed to prepare locally grown nutritious food for children. From Tajikistan to Guatemala, IFAD supports schools in sourcing nutritious foods from local farmers and cultivating school gardens, coupled with nutrition education, to give children the best possible start to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Teach family nutrition\n\n\n\n\nObesity and overweight are growing faster in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Amid the ever-increasing availability of cheap but unhealthy foods that are highly processed and high in fat, sugar and salt, nutrition education helps people make the right food choices. In Laos, IFAD-supported Farmer Nutrition Schools are teaching parents to prepare healthier and tastier food for their children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's stopping us from nourishing the world?\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in small-scale agriculture in low and middle-income countries is an investment in nourishing, sustainable food systems for generations to come. Yet nutrition accounts for under 1 per cent of overseas development assistance, and agriculture for 5–6 per cent. There is a food systems funding gap of US$300–400 billion a year.\nIt's high time that low and middle-income countries receive the support they need to boost nutrition and agricultural production alike – and one of the best ways to achieve this is through concessional financing, coupled with technical assistance, from international financial institutions like IFAD.\nInnovative financial instruments can help minimize risks while pooling public, private and philanthropic funds. In Uganda, private investors in the IFAD-supported Yield Fund supported SMEs like Pristine Foods Ltd., the first producer of high-protein egg powder in East Africa, which sources eggs from small-scale chicken farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition bonds can also channel private sector investment. In 2024, IFAD issued its first nutrition bond, raising US$50 million.\n\nAs the extent of the global nutrition crisis becomes clear, governments, private actors, rural communities and development agencies are coming to realize that the solution is in our hands.

So why is it that a third of the world’s population can’t afford a healthy diet?\nThe straightforward answer is that global food systems are not working. What we grow, and how we grow and consume it, isn’t working – both for the 148 million children under 5 who are stunted due to chronic undernutrition, and for the 390 million aged 5–19 who are overweight or obese. More than half the global population doesn’t get enough micronutrients for a healthy life. \nWhat can be done? Let’s explore the answers.\nWhy invest in nourishing the world?\nThe answer may seem obvious, as the right to food is a universal human right. We owe it to each other to make sure everyone in the world has enough nutritious food, not only to survive, but to thrive. \nBetter nutrition also leads to better health, educational achievement and earnings for individuals and communities. Every US$1 invested in nutrition generates US$23 in returns.\nGetting these returns isn’t just a matter of cultivating more – we need diverse, high-quality and nutritious food.\nThis means producing food now in a way that doesn’t harm the planet in the future. It means rethinking our food systems to respect and conserve water and soil, the building blocks of nutritious food. And it means building sustainable, productive and equitable food chains, in which producers are fairly recompensed and food travels safely from farm to plate.\nHow can we nourish the world – now and in the future?\nThe solution is local. Investing in small-scale agriculture and local food systems in low and middle-income countries is the best way to create nutritional security for all. That is why nutrition is at the heart of IFAD’s rural investments, and that is why 60 per cent of our projects for 2025–2027 are nutrition-sensitive.\nHere are five crucial investments we have identified, through our work with rural people in low and middle-income countries, to support sustainable nutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Diversify our food baskets\n\n\n\n\nThere are about 5,000 food crops, yet more than half of our calories come from rice, wheat or maize. By cultivating neglected and under-utilized species like millet, fonio or teff, small-scale farmers can supply diverse and nutritious foods. These are sometimes called forgotten foods – or, as we prefer to call them, foods of the future. \nIn Malawi, farmers are growing millet, cowpeas and sorghum using local seeds. These nutritious staples mature early and provide food during the lean season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In Malawi, a woman prepares khobwe balls made from purple cowpeas. © IFAD/Kondwani Jere \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Explore agroecology\n\n\n\n\nSmall-scale farms are hotbeds of biodiversity. Using agroecology, smaller farms conserve natural resources while maintaining more biodiversity than larger ones, with richer soil and water leading to more nutritious crops. They often integrate animals, from livestock to fish, so that nutrients are not wasted.\nSixty per cent of IFAD projects completed between 2018 and 2023 implemented agroecological practices, strengthening food systems while adapting to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Invest in nutrition-sensitive value chains\n\n\n\n\nBy accessing value chains and connecting to markets, farmers earn better incomes to feed their own families. As part of nutrition-sensitive value chains, small enterprises provide inputs and technology, enhance the availability, affordability, diversity, safety and acceptability of nutritious foods, and reduce food losses. When small and medium-size rural enterprises (SMEs) flourish, so do rural producers and consumers.\nOver a quarter of IFAD project finance is invested in value chains, strengthening and integrating nutrition at every step, from production, processing and packaging to transportation, markets and consumers. In Nigeria, IFAD support enabled women like Cynthia to produce vitamin-A-fortified cassava seed and set up plants to process the cassava into garri for the local market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cynthia, a cassava seed entrepreneur, looks on as employees process garri from cassava root in the facility she recently established. © IFAD/Andrew Esiebo \n\n\n\n\n\n4.

Teach family nutrition\n\n\n\n\nObesity and overweight are growing faster in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Amid the ever-increasing availability of cheap but unhealthy foods that are highly processed and high in fat, sugar and salt, nutrition education helps people make the right food choices.

Yet nutrition accounts for under 1 per cent of overseas development assistance, and agriculture for 5–6 per cent. There is a food systems funding gap of US$300–400 billion a year.\nIt's high time that low and middle-income countries receive the support they need to boost nutrition and agricultural production alike – and one of the best ways to achieve this is through concessional financing, coupled with technical assistance, from international financial institutions like IFAD.\nInnovative financial instruments can help minimize risks while pooling public, private and philanthropic funds.

In Uganda, private investors in the IFAD-supported Yield Fund supported SMEs like Pristine Foods Ltd., the first producer of high-protein egg powder in East Africa, which sources eggs from small-scale chicken farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition bonds can also channel private sector investment. In 2024, IFAD issued its first nutrition bond, raising US$50 million.\n\nAs the extent of the global nutrition crisis becomes clear, governments, private actors, rural communities and development agencies are coming to realize that the solution is in our hands. To nourish the world, we need to invest funds, knowledge and empowerment in rural people and small-scale producers, who are the key to the sustainable food systems of the future.\n\nIn a world of 8.2 billion people, we grow enough food to feed 10 billion. So why is it that a third of the world’s population can’t afford a healthy diet?\nThe straightforward answer is that global food systems are not working. What we grow, and how we grow and consume it, isn’t working – both for the 148 million children under 5 who are stunted due to chronic undernutrition, and for the 390 million aged 5–19 who are overweight or obese. More than half the global population doesn’t get enough micronutrients for a healthy life. \nWhat can be done? Let’s explore the answers.\nWhy invest in nourishing the world?\nThe answer may seem obvious, as the right to food is a universal human right. We owe it to each other to make sure everyone in the world has enough nutritious food, not only to survive, but to thrive. \nBetter nutrition also leads to better health, educational achievement and earnings for individuals and communities. Every US$1 invested in nutrition generates US$23 in returns.\nGetting these returns isn’t just a matter of cultivating more – we need diverse, high-quality and nutritious food.\nThis means producing food now in a way that doesn’t harm the planet in the future. It means rethinking our food systems to respect and conserve water and soil, the building blocks of nutritious food. And it means building sustainable, productive and equitable food chains, in which producers are fairly recompensed and food travels safely from farm to plate.\nHow can we nourish the world – now and in the future?\nThe solution is local. Investing in small-scale agriculture and local food systems in low and middle-income countries is the best way to create nutritional security for all. That is why nutrition is at the heart of IFAD’s rural investments, and that is why 60 per cent of our projects for 2025–2027 are nutrition-sensitive.\nHere are five crucial investments we have identified, through our work with rural people in low and middle-income countries, to support sustainable nutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Diversify our food baskets\n\n\n\n\nThere are about 5,000 food crops, yet more than half of our calories come from rice, wheat or maize. By cultivating neglected and under-utilized species like millet, fonio or teff, small-scale farmers can supply diverse and nutritious foods. These are sometimes called forgotten foods – or, as we prefer to call them, foods of the future. \nIn Malawi, farmers are growing millet, cowpeas and sorghum using local seeds. These nutritious staples mature early and provide food during the lean season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In Malawi, a woman prepares khobwe balls made from purple cowpeas. © IFAD/Kondwani Jere \n\n\n\n\n\n2. Explore agroecology\n\n\n\n\nSmall-scale farms are hotbeds of biodiversity. Using agroecology, smaller farms conserve natural resources while maintaining more biodiversity than larger ones, with richer soil and water leading to more nutritious crops. They often integrate animals, from livestock to fish, so that nutrients are not wasted.\nSixty per cent of IFAD projects completed between 2018 and 2023 implemented agroecological practices, strengthening food systems while adapting to climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Invest in nutrition-sensitive value chains\n\n\n\n\nBy accessing value chains and connecting to markets, farmers earn better incomes to feed their own families. As part of nutrition-sensitive value chains, small enterprises provide inputs and technology, enhance the availability, affordability, diversity, safety and acceptability of nutritious foods, and reduce food losses. When small and medium-size rural enterprises (SMEs) flourish, so do rural producers and consumers.\nOver a quarter of IFAD project finance is invested in value chains, strengthening and integrating nutrition at every step, from production, processing and packaging to transportation, markets and consumers. In Nigeria, IFAD support enabled women like Cynthia to produce vitamin-A-fortified cassava seed and set up plants to process the cassava into garri for the local market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cynthia, a cassava seed entrepreneur, looks on as employees process garri from cassava root in the facility she recently established. © IFAD/Andrew Esiebo \n\n\n\n\n\n4.

From Tajikistan to Guatemala, IFAD supports schools in sourcing nutritious foods from local farmers and cultivating school gardens, coupled with nutrition education, to give children the best possible start to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Teach family nutrition\n\n\n\n\nObesity and overweight are growing faster in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Amid the ever-increasing availability of cheap but unhealthy foods that are highly processed and high in fat, sugar and salt, nutrition education helps people make the right food choices.

In Uganda, private investors in the IFAD-supported Yield Fund supported SMEs like Pristine Foods Ltd., the first producer of high-protein egg powder in East Africa, which sources eggs from small-scale chicken farmers.\n\nInvesting in small-scale agriculture in low and middle-income countries is an investment in nourishing, sustainable food systems for generations to come.

It means rethinking our food systems to respect and conserve water and soil, the building blocks of nutritious food. And it means building sustainable, productive and equitable food chains, in which producers are fairly recompensed and food travels safely from farm to plate. Here are five crucial investments we have identified, through our work with rural people in low and middle-income countries, to support sustainable nutrition. Sixty per cent of IFAD projects completed between 2018 and 2023 implemented agroecological practices, strengthening food systems while adapting to climate change. As part of nutrition-sensitive value chains, small enterprises provide inputs and technology, enhance the availability, affordability, diversity, safety and acceptability of nutritious foods, and reduce food losses. From Tajikistan to Guatemala, IFAD supports schools in sourcing nutritious foods from local farmers and cultivating school gardens, coupled with nutrition education, to give children the best possible start to life. Amid the ever-increasing availability of cheap but unhealthy foods that are highly processed and high in fat, sugar and salt, nutrition education helps people make the right food choices. It's high time that low and middle-income countries receive the support they need to boost nutrition and agricultural production alike – and one of the best ways to achieve this is through concessional financing, coupled with technical assistance, from international financial institutions like IFAD. To nourish the world, we need to invest funds, knowledge and empowerment in rural people and small-scale producers, who are the key to the sustainable food systems of the future.

It means rethinking our food systems to respect and conserve water and soil, the building blocks of nutritious food. And it means building sustainable, productive and equitable food chains, in which producers are fairly recompensed and food travels safely from farm to plate. Here are five crucial investments we have identified, through our work with rural people in low and middle-income countries, to support sustainable nutrition. Sixty per cent of IFAD projects completed between 2018 and 2023 implemented agroecological practices, strengthening food systems while adapting to climate change. As part of nutrition-sensitive value chains, small enterprises provide inputs and technology, enhance the availability, affordability, diversity, safety and acceptability of nutritious foods, and reduce food losses. From Tajikistan to Guatemala, IFAD supports schools in sourcing nutritious foods from local farmers and cultivating school gardens, coupled with nutrition education, to give children the best possible start to life. Amid the ever-increasing availability of cheap but unhealthy foods that are highly processed and high in fat, sugar and salt, nutrition education helps people make the right food choices. It's high time that low and middle-income countries receive the support they need to boost nutrition and agricultural production alike – and one of the best ways to achieve this is through concessional financing, coupled with technical assistance, from international financial institutions like IFAD. To nourish the world, we need to invest funds, knowledge and empowerment in rural people and small-scale producers, who are the key to the sustainable food systems of the future.

As part of nutrition-sensitive value chains, small enterprises provide inputs and technology, enhance the availability, affordability, diversity, safety and acceptability of nutritious foods, and reduce food losses. From Tajikistan to Guatemala, IFAD supports schools in sourcing nutritious foods from local farmers and cultivating school gardens, coupled with nutrition education, to give children the best possible start to life. Amid the ever-increasing availability of cheap but unhealthy foods that are highly processed and high in fat, sugar and salt, nutrition education helps people make the right food choices. It's high time that low and middle-income countries receive the support they need to boost nutrition and agricultural production alike – and one of the best ways to achieve this is through concessional financing, coupled with technical assistance, from international financial institutions like IFAD. To nourish the world, we need to invest funds, knowledge and empowerment in rural people and small-scale producers, who are the key to the sustainable food systems of the future. It means rethinking our food systems to respect and conserve water and soil, the building blocks of nutritious food. And it means building sustainable, productive and equitable food chains, in which producers are fairly recompensed and food travels safely from farm to plate.
