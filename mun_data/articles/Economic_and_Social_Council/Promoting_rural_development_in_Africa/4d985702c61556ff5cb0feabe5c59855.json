The bees are thriving on the nectar from baobab, acacia and other native trees, producing 5–10 litres of honey per hive. And when Ngotina and Shakwa monitor their hives, they also keep an eye on the forest’s wellbeing.\n\n“My life is spent in the wild, we are surrounded by the wild. I love living in this environment,” says Shakwa.\n\nShakwa, a member of the Hadzabe community in Tanzania, says that beekeeping aligns with his deep respect for nature. © IFAD/Imani Nsamila\n\nShakwa, a member of the Hadzabe community in Tanzania, says that beekeeping aligns with his deep respect for nature. © IFAD/Imani Nsamila\n\nNurturing woodlands in Brazil\n\n\n\n\nIn the semi-arid Caatinga region of Brazil, young people like 18-year-old Iris are eagerly learning how to tend home gardens with a variety of trees, vegetables and medicinal plants. These home gardens, which were tailored to their local environment by the IFAD-supported PSA project, contributed to a 10 per cent decline in the number of families who faced difficulty obtaining enough food.\nA student at an Escola Família Agrícola (Family Agricultural School), Iris has learned how to use Agrocaatinga, a technique designed to conserve native Caatinga and food plants. Like the other students, she applies this practice at home, passing on her studies about sustainability and agroforestry to her parents.\nIris is just one of many guardians of the Caatinga woodlands who have partnered with PSA. Rural women like Adeline and her granddaughter Jucimara collect seeds and propagate creole varieties and native plants, which are adapted to local conditions. In doing so, they preserve the lush diversity of the Caatinga for future generations.\n\nNurturing woodlands in Brazil\n\nNurturing woodlands in Brazil\n\nIn the semi-arid Caatinga region of Brazil, young people like 18-year-old Iris are eagerly learning how to tend home gardens with a variety of trees, vegetables and medicinal plants.
