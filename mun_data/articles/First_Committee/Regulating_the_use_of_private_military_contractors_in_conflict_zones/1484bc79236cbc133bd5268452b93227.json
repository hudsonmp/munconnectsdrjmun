But our Washington team is also covering Trump and Netanyahu's meeting liveShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersWhen did this start? After Trump announced a large increase in US tariffs last Wednesday.And a tariff is... A tax paid to the government to bring goods into the country. Most countries have some tariffs. The US's were relatively low, but Trump has increased them significantly.Why did he do this? Trump's been saying he wants to do this for decades. The US buys more physical goods than it sells, and he claims this is unfair and threatens security. Tariffs, he says, will bring more jobs to the US. But most experts disagree... Most economists argue trade barriers such as tariffs reduce growth, and that such a quick and dramatic shift in tariff policy will make trade and investment harder. And how do other countries feel? Not great. Many have threatened to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US goods entering their countries.This affects stock markets because... Companies are facing higher costs to move their products across the world. There's also great uncertainty - it's not clear what Trump, or the countries he's putting tariffs on, will do next, making investment decisions more challenging. And stocks are what exactly? To own a stock is to own a share of a company - the more you have, the more of the company you own. A stock market is where people buy and sell these shares. So when a stock market index falls, it means the value of those companies have dropped.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterThe FTSE 100 has just had three pretty awful days of trading.On Thursday, investors in the UKâs biggest listed firms began to react to what Trumpâs tariffs will mean for them. Shares continued to slip on Friday and today.All told, the index has recorded a 10.5% slump since 'Liberation Day' - wiping out just shy of Â£250bn in value.That may sound mind-boggling, but for context it means the FTSE 100 is now back where it was around this time last year. So the loss is significant, but pension funds invested in the FTSE 100 over the long term shouldnât be too hurt.And investors are always keen to pour back in if they sense good news. The index saw a spike this afternoon after reports that Trump was considering a 90-day pause to the tariffs, but that turned out to be false.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, EPAMexico wants to avoid imposing reciprocal tariffs on US goods but it does not rule it out, President Claudia Sheinbaum says.Sheinbaum says that her country wants to continue talks with Washington before taking on any other measures, whilst protecting Mexican industries and companies.Mexico and Canada were spared the further tariffs announced for most other economies on 2 April. Both countries had already seen tariffs imposed in February - though these have since been partially rolled back.In March, US President Donald Trump announced he would temporarily suspend tariffs on Mexico \"as accommodation, and out of respect for\" the country's president.The US is one of Mexico's largest export markets.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMarkets worldwide have tumbled since US President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on imports from from nearly all economies.Asia-Pacific stocks from Shanghai to Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong plunged on Monday by levels not seen in decades. In Europe, the biggest stocks continued to slide - as is the case in the US, where trading is still open.The impact on the UK's FTSE 100, America's S&P 500, Germany's Dax and Japan's Nikkei has been wide-ranging.Here's an overview of each drop:Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy Gerry GeorgievaDuring the 15 minutes that President Donald Trump spoke to reporters last\nnight, he claimed that the United States was running a $1tn trade deficit with\nChina.He's just announced that he plans to hit Beijing with an extra 50% tariff unless it drops retaliatory levy We canât find any evidence for his claim, which he made\nseveral timesThe US does run a trade deficit with China, meaning that it\nimports more in goods from that country than it exports to it, but the figure\nwas just over $295bn for 2024, external. Globally, in\n2024, China exported nearly $1tn more goods, external than it imported so itâs possible\nthat Trump may have been mistakenly referring to this figure.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterEuropeâs biggest stock markets have all closed over 4% down after another hectic day following Trumpâs tariff announcements.The FTSE 100 index - made up of the largest firms listed in the UK - sunk 4.4% after the dayâs trading while the German Dax dropped 4.1% and the French Cac 40 fell 4.8%.To give you a sense of just how grim today was for the FTSE 100, only five stocks ended the day in the green - and by some pretty thin margins. Mexican mining firm Fresnillo was the biggest winner on a bad day, rising 1.3%.All of this underscores just how damaging these tariffs could be for the wider economy, with investors selling shares as they predict the profits of firms from all kinds of industries will be hit. That could mean companies cutting back and raising prices - hitting workers and consumers.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNatalie ShermanNew York business reporterTrump has just threated to hit imports from China with\nan additional 50% tax, unless Beijing withdraws the retaliatory measures it\nannounced last week.That would come on top of the 34% tariff he announced on goods\nfrom China last week, which themselves added to the tariff of at least 20% the White House has imposed since January. If enacted, many US companies bringing in goods from China facing a tax of at least 104% - roughly doubling their cost in a matter of months.Trump has responded to retaliation with similar enormous escalatory threats before.Recall his threat to hit alcohol from Europe with a 200%\ntax; or place a 50% tariff on Canadaâs steel and aluminium.In both those cases, the two sides reached a kind of dÃ©tente\nand the hikes never materialised.But those clashes involved longstanding allies. China has been a target of Washington before Trump.And\ndespite clear signals from the White House that it is interested in cutting a\ndeal around tariffs and TikTok, Beijing has yet to show much interest in negotiating. Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNatalie ShermanNew York business reporterMarkets are panicked by Trumpâs tariffs â and thereâs no\nquestion why. The plans have introduced a huge new cost for many companies,\none that is sure to shrink their profits, if not wipe them out entirely. Thatâs bad news for everyone invested in the stock market,\nwhich polls suggest amounts to about 60% of Americans, thanks to exposure in\nretirement accounts. That does not, however, mean that 60% of Americans are poised for huge\nlosses. The wealthiest Americans own the most stock â in fact, the\nFederal Reserve estimates that about 90% of the markets' trillions are owned by the\ntop 10% wealthiest Americans, who as of 2022 had typical holdings worth more\nthan $600,000 (Â£471,230).By comparison, those in the bottom half of the wealth\ndistribution typically had only about $12,600 tied up in the markets. That can explain why it is not difficult to find some voices\nwho are feeling relatively sanguine about the market turmoil, as my colleague Mike Wendling uncovered.On the other hand, if the market falls prompt the wealthy to\nhunker down and save, it could have big effects on the wider economy, much of\nwhich relies on their spending.

After Trump announced a large increase in US tariffs last Wednesday.And a tariff is... A tax paid to the government to bring goods into the country. Most countries have some tariffs. The US's were relatively low, but Trump has increased them significantly.Why did he do this? Trump's been saying he wants to do this for decades. The US buys more physical goods than it sells, and he claims this is unfair and threatens security. Tariffs, he says, will bring more jobs to the US. But most experts disagree... Most economists argue trade barriers such as tariffs reduce growth, and that such a quick and dramatic shift in tariff policy will make trade and investment harder. And how do other countries feel? Not great. Many have threatened to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US goods entering their countries.This affects stock markets because... Companies are facing higher costs to move their products across the world. There's also great uncertainty - it's not clear what Trump, or the countries he's putting tariffs on, will do next, making investment decisions more challenging. And stocks are what exactly? To own a stock is to own a share of a company - the more you have, the more of the company you own. A stock market is where people buy and sell these shares. So when a stock market index falls, it means the value of those companies have dropped.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterThe FTSE 100 has just had three pretty awful days of trading.On Thursday, investors in the UKâs biggest listed firms began to react to what Trumpâs tariffs will mean for them.

But our Washington team is also covering Trump and Netanyahu's meeting liveShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersWhen did this start? After Trump announced a large increase in US tariffs last Wednesday.And a tariff is... A tax paid to the government to bring goods into the country. Most countries have some tariffs. The US's were relatively low, but Trump has increased them significantly.Why did he do this? Trump's been saying he wants to do this for decades. The US buys more physical goods than it sells, and he claims this is unfair and threatens security. Tariffs, he says, will bring more jobs to the US. But most experts disagree... Most economists argue trade barriers such as tariffs reduce growth, and that such a quick and dramatic shift in tariff policy will make trade and investment harder. And how do other countries feel? Not great. Many have threatened to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US goods entering their countries.This affects stock markets because... Companies are facing higher costs to move their products across the world. There's also great uncertainty - it's not clear what Trump, or the countries he's putting tariffs on, will do next, making investment decisions more challenging. And stocks are what exactly? To own a stock is to own a share of a company - the more you have, the more of the company you own. A stock market is where people buy and sell these shares. So when a stock market index falls, it means the value of those companies have dropped.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterThe FTSE 100 has just had three pretty awful days of trading.On Thursday, investors in the UKâs biggest listed firms began to react to what Trumpâs tariffs will mean for them.

After Trump announced a large increase in US tariffs last Wednesday.And a tariff is... A tax paid to the government to bring goods into the country. Most countries have some tariffs. The US's were relatively low, but Trump has increased them significantly.Why did he do this? Trump's been saying he wants to do this for decades. The US buys more physical goods than it sells, and he claims this is unfair and threatens security. Tariffs, he says, will bring more jobs to the US. But most experts disagree... Most economists argue trade barriers such as tariffs reduce growth, and that such a quick and dramatic shift in tariff policy will make trade and investment harder. And how do other countries feel? Not great. Many have threatened to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US goods entering their countries.This affects stock markets because... Companies are facing higher costs to move their products across the world. There's also great uncertainty - it's not clear what Trump, or the countries he's putting tariffs on, will do next, making investment decisions more challenging. And stocks are what exactly? To own a stock is to own a share of a company - the more you have, the more of the company you own. A stock market is where people buy and sell these shares.

After Trump announced a large increase in US tariffs last Wednesday.And a tariff is... A tax paid to the government to bring goods into the country. Most countries have some tariffs. The US's were relatively low, but Trump has increased them significantly.Why did he do this? Trump's been saying he wants to do this for decades. The US buys more physical goods than it sells, and he claims this is unfair and threatens security. Tariffs, he says, will bring more jobs to the US. But most experts disagree... Most economists argue trade barriers such as tariffs reduce growth, and that such a quick and dramatic shift in tariff policy will make trade and investment harder. And how do other countries feel? Not great. Many have threatened to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US goods entering their countries.This affects stock markets because... Companies are facing higher costs to move their products across the world. There's also great uncertainty - it's not clear what Trump, or the countries he's putting tariffs on, will do next, making investment decisions more challenging. And stocks are what exactly? To own a stock is to own a share of a company - the more you have, the more of the company you own. A stock market is where people buy and sell these shares. So when a stock market index falls, it means the value of those companies have dropped.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterThe FTSE 100 has just had three pretty awful days of trading.On Thursday, investors in the UKâs biggest listed firms began to react to what Trumpâs tariffs will mean for them.

But the announcement means the vast majority of imports from China - which accounted for more than $400bn in trade last year, making it America's top source of imports after the European Union and Mexico - are facing a\ntariff rate of at least 54% - which Trump has now threatened to raise\nagain by another 50 percentage points.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersImage caption, A table showing all the new US tariffs on countries was unveiled by President Trump on WednesdayFurther countries have been reaching out to the US in order to reach a deal before higher custom tariffs on roughly 60 nations are due start on Wednesday 9 April.Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus has written a letter to US President Donald Trump to ask for a three-month pause to the tariffs he has imposed on them, a statement from their government said on Monday.Last week, the US announced 37% tariffs on the country, which is the world's second largest garment manufacturer.In the letter, Yunus also said his country \"will take all necessary actions to fully support [Trump's] trade agenda\".Meanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said he held a call with Trump in which \"both sides decided to designate cabinet members to take charge and continue discussions\". Currently, Japan faces 26% tariffs.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is due to tell the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday that nearly 50 countries have reached out to him to discuss the new tariffs, according to a written testimony seen by Reuters news agency.Greer says Argentina, Vietnam and Israel are among these nations.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he has been tasked with opening trade negotiations with Japan \"following a very constructive phone discussion\" between both governments. \"Japan remains among Americaâs closest allies, and I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies,\" he writes in a post on social media platform X.Bessent repeats his previous comments about over 50 countries reaching out to Trump in the past few days to engage in negotiations. \"We look forward to meaningful negotiations with them over the coming weeks,\" he adds.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy\nLucy GilderIn\nresponse to sharp falls on global markets following his tariff announcements,\nPresident Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, earlier to praise the state of the US\neconomy. âOil\nprices are down, interest rates are downâ¦ food prices are down, there is NO\nINFLATION,â he wrote.Itâs\ntrue that global oil prices, external have fallen steeply since the tariffs were\nannounced and interest rates on 30-year and 15-year fixed rate mortgages are\ndown too.Last month, food prices rose slightly â up by 0.2% â which\nwas a slower increase than the previous month.Overall inflation currently stands at 2.8%, external, down slightly from former President Bidenâs last month in office.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersImage caption, Maros SefcovicWhile we've been reporting on events in the US, EU trade ministers have been meeting in Luxembourg today to discuss how they will move forward.

If Trump is willing to listen â and cut a deal with Israel -\nit could provide an early example of how, through concessions and personal\nappeals, a country could extricate itself from the ongoing American trade\nwarfare.If thereâs some kind of big announcement,\nhowever, it wonât happen in a formal press conference. The one scheduled for\nthis afternoon was cancelled by the White House â without explanation â about\nan hour before its scheduled start time. Instead, the two men will answer\nquestions from the smaller press pool during their sit-down in the Oval Office.The White House has said more than 50 world leaders have reached\nout to Trump in the past few days to engage in negotiations. With just two days\nuntil those US tariffs go into effect, they are sure to be watching closely to\nsee if anything concrete comes from todayâs US-Israel talks â and what lessons\nthey can learn from them.If there any tariffs developments to report, we'll have that live here. But our Washington team is also covering Trump and Netanyahu's meeting liveShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersWhen did this start? After Trump announced a large increase in US tariffs last Wednesday.And a tariff is... A tax paid to the government to bring goods into the country. Most countries have some tariffs. The US's were relatively low, but Trump has increased them significantly.Why did he do this? Trump's been saying he wants to do this for decades. The US buys more physical goods than it sells, and he claims this is unfair and threatens security. Tariffs, he says, will bring more jobs to the US. But most experts disagree... Most economists argue trade barriers such as tariffs reduce growth, and that such a quick and dramatic shift in tariff policy will make trade and investment harder. And how do other countries feel? Not great. Many have threatened to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US goods entering their countries.This affects stock markets because... Companies are facing higher costs to move their products across the world. There's also great uncertainty - it's not clear what Trump, or the countries he's putting tariffs on, will do next, making investment decisions more challenging. And stocks are what exactly? To own a stock is to own a share of a company - the more you have, the more of the company you own. A stock market is where people buy and sell these shares. So when a stock market index falls, it means the value of those companies have dropped.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterThe FTSE 100 has just had three pretty awful days of trading.On Thursday, investors in the UKâs biggest listed firms began to react to what Trumpâs tariffs will mean for them. Shares continued to slip on Friday and today.All told, the index has recorded a 10.5% slump since 'Liberation Day' - wiping out just shy of Â£250bn in value.That may sound mind-boggling, but for context it means the FTSE 100 is now back where it was around this time last year. So the loss is significant, but pension funds invested in the FTSE 100 over the long term shouldnât be too hurt.And investors are always keen to pour back in if they sense good news. The index saw a spike this afternoon after reports that Trump was considering a 90-day pause to the tariffs, but that turned out to be false.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, EPAMexico wants to avoid imposing reciprocal tariffs on US goods but it does not rule it out, President Claudia Sheinbaum says.Sheinbaum says that her country wants to continue talks with Washington before taking on any other measures, whilst protecting Mexican industries and companies.Mexico and Canada were spared the further tariffs announced for most other economies on 2 April. Both countries had already seen tariffs imposed in February - though these have since been partially rolled back.In March, US President Donald Trump announced he would temporarily suspend tariffs on Mexico \"as accommodation, and out of respect for\" the country's president.The US is one of Mexico's largest export markets.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMarkets worldwide have tumbled since US President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on imports from from nearly all economies.Asia-Pacific stocks from Shanghai to Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong plunged on Monday by levels not seen in decades. In Europe, the biggest stocks continued to slide - as is the case in the US, where trading is still open.The impact on the UK's FTSE 100, America's S&P 500, Germany's Dax and Japan's Nikkei has been wide-ranging.Here's an overview of each drop:Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy Gerry GeorgievaDuring the 15 minutes that President Donald Trump spoke to reporters last\nnight, he claimed that the United States was running a $1tn trade deficit with\nChina.He's just announced that he plans to hit Beijing with an extra 50% tariff unless it drops retaliatory levy We canât find any evidence for his claim, which he made\nseveral timesThe US does run a trade deficit with China, meaning that it\nimports more in goods from that country than it exports to it, but the figure\nwas just over $295bn for 2024, external. Globally, in\n2024, China exported nearly $1tn more goods, external than it imported so itâs possible\nthat Trump may have been mistakenly referring to this figure.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterEuropeâs biggest stock markets have all closed over 4% down after another hectic day following Trumpâs tariff announcements.The FTSE 100 index - made up of the largest firms listed in the UK - sunk 4.4% after the dayâs trading while the German Dax dropped 4.1% and the French Cac 40 fell 4.8%.To give you a sense of just how grim today was for the FTSE 100, only five stocks ended the day in the green - and by some pretty thin margins. Mexican mining firm Fresnillo was the biggest winner on a bad day, rising 1.3%.All of this underscores just how damaging these tariffs could be for the wider economy, with investors selling shares as they predict the profits of firms from all kinds of industries will be hit. That could mean companies cutting back and raising prices - hitting workers and consumers.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNatalie ShermanNew York business reporterTrump has just threated to hit imports from China with\nan additional 50% tax, unless Beijing withdraws the retaliatory measures it\nannounced last week.That would come on top of the 34% tariff he announced on goods\nfrom China last week, which themselves added to the tariff of at least 20% the White House has imposed since January. If enacted, many US companies bringing in goods from China facing a tax of at least 104% - roughly doubling their cost in a matter of months.Trump has responded to retaliation with similar enormous escalatory threats before.Recall his threat to hit alcohol from Europe with a 200%\ntax; or place a 50% tariff on Canadaâs steel and aluminium.In both those cases, the two sides reached a kind of dÃ©tente\nand the hikes never materialised.But those clashes involved longstanding allies. China has been a target of Washington before Trump.And\ndespite clear signals from the White House that it is interested in cutting a\ndeal around tariffs and TikTok, Beijing has yet to show much interest in negotiating. Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNatalie ShermanNew York business reporterMarkets are panicked by Trumpâs tariffs â and thereâs no\nquestion why. The plans have introduced a huge new cost for many companies,\none that is sure to shrink their profits, if not wipe them out entirely. Thatâs bad news for everyone invested in the stock market,\nwhich polls suggest amounts to about 60% of Americans, thanks to exposure in\nretirement accounts. That does not, however, mean that 60% of Americans are poised for huge\nlosses. The wealthiest Americans own the most stock â in fact, the\nFederal Reserve estimates that about 90% of the markets' trillions are owned by the\ntop 10% wealthiest Americans, who as of 2022 had typical holdings worth more\nthan $600,000 (Â£471,230).By comparison, those in the bottom half of the wealth\ndistribution typically had only about $12,600 tied up in the markets. That can explain why it is not difficult to find some voices\nwho are feeling relatively sanguine about the market turmoil, as my colleague Mike Wendling uncovered.On the other hand, if the market falls prompt the wealthy to\nhunker down and save, it could have big effects on the wider economy, much of\nwhich relies on their spending.

So when a stock market index falls, it means the value of those companies have dropped.\n\nImage source, Reuters\n\nWhen did this start? After Trump announced a large increase in US tariffs last Wednesday.\n\nAnd a tariff is... A tax paid to the government to bring goods into the country. Most countries have some tariffs. The US's were relatively low, but Trump has increased them significantly.\n\nWhy did he do this? Trump's been saying he wants to do this for decades. The US buys more physical goods than it sells, and he claims this is unfair and threatens security. Tariffs, he says, will bring more jobs to the US.\n\nBut most experts disagree... Most economists argue trade barriers such as tariffs reduce growth, and that such a quick and dramatic shift in tariff policy will make trade and investment harder.\n\nAnd how do other countries feel? Not great. Many have threatened to retaliate by increasing tariffs on US goods entering their countries.\n\nThis affects stock markets because... Companies are facing higher costs to move their products across the world. There's also great uncertainty - it's not clear what Trump, or the countries he's putting tariffs on, will do next, making investment decisions more challenging.\n\nAnd stocks are what exactly? To own a stock is to own a share of a company - the more you have, the more of the company you own. A stock market is where people buy and sell these shares. So when a stock market index falls, it means the value of those companies have dropped.\n\nShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing\n\nShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing\n\nShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing\n\nclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing\n\nclose panel\n\nShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing\n\nShare page\n\nCopy link\n\nCopy link\n\nMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterThe FTSE 100 has just had three pretty awful days of trading.On Thursday, investors in the UKâs biggest listed firms began to react to what Trumpâs tariffs will mean for them.
