It was the biggest two-day loss of wealth ever recorded by Bloomberg’s billionaires index.Global stock markets tumble further as Trump insists on tariff ‘medicine’Read moreWithin that, a coterie of tycoons who have supported Trump or attended his inauguration in January have seen their wealth shrink. Here, we look at the four who have been worst hit by the market turmoil – and one billionaire still riding high this year.Elon MuskThe world’s richest man and the chief executive of Tesla – who has already seen his wealth drop precipitously after becoming a high-profile and controversial figure in Trump’s administration – has taken the biggest hit by some margin.Tesla was already facing a potential buyer backlash over its CEO’s controversial behaviour, and as its shares plunged, $31bn was wiped off Musk’s net worth between the opening bell on Thursday and the market closing on Friday. The recent fall in Tesla’s stock has meant his private rockets and satellites business, SpaceX, became his most valuable asset.So far this year, Musk’s estimated wealth has fallen by $130bn, although he still comfortably remains the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $302bn. Tesla’s shares fell nearly 5% on Wall Street on Monday afternoon, adding to these losses.Mark ZuckerbergView image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg.

Its stock dropped almost 14% over two days as the tariff war hit tech companies particularly hard. Its stock edged slightly higher on Monday, up almost 1%.Many of the world’s biggest companies rely on markets in Asia, which had the heaviest tariffs imposed on them by Trump, for manufacturing, computer chips and IT services.Zuckerberg, who performed a remarkable “Trump pivot” of Meta weeks before Trump took office, has seen more than $28bn wiped off his personal fortune so far this year.Jeff BezosView image in fullscreenJeff Bezos.

Amazon’s shares were marginally higher – up 0.4% - on Monday.In February, Bezos’s $10bn climate and biodiversity fund halted funding to one of the world’s most important climate-certification organisations, in a move viewed by some as a “bowing down” to Trump and his opposition to climate action.Bernard ArnaultView image in fullscreenBernard Arnault.
