He made this point at a press conference in Brussels with Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general. Later this evening he will become the first PM since Brexit to attend a European Council dinner with all leaders of the EU. (See 5.40pm.) Starmer adopted a diplomatic, even-handed tone after President Trump contrasted the ‚Äúnice‚Äù treatment he was getting from Starmer with the ‚Äúatrocity‚Äù EU, in comments that implied Trump wants to force the UK to side with the US as the price for avoiding tariffs. (See 9.34am.)\n\n\nBridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has urged parents to ensure their children attend school consistently, warning of ‚Äúa casual kind of attitude increasingly emerging‚Äù over attendance in England.\n\n\nKeir Starmer stopped using a personal email account when he was opposition leader after being warned about a suspected hack by a Russian group, it has been reported.\n\n\nThe EU will stand up for itself if its interests are targeted, Emmanuel Macron has said, as the bloc‚Äôs leaders urged talks but a firm response if needed to Donald Trump‚Äôs weekend threat to impose punishing tariffs.\nView image in fullscreenKeir Starmer speaking at his press conference in Brussels. Photograph: Omar Havana/APAngela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, has published details of the final local government settlement for 2025-26 for councils in England.She has also announced that six councils will be allowed to raise council tax by more than 5% ‚Äì the cap that applies unless councils can get voters to back a higher council tax increase in a referendums. Referendums have been held in the past, but they have never resulted in an increase of more above 5% being approved.In a written ministerial statement, Rayner said she had agreed ‚Äúsmall increases for six councils‚Äù.Councils are allowed to raise council tax by up to 5% if they have adult social care responsibilities. If they don‚Äôt, it is only 3%. But the six councils are all social care councils, and it means these upper limits will apply:Windsor and Maidenhead borough council ‚Äì 9%Birmingham city council ‚Äì 7.5%Bradford council ‚Äì 10%Newham council ‚Äì 9%Somerset council ‚Äì 7.5%Trafford council ‚Äì 7.5%The full details of the final local government settlement are here.The TaxPayers‚Äô Alliance, a rightwing campaign group that does not often praise Labour, has welcomed the news. It campaigned in particular against a proposal by Lib Dem-run Windsor and Maidenhead council to raise council tax by 25%. It posted this on social media.üö®BREAKING NEWS: 25% Council Tax Hike STOPPED in Windsor and Maidenhead üí™They will only be allowed to increase their council tax by 9%, meaning that the average household will be saving almost ¬£300 üò≤Well done @AngelaRayner for standing up to town hall bosses üëè pic.twitter.com/LedNdoKoEG‚Äî TaxPayers' Alliance (@the_tpa) February 3, 2025\nAs the press conference was winding up in Brussels, Keir Starmer was asked by a reporter from the Sun if he broke lockdown rules during Covid by designating his voice coach as a key worker. Starmer replied: ‚ÄúOf course not.‚ÄùThat is a reference to this allegation, which has been obsessively promoted on the CCHQ X feed all day.Here are the main lines from the Starmer/Rutte press conference. They covered defence policy, and tariffs.\n\nKeir Starmer repeatedly insisted that he did not think it would be necessary for the UK to choose between the US and the EU. Playing down the signficance of Trump‚Äôs threat to impose tariffs on the EU, he said that he did not accept the need to choose (see 4.18pm) and that it was not an either/or (see 4.35pm).\n\n\nMark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù to suggest that Trump‚Äôs threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. He said:\n\nAnd on Greenland, what I think is very useful is that President Trump alerted us to the fact that when it comes to the high north, there is a geopolitical and strategic issue at stake. I would say that it‚Äôs not only about Greenland. This has to do with Finland. It has to do with Sweden, Norway, Iceland. Yes, Greenland, and therefore Denmark. Also Canada and also the US. And clearly, collectively as an alliance, we will always look at the best way to make sure that we can tackle those challenges.\nIn response to a later question from ITV‚Äôs James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:\nYour question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US ‚Äì that is for so many reasons a silly thought ‚Ä¶.\nFor many reasons, that will not work.\nFirst of all, because we are not, as the prime minister was saying, when you look at Ukraine, it is not just Ukraine and Russia. It is a geopolitical thing which is going on. The US realises that, the European side of Nato realises that. It is China, North Korea, Iran, all getting connected to Russia ‚Ä¶\nSo for so many reasons, we have to stay connected. I am a staunch transatlanticist. I absolutely believe that the best thing the west can do is to stay united. And I know that the same thinking is still prevalent in the US, including in the White House.\n\n\nRutte insisted that the Greenland dispute would not undermine Nato. Asked if the alliance was unravelling, he replied:\n\nThere are always issues between allies. It is never always tranquil and happy going. There are always issues, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. But I‚Äôm absolutely convinced that will not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrence strong.\n\n\nStarmer played down the significance of Trump‚Äôs decision to threaten the EU with tariffs, saying it was ‚Äúearly days‚Äù and that further talks were planned. (See 4.50pm.)\n\n\nRutte claimed that the US had a trade surplus with Europe anyway. He said:\n\nAnd when you talk trade, it is interesting to see that the trade surplus of the US getting into Europe since 2022 ‚Äì they sell more to Europe than we sell to them. And the net surplus is $180bn since 2022.\n\n\nAnd Rutte said Europe was dramatically increasing its defence spending, implying US firms would benefit. He said:\n\nWhen you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it‚Äôs very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US].\nAnd by the way, collectively, we have to produce much more. There is so much money floating around, and much more will come in because we are spending more. Last year non-US allies spent 18% more on defence than the year before ‚Ä¶ That means more money available for the defence industrial base, and we have to buy it from everywhere.\nView image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte at their press conference. Photograph: Omar Havana/ReutersAnd this is what Keir Starmer told the BBC‚Äôs Chris Mason when Mason asked if he would water down his EU rest to avoid upsetting Trump. Starmer replied:\nLook in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I‚Äôve always been clear that both are important to us.\nNow that for me isn‚Äôt new. I think that‚Äôs always been the case and will be the case for many, many years to come.\nThat‚Äôs why, in my discussions with President Trump, we‚Äôve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we‚Äôve founded over many, many years ‚Ä¶\nBoth of these relations are very important to us. We are not choosing between them, but that‚Äôs historically been a position of the UK for many, many decades now.\nHere is the full reply from Keir Starmer to a question Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, who asked him if, in the light of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff threats, it was time to recognise that Trump was ‚Äúa bad thing for Europe‚Äôs economic prosperity and security‚Äù. (See 4.16pm.)Starmer replied:\nOn the question, firstly of tariffs, obviously, it‚Äôs early days, and I think what‚Äôs really important is open and strong trading relations, and that‚Äôs been the basis of my discussions with president Trump.\nAnd I know that intense US-EU discussions are planned.\nIn relation to ‚Ä¶ Ukraine, I do think it‚Äôs right for us to acknowledge the role that the US have played in relation to the joint efforts on Ukraine. And that‚Äôs pivotal, because it‚Äôs not just a question of a war or the sovereignty of Ukraine, it is not just a European issue, it‚Äôs a question of global security. And I think it‚Äôs very important that we see it in that context.\nStarmer also said that the Ukraine war had led to Nato becoming ‚Äústronger and bigger‚Äù.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte shaking hands at their press conference. Photograph: Simon Wohlfahrt/EPAQ: [To Starmer] What happens if you are forced to choose between the US and the UK?Starmer says it is vital for the UK that it works with both Europe and the US.\nIt‚Äôs really important that we work with both, and we don‚Äôt see it as an either/or.\nWe are working very closely with our European allies every day, particularly in Ukraine, but not only in Ukraine. But equally on defense and security with the US and the special relationship in relation to defense and security\nHe also says the UK has a huge amount of trade with both the US and the EU.\nIt‚Äôs important that I always act in the national interest, the best interests of the UK ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs important that we work with both sets of partners, particularly at this volatile time.\nAnd that‚Äôs the end of the press conference.Q: [To Rutte] Isn‚Äôt the threat to Greenland far more serious than any previous disgreement with the US. Doesn‚Äôt Europe have to start planning a way of defending itself in future without the US?Rutte says the idea of Nato without the US is a ‚Äúsilly thought‚Äù.He says he is a ‚Äústaunch Atlanticist‚Äù and thinks the west has to stay connected.And he says he knows that thinking is still prevalent in the White House.Q: Will you water down the EU reset to keep Trump onside?Starmer says the US and the EU are both important to the UK.That has always been the case, he says.He says, in talks with president Trump, he has spoken about defence and trade.\nBoth of these relations re very important between us. We are not choosing between them.\nUPDATE: See 5.05pm for a fuller version of the quote.Starmer and Rutte are now taking quesions.Q: [To Rutte] Do you fear the Atlantic alliance is unravelling?Rutte says there are always issues between allies.He says the US sells more to Europe than Europe does to them.And he claims this issue will ‚Äúnot have an impact on our collective deterrence‚Äù.Q: [To Starmer] Trump is threatening allies. Isn‚Äôt he a bad thing for security?Starmer says, on tariffs, it is ‚Äúearly days‚Äô.He says it is ‚Äúreally important‚Äù to have ‚Äúopen and strong trading relations‚Äù.And he plays tribute to the role the US has played in relation to Ukraine.Starmer goes on:\nThings that would have provoked utter outrage just a few years ago have now become almost commonplace. Russian spy ships loitering off the British coast, a campaign of sabotage across Europe, cyber attacks, election interference and attempted assassination.\nRussia is seeking to destabilise our continent and target our values. So we should still be outraged, and we must harden European defence ‚Ä¶\nOur defence spending is, of course, 2.3% of GDP now, and we‚Äôre working hard to set the path to 2.5%.\nKeir Starmer is speaking now.He recalls visiting Ukraine recently and stresses the need for Nato countries to keep up the pressure on Russia, using the quotes briefed overnight.

Referendums have been held in the past, but they have never resulted in an increase of more above 5% being approved.In a written ministerial statement, Rayner said she had agreed ‚Äúsmall increases for six councils‚Äù.Councils are allowed to raise council tax by up to 5% if they have adult social care responsibilities.

Starmer replied: ‚ÄúOf course not.‚ÄùThat is a reference to this allegation, which has been obsessively promoted on the CCHQ X feed all day.Here are the main lines from the Starmer/Rutte press conference. They covered defence policy, and tariffs.\n\nKeir Starmer repeatedly insisted that he did not think it would be necessary for the UK to choose between the US and the EU. Playing down the signficance of Trump‚Äôs threat to impose tariffs on the EU, he said that he did not accept the need to choose (see 4.18pm) and that it was not an either/or (see 4.35pm).\n\n\nMark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù to suggest that Trump‚Äôs threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. He said:\n\nAnd on Greenland, what I think is very useful is that President Trump alerted us to the fact that when it comes to the high north, there is a geopolitical and strategic issue at stake. I would say that it‚Äôs not only about Greenland. This has to do with Finland. It has to do with Sweden, Norway, Iceland. Yes, Greenland, and therefore Denmark. Also Canada and also the US. And clearly, collectively as an alliance, we will always look at the best way to make sure that we can tackle those challenges.\nIn response to a later question from ITV‚Äôs James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:\nYour question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US ‚Äì that is for so many reasons a silly thought ‚Ä¶.\nFor many reasons, that will not work.\nFirst of all, because we are not, as the prime minister was saying, when you look at Ukraine, it is not just Ukraine and Russia. It is a geopolitical thing which is going on. The US realises that, the European side of Nato realises that. It is China, North Korea, Iran, all getting connected to Russia ‚Ä¶\nSo for so many reasons, we have to stay connected. I am a staunch transatlanticist. I absolutely believe that the best thing the west can do is to stay united. And I know that the same thinking is still prevalent in the US, including in the White House.\n\n\nRutte insisted that the Greenland dispute would not undermine Nato. Asked if the alliance was unravelling, he replied:\n\nThere are always issues between allies. It is never always tranquil and happy going. There are always issues, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. But I‚Äôm absolutely convinced that will not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrence strong.\n\n\nStarmer played down the significance of Trump‚Äôs decision to threaten the EU with tariffs, saying it was ‚Äúearly days‚Äù and that further talks were planned. (See 4.50pm.)\n\n\nRutte claimed that the US had a trade surplus with Europe anyway. He said:\n\nAnd when you talk trade, it is interesting to see that the trade surplus of the US getting into Europe since 2022 ‚Äì they sell more to Europe than we sell to them. And the net surplus is $180bn since 2022.\n\n\nAnd Rutte said Europe was dramatically increasing its defence spending, implying US firms would benefit. He said:\n\nWhen you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it‚Äôs very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US].\nAnd by the way, collectively, we have to produce much more. There is so much money floating around, and much more will come in because we are spending more. Last year non-US allies spent 18% more on defence than the year before ‚Ä¶ That means more money available for the defence industrial base, and we have to buy it from everywhere.\nView image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte at their press conference. Photograph: Omar Havana/ReutersAnd this is what Keir Starmer told the BBC‚Äôs Chris Mason when Mason asked if he would water down his EU rest to avoid upsetting Trump. Starmer replied:\nLook in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I‚Äôve always been clear that both are important to us.\nNow that for me isn‚Äôt new. I think that‚Äôs always been the case and will be the case for many, many years to come.\nThat‚Äôs why, in my discussions with President Trump, we‚Äôve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we‚Äôve founded over many, many years ‚Ä¶\nBoth of these relations are very important to us. We are not choosing between them, but that‚Äôs historically been a position of the UK for many, many decades now.\nHere is the full reply from Keir Starmer to a question Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, who asked him if, in the light of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff threats, it was time to recognise that Trump was ‚Äúa bad thing for Europe‚Äôs economic prosperity and security‚Äù. (See 4.16pm.)Starmer replied:\nOn the question, firstly of tariffs, obviously, it‚Äôs early days, and I think what‚Äôs really important is open and strong trading relations, and that‚Äôs been the basis of my discussions with president Trump.\nAnd I know that intense US-EU discussions are planned.\nIn relation to ‚Ä¶ Ukraine, I do think it‚Äôs right for us to acknowledge the role that the US have played in relation to the joint efforts on Ukraine. And that‚Äôs pivotal, because it‚Äôs not just a question of a war or the sovereignty of Ukraine, it is not just a European issue, it‚Äôs a question of global security. And I think it‚Äôs very important that we see it in that context.\nStarmer also said that the Ukraine war had led to Nato becoming ‚Äústronger and bigger‚Äù.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte shaking hands at their press conference. Photograph: Simon Wohlfahrt/EPAQ: [To Starmer] What happens if you are forced to choose between the US and the UK?Starmer says it is vital for the UK that it works with both Europe and the US.\nIt‚Äôs really important that we work with both, and we don‚Äôt see it as an either/or.\nWe are working very closely with our European allies every day, particularly in Ukraine, but not only in Ukraine. But equally on defense and security with the US and the special relationship in relation to defense and security\nHe also says the UK has a huge amount of trade with both the US and the EU.\nIt‚Äôs important that I always act in the national interest, the best interests of the UK ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs important that we work with both sets of partners, particularly at this volatile time.\nAnd that‚Äôs the end of the press conference.Q: [To Rutte] Isn‚Äôt the threat to Greenland far more serious than any previous disgreement with the US. Doesn‚Äôt Europe have to start planning a way of defending itself in future without the US?Rutte says the idea of Nato without the US is a ‚Äúsilly thought‚Äù.He says he is a ‚Äústaunch Atlanticist‚Äù and thinks the west has to stay connected.And he says he knows that thinking is still prevalent in the White House.Q: Will you water down the EU reset to keep Trump onside?Starmer says the US and the EU are both important to the UK.That has always been the case, he says.He says, in talks with president Trump, he has spoken about defence and trade.\nBoth of these relations re very important between us.

Isn‚Äôt he a bad thing for security?Starmer says, on tariffs, it is ‚Äúearly days‚Äô.He says it is ‚Äúreally important‚Äù to have ‚Äúopen and strong trading relations‚Äù.And he plays tribute to the role the US has played in relation to Ukraine.Starmer goes on:\nThings that would have provoked utter outrage just a few years ago have now become almost commonplace. Russian spy ships loitering off the British coast, a campaign of sabotage across Europe, cyber attacks, election interference and attempted assassination.\nRussia is seeking to destabilise our continent and target our values. So we should still be outraged, and we must harden European defence ‚Ä¶\nOur defence spending is, of course, 2.3% of GDP now, and we‚Äôre working hard to set the path to 2.5%.\nKeir Starmer is speaking now.He recalls visiting Ukraine recently and stresses the need for Nato countries to keep up the pressure on Russia, using the quotes briefed overnight.

Starmer replied: ‚ÄúOf course not.‚ÄùThat is a reference to this allegation, which has been obsessively promoted on the CCHQ X feed all day.Here are the main lines from the Starmer/Rutte press conference. They covered defence policy, and tariffs.\n\nKeir Starmer repeatedly insisted that he did not think it would be necessary for the UK to choose between the US and the EU. Playing down the signficance of Trump‚Äôs threat to impose tariffs on the EU, he said that he did not accept the need to choose (see 4.18pm) and that it was not an either/or (see 4.35pm).\n\n\nMark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù to suggest that Trump‚Äôs threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. He said:\n\nAnd on Greenland, what I think is very useful is that President Trump alerted us to the fact that when it comes to the high north, there is a geopolitical and strategic issue at stake. I would say that it‚Äôs not only about Greenland. This has to do with Finland. It has to do with Sweden, Norway, Iceland. Yes, Greenland, and therefore Denmark. Also Canada and also the US. And clearly, collectively as an alliance, we will always look at the best way to make sure that we can tackle those challenges.\nIn response to a later question from ITV‚Äôs James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:\nYour question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US ‚Äì that is for so many reasons a silly thought ‚Ä¶.\nFor many reasons, that will not work.\nFirst of all, because we are not, as the prime minister was saying, when you look at Ukraine, it is not just Ukraine and Russia. It is a geopolitical thing which is going on. The US realises that, the European side of Nato realises that. It is China, North Korea, Iran, all getting connected to Russia ‚Ä¶\nSo for so many reasons, we have to stay connected. I am a staunch transatlanticist. I absolutely believe that the best thing the west can do is to stay united. And I know that the same thinking is still prevalent in the US, including in the White House.\n\n\nRutte insisted that the Greenland dispute would not undermine Nato. Asked if the alliance was unravelling, he replied:\n\nThere are always issues between allies. It is never always tranquil and happy going. There are always issues, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. But I‚Äôm absolutely convinced that will not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrence strong.\n\n\nStarmer played down the significance of Trump‚Äôs decision to threaten the EU with tariffs, saying it was ‚Äúearly days‚Äù and that further talks were planned. (See 4.50pm.)\n\n\nRutte claimed that the US had a trade surplus with Europe anyway. He said:\n\nAnd when you talk trade, it is interesting to see that the trade surplus of the US getting into Europe since 2022 ‚Äì they sell more to Europe than we sell to them. And the net surplus is $180bn since 2022.\n\n\nAnd Rutte said Europe was dramatically increasing its defence spending, implying US firms would benefit. He said:\n\nWhen you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it‚Äôs very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US].\nAnd by the way, collectively, we have to produce much more. There is so much money floating around, and much more will come in because we are spending more. Last year non-US allies spent 18% more on defence than the year before ‚Ä¶ That means more money available for the defence industrial base, and we have to buy it from everywhere.\nView image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte at their press conference.

Starmer replied: ‚ÄúOf course not.‚ÄùThat is a reference to this allegation, which has been obsessively promoted on the CCHQ X feed all day.Here are the main lines from the Starmer/Rutte press conference. They covered defence policy, and tariffs.\n\nKeir Starmer repeatedly insisted that he did not think it would be necessary for the UK to choose between the US and the EU. Playing down the signficance of Trump‚Äôs threat to impose tariffs on the EU, he said that he did not accept the need to choose (see 4.18pm) and that it was not an either/or (see 4.35pm).\n\n\nMark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù to suggest that Trump‚Äôs threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. He said:\n\nAnd on Greenland, what I think is very useful is that President Trump alerted us to the fact that when it comes to the high north, there is a geopolitical and strategic issue at stake. I would say that it‚Äôs not only about Greenland. This has to do with Finland. It has to do with Sweden, Norway, Iceland. Yes, Greenland, and therefore Denmark. Also Canada and also the US. And clearly, collectively as an alliance, we will always look at the best way to make sure that we can tackle those challenges.\nIn response to a later question from ITV‚Äôs James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:\nYour question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US ‚Äì that is for so many reasons a silly thought ‚Ä¶.\nFor many reasons, that will not work.\nFirst of all, because we are not, as the prime minister was saying, when you look at Ukraine, it is not just Ukraine and Russia. It is a geopolitical thing which is going on. The US realises that, the European side of Nato realises that. It is China, North Korea, Iran, all getting connected to Russia ‚Ä¶\nSo for so many reasons, we have to stay connected. I am a staunch transatlanticist. I absolutely believe that the best thing the west can do is to stay united. And I know that the same thinking is still prevalent in the US, including in the White House.\n\n\nRutte insisted that the Greenland dispute would not undermine Nato. Asked if the alliance was unravelling, he replied:\n\nThere are always issues between allies. It is never always tranquil and happy going. There are always issues, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. But I‚Äôm absolutely convinced that will not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrence strong.\n\n\nStarmer played down the significance of Trump‚Äôs decision to threaten the EU with tariffs, saying it was ‚Äúearly days‚Äù and that further talks were planned. (See 4.50pm.)\n\n\nRutte claimed that the US had a trade surplus with Europe anyway. He said:\n\nAnd when you talk trade, it is interesting to see that the trade surplus of the US getting into Europe since 2022 ‚Äì they sell more to Europe than we sell to them. And the net surplus is $180bn since 2022.\n\n\nAnd Rutte said Europe was dramatically increasing its defence spending, implying US firms would benefit. He said:\n\nWhen you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it‚Äôs very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US].\nAnd by the way, collectively, we have to produce much more. There is so much money floating around, and much more will come in because we are spending more. Last year non-US allies spent 18% more on defence than the year before ‚Ä¶ That means more money available for the defence industrial base, and we have to buy it from everywhere.\nView image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte at their press conference.

Starmer replied: ‚ÄúOf course not.‚ÄùThat is a reference to this allegation, which has been obsessively promoted on the CCHQ X feed all day.Here are the main lines from the Starmer/Rutte press conference. They covered defence policy, and tariffs.\n\nKeir Starmer repeatedly insisted that he did not think it would be necessary for the UK to choose between the US and the EU. Playing down the signficance of Trump‚Äôs threat to impose tariffs on the EU, he said that he did not accept the need to choose (see 4.18pm) and that it was not an either/or (see 4.35pm).\n\n\nMark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù to suggest that Trump‚Äôs threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. He said:\n\nAnd on Greenland, what I think is very useful is that President Trump alerted us to the fact that when it comes to the high north, there is a geopolitical and strategic issue at stake. I would say that it‚Äôs not only about Greenland. This has to do with Finland. It has to do with Sweden, Norway, Iceland. Yes, Greenland, and therefore Denmark. Also Canada and also the US. And clearly, collectively as an alliance, we will always look at the best way to make sure that we can tackle those challenges.\nIn response to a later question from ITV‚Äôs James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:\nYour question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US ‚Äì that is for so many reasons a silly thought ‚Ä¶.\nFor many reasons, that will not work.\nFirst of all, because we are not, as the prime minister was saying, when you look at Ukraine, it is not just Ukraine and Russia. It is a geopolitical thing which is going on. The US realises that, the European side of Nato realises that. It is China, North Korea, Iran, all getting connected to Russia ‚Ä¶\nSo for so many reasons, we have to stay connected. I am a staunch transatlanticist. I absolutely believe that the best thing the west can do is to stay united. And I know that the same thinking is still prevalent in the US, including in the White House.\n\n\nRutte insisted that the Greenland dispute would not undermine Nato. Asked if the alliance was unravelling, he replied:\n\nThere are always issues between allies. It is never always tranquil and happy going. There are always issues, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. But I‚Äôm absolutely convinced that will not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrence strong.\n\n\nStarmer played down the significance of Trump‚Äôs decision to threaten the EU with tariffs, saying it was ‚Äúearly days‚Äù and that further talks were planned. (See 4.50pm.)\n\n\nRutte claimed that the US had a trade surplus with Europe anyway. He said:\n\nAnd when you talk trade, it is interesting to see that the trade surplus of the US getting into Europe since 2022 ‚Äì they sell more to Europe than we sell to them. And the net surplus is $180bn since 2022.\n\n\nAnd Rutte said Europe was dramatically increasing its defence spending, implying US firms would benefit. He said:\n\nWhen you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it‚Äôs very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US].\nAnd by the way, collectively, we have to produce much more. There is so much money floating around, and much more will come in because we are spending more. Last year non-US allies spent 18% more on defence than the year before ‚Ä¶ That means more money available for the defence industrial base, and we have to buy it from everywhere.\nView image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte at their press conference.

Starmer replied: ‚ÄúOf course not.‚ÄùThat is a reference to this allegation, which has been obsessively promoted on the CCHQ X feed all day.Here are the main lines from the Starmer/Rutte press conference. They covered defence policy, and tariffs.\n\nKeir Starmer repeatedly insisted that he did not think it would be necessary for the UK to choose between the US and the EU. Playing down the signficance of Trump‚Äôs threat to impose tariffs on the EU, he said that he did not accept the need to choose (see 4.18pm) and that it was not an either/or (see 4.35pm).\n\n\nMark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù to suggest that Trump‚Äôs threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. He said:\n\nAnd on Greenland, what I think is very useful is that President Trump alerted us to the fact that when it comes to the high north, there is a geopolitical and strategic issue at stake. I would say that it‚Äôs not only about Greenland. This has to do with Finland. It has to do with Sweden, Norway, Iceland. Yes, Greenland, and therefore Denmark. Also Canada and also the US. And clearly, collectively as an alliance, we will always look at the best way to make sure that we can tackle those challenges.\nIn response to a later question from ITV‚Äôs James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:\nYour question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US ‚Äì that is for so many reasons a silly thought ‚Ä¶.\nFor many reasons, that will not work.\nFirst of all, because we are not, as the prime minister was saying, when you look at Ukraine, it is not just Ukraine and Russia. It is a geopolitical thing which is going on. The US realises that, the European side of Nato realises that. It is China, North Korea, Iran, all getting connected to Russia ‚Ä¶\nSo for so many reasons, we have to stay connected. I am a staunch transatlanticist. I absolutely believe that the best thing the west can do is to stay united. And I know that the same thinking is still prevalent in the US, including in the White House.\n\n\nRutte insisted that the Greenland dispute would not undermine Nato. Asked if the alliance was unravelling, he replied:\n\nThere are always issues between allies. It is never always tranquil and happy going. There are always issues, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. But I‚Äôm absolutely convinced that will not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrence strong.\n\n\nStarmer played down the significance of Trump‚Äôs decision to threaten the EU with tariffs, saying it was ‚Äúearly days‚Äù and that further talks were planned. (See 4.50pm.)\n\n\nRutte claimed that the US had a trade surplus with Europe anyway. He said:\n\nAnd when you talk trade, it is interesting to see that the trade surplus of the US getting into Europe since 2022 ‚Äì they sell more to Europe than we sell to them. And the net surplus is $180bn since 2022.\n\n\nAnd Rutte said Europe was dramatically increasing its defence spending, implying US firms would benefit. He said:\n\nWhen you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it‚Äôs very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US].\nAnd by the way, collectively, we have to produce much more. There is so much money floating around, and much more will come in because we are spending more. Last year non-US allies spent 18% more on defence than the year before ‚Ä¶ That means more money available for the defence industrial base, and we have to buy it from everywhere.\nView image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte at their press conference. Photograph: Omar Havana/ReutersAnd this is what Keir Starmer told the BBC‚Äôs Chris Mason when Mason asked if he would water down his EU rest to avoid upsetting Trump. Starmer replied:\nLook in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I‚Äôve always been clear that both are important to us.\nNow that for me isn‚Äôt new. I think that‚Äôs always been the case and will be the case for many, many years to come.\nThat‚Äôs why, in my discussions with President Trump, we‚Äôve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we‚Äôve founded over many, many years ‚Ä¶\nBoth of these relations are very important to us. We are not choosing between them, but that‚Äôs historically been a position of the UK for many, many decades now.\nHere is the full reply from Keir Starmer to a question Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, who asked him if, in the light of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff threats, it was time to recognise that Trump was ‚Äúa bad thing for Europe‚Äôs economic prosperity and security‚Äù. (See 4.16pm.)Starmer replied:\nOn the question, firstly of tariffs, obviously, it‚Äôs early days, and I think what‚Äôs really important is open and strong trading relations, and that‚Äôs been the basis of my discussions with president Trump.\nAnd I know that intense US-EU discussions are planned.\nIn relation to ‚Ä¶ Ukraine, I do think it‚Äôs right for us to acknowledge the role that the US have played in relation to the joint efforts on Ukraine. And that‚Äôs pivotal, because it‚Äôs not just a question of a war or the sovereignty of Ukraine, it is not just a European issue, it‚Äôs a question of global security. And I think it‚Äôs very important that we see it in that context.\nStarmer also said that the Ukraine war had led to Nato becoming ‚Äústronger and bigger‚Äù.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte shaking hands at their press conference.

He said:\n\nAnd on Greenland, what I think is very useful is that President Trump alerted us to the fact that when it comes to the high north, there is a geopolitical and strategic issue at stake.

Mark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù to suggest that Trump‚Äôs threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. In response to a later question from ITV‚Äôs James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:\nYour question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US ‚Äì that is for so many reasons a silly thought ‚Ä¶. He said:\n\nWhen you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it‚Äôs very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US]. Starmer replied:\nLook in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I‚Äôve always been clear that both are important to us. That‚Äôs why, in my discussions with President Trump, we‚Äôve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we‚Äôve founded over many, many years ‚Ä¶\nBoth of these relations are very important to us. Here is the full reply from Keir Starmer to a question Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, who asked him if, in the light of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff threats, it was time to recognise that Trump was ‚Äúa bad thing for Europe‚Äôs economic prosperity and security‚Äù. Starmer also said that the Ukraine war had led to Nato becoming ‚Äústronger and bigger‚Äù.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte shaking hands at their press conference.

UPDATE: See 5.05pm for a fuller version of the quote.Starmer and Rutte are now taking quesions.Q: [To Rutte] Do you fear the Atlantic alliance is unravelling?Rutte says there are always issues between allies.He says the US sells more to Europe than Europe does to them.And he claims this issue will ‚Äúnot have an impact on our collective deterrence‚Äù.Q: [To Starmer] Trump is threatening allies. Isn‚Äôt he a bad thing for security?Starmer says, on tariffs, it is ‚Äúearly days‚Äô.He says it is ‚Äúreally important‚Äù to have ‚Äúopen and strong trading relations‚Äù.And he plays tribute to the role the US has played in relation to Ukraine.Starmer goes on:\nThings that would have provoked utter outrage just a few years ago have now become almost commonplace.

Mark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was ‚Äúsilly‚Äù to suggest that Trump‚Äôs threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. In response to a later question from ITV‚Äôs James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:\nYour question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US ‚Äì that is for so many reasons a silly thought ‚Ä¶. He said:\n\nWhen you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it‚Äôs very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US].
