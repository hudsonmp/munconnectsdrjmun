In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nNiger Junta’s Release of Detainees Falls Short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         News Release \n\nSouth Korea Court Removes President Yoon from Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nGerman Proposal to Strip Citizenship Endangers Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         News Release \n\nIran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”\n\n\nIncreasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania\n\n\n                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.\n              \n\n        April 7, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”\n\n\nDisproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia\n\n\n                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.\n              \n\n        March 26, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It Tears You Apart”\n\n\nPoverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System\n\n\n                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people. In particular, the lack of adequate support affects single mothers raising young children and older women living alone on low incomes.\n              \n\n        March 24, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving in Fear and Humiliation\n\n\nRising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia\n\n\n                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. Migrants are also subject to new, often abusive administrative restrictions. Following the attack, Russian officials doubled down, fanning the fire of racist and anti-migrant public sentiments. Russian authorities should condemn any expression of xenophobia, including by their own officials, and work to ensure full compliance with the rights of migrants.\n              \n\n        March 17, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“There’s Just No More Land”\n\n\nCommunity-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands\n\n\n                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.\n              \n\n        March 17, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoisonous Profit\n\n\nLead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia\n\n\n                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.\n              \n\n        March 5, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Australia: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children\n      \n\n \n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Protecting Rights Even in the Darkest Times\n      \n\n \n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Iraq Torture Survivors Await US Justice\n      \n\n \n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Damascus Mass Grave Needs to be Preserved and Investigated\n      \n\n \n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Gaza: Israel’s Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\n      \n\n \nRead a text description of this video\n\n\nRead a text description of this video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. We’ve just been targeted. We’ve just been targeted by warplanes. We are now with the Red Crescent crews. Thank God for your safety, Firas. Thank you, Firas. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends. Because this tent you see in front of you won’t hold up in winter. The feeling of loss itself is beyond comparison to any other feeling. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens,

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nNiger Junta’s Release of Detainees Falls Short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         News Release \n\nSouth Korea Court Removes President Yoon from Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nGerman Proposal to Strip Citizenship Endangers Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         News Release \n\nIran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”\n\n\nIncreasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania\n\n\n                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.\n              \n\n        April 7, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”\n\n\nDisproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia\n\n\n                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.\n              \n\n        March 26, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It Tears You Apart”\n\n\nPoverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System\n\n\n                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Migrants are also subject to new, often abusive administrative restrictions. Following the attack, Russian officials doubled down, fanning the fire of racist and anti-migrant public sentiments. Russian authorities should condemn any expression of xenophobia, including by their own officials, and work to ensure full compliance with the rights of migrants.\n              \n\n        March 17, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“There’s Just No More Land”\n\n\nCommunity-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands\n\n\n                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened.

The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends. Because this tent you see in front of you won’t hold up in winter. The feeling of loss itself is beyond comparison to any other feeling. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens,

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nNiger Junta’s Release of Detainees Falls Short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         News Release \n\nSouth Korea Court Removes President Yoon from Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nGerman Proposal to Strip Citizenship Endangers Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         News Release \n\nIran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”\n\n\nIncreasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania\n\n\n                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.\n              \n\n        April 7, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”\n\n\nDisproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia\n\n\n                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.\n              \n\n        March 26, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It Tears You Apart”\n\n\nPoverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System\n\n\n                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Migrants are also subject to new, often abusive administrative restrictions. Following the attack, Russian officials doubled down, fanning the fire of racist and anti-migrant public sentiments.

We’ve just been targeted. We’ve just been targeted by warplanes. We are now with the Red Crescent crews. Thank God for your safety, Firas. Thank you, Firas. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends. Because this tent you see in front of you won’t hold up in winter. The feeling of loss itself is beyond comparison to any other feeling. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens,

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nNiger Junta’s Release of Detainees Falls Short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         News Release \n\nSouth Korea Court Removes President Yoon from Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nGerman Proposal to Strip Citizenship Endangers Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         News Release \n\nIran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”\n\n\nIncreasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania\n\n\n                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.\n              \n\n        April 7, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”\n\n\nDisproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia\n\n\n                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.\n              \n\n        March 26, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It Tears You Apart”\n\n\nPoverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System\n\n\n                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Migrants are also subject to new, often abusive administrative restrictions. Following the attack, Russian officials doubled down, fanning the fire of racist and anti-migrant public sentiments.

We’ve just been targeted. We’ve just been targeted by warplanes. We are now with the Red Crescent crews. Thank God for your safety, Firas. Thank you, Firas. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends. Because this tent you see in front of you won’t hold up in winter. The feeling of loss itself is beyond comparison to any other feeling. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens,

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nNiger Junta’s Release of Detainees Falls Short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         News Release \n\nSouth Korea Court Removes President Yoon from Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nGerman Proposal to Strip Citizenship Endangers Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         News Release \n\nIran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”\n\n\nIncreasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania\n\n\n                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.\n              \n\n        April 7, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”\n\n\nDisproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia\n\n\n                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.\n              \n\n        March 26, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It Tears You Apart”\n\n\nPoverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System\n\n\n                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Migrants are also subject to new, often abusive administrative restrictions. Following the attack, Russian officials doubled down, fanning the fire of racist and anti-migrant public sentiments.

We’ve just been targeted. We’ve just been targeted by warplanes. We are now with the Red Crescent crews. Thank God for your safety, Firas. Thank you, Firas. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends. Because this tent you see in front of you won’t hold up in winter. The feeling of loss itself is beyond comparison to any other feeling. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens,

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nNiger Junta’s Release of Detainees Falls Short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         News Release \n\nSouth Korea Court Removes President Yoon from Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nGerman Proposal to Strip Citizenship Endangers Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         News Release \n\nIran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”\n\n\nIncreasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania\n\n\n                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.\n              \n\n        April 7, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”\n\n\nDisproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia\n\n\n                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.\n              \n\n        March 26, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It Tears You Apart”\n\n\nPoverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System\n\n\n                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Migrants are also subject to new, often abusive administrative restrictions. Following the attack, Russian officials doubled down, fanning the fire of racist and anti-migrant public sentiments.

No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends. Because this tent you see in front of you won’t hold up in winter. The feeling of loss itself is beyond comparison to any other feeling. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens,

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nNiger Junta’s Release of Detainees Falls Short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4, 2025         |         News Release \n\nSouth Korea Court Removes President Yoon from Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         Dispatches \n\nGerman Proposal to Strip Citizenship Endangers Human Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 3, 2025         |         News Release \n\nIran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”\n\n\nIncreasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania\n\n\n                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.\n              \n\n        April 7, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”\n\n\nDisproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia\n\n\n                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.\n              \n\n        March 26, 2025\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It Tears You Apart”\n\n\nPoverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System\n\n\n                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Migrants are also subject to new, often abusive administrative restrictions. Following the attack, Russian officials doubled down, fanning the fire of racist and anti-migrant public sentiments.

We’ve just been targeted. We’ve just been targeted by warplanes. We are now with the Red Crescent crews. Thank God for your safety, Firas. Thank you, Firas. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends. Because this tent you see in front of you won’t hold up in winter. The feeling of loss itself is beyond comparison to any other feeling. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens,

No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning.

No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.VO:It is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.TITLE:Sara, Actor’s voiceSOUNDBITE: SaraIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends.

This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. Leaflets demanding that we evacuate the area. Here it is clearly as you can see. “Head towards...”this is the trap I’m talking about.VO:For the displacement of individuals to be lawful the following conditions are among those that must be met. Ensure people are moved safely, not separated from their families and have access to food,water, sanitation and healthcare. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. We found that repeated evacuations, mass destruction, and failure to provide safe passage or access to food, shelter or medical care make the displacement unlawful.VO:The level of intent and evidence of a state policy of forced displacement means these are war crimesand crimes against humanity.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDuring that time, there was chaos and panic. The street where I was walking was beingbombed, bombed, bombed everywhere.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryHere we are, displaced in the streets of Jabalia camp. No one knows anything about us,and we’ve lost all means of communications. We found a car on the street,and Hisham and I sat inside it. We don't know where to go, and this car isn't ours. But we opened its doors and sat inside. If someone finds this phone and we are no longer alive...let them tell the story and broadcast these recordings.SOUNDBITE: GhassanSuddenly, I saw a massive flash...When you are in the epicenter of an explosion, you feel absolutely nothing. You start checking your body to see if you've lost any parts of it.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryThis place was bombed last night. We are now in the early hours of dawn. I was inside this car. I was hit by shrapnel while sitting inside it. Can’t you see how bad it is [the destruction]? The post office building was targeted. While I was sitting inside this car.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI owe my survival to that car, which shielded us from the blast and the flying shrapnel. Afterward, I decided that we had to escape from the north at least. Our relationship to the camp is our life, it's [the camp] our whole life.SOUNDBITE: GhassanDisplacement feels like your soul is being torn from your body.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryEveryone is evacuating to different places. I just left the camp heading to Rafah after being bombed. We're riding a donkey-drawn cart because there are no cars.VO/ANIMATED MAPThe Salah al-Din Road is the main highway that runs north-south through the Gaza Strip.  Israeli evacuation orders started on October 13, 2023, running until January, 4, 2024. They instructed people to flee using this road and assured “safe passage.” Later evacuation orders told people to use a different route. Investigations by Human Rights Watch through interviews, satellite imagery, photos and videos demonstrate that this road was rarely, if ever, safe.   SOUNDBITE: GhassanHonestly, there are moments when you feel like you are alone on this planet. That day, the electricity was completely cut off from the northern Gaza Strip. And also the water, which the occupation[Israel] declared they had cut off from Gaza, and the communications and internet networks.SOUNDBITE: GhassanWhen I reached Rafah, I realized it was a trap. A mousetrap, as we call it. We lived in a house consisting of three floors. Over 200 members of my family had sought refuge in this house.Imagine, I was sleeping in a space only as large as my body. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. When did aid actually reach Gaza? I spent about a month in Rafah, standing in queues. I stood from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. to get some bread that I bought with my own money. News started spreading that they [Israeli forces] will invade Rafah, and I lived in the Brazil neighborhood on the border. This mix of news and the psychological state caused by the war forced us to flee. Especially that they [Israeli forces] wereheavily bombing apartments and homes. So, our option was to move into a tent with the rest of the displaced people.VO:Under the laws of war, Israel, as the occupying power, is only permitted to temporarily evacuatepeople under its control for specific reasons.  Israel must allow all the displaced to return once hostilities end. Instead, most of housing and civilian infrastructure has been destroyed so that much of Gaza is uninhabitable. Rather than meet its obligations to put in place basic protections to ensure access to food, water, sanitation and health care. Israel has taken steps to cut them off.SOUNDBITE: GhassanPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.TITLE:SARAVO/ANIMATED MAP:On December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, videoand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.TITLE:An actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity. Sara is not her real name. SOUNDBITE: SaraThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.VO/ANIMATED MAP:The evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations.

Israel has taken steps to cut them off.\n\nSOUNDBITE: Ghassan\n\nPeople began fleeing from the displacement camp in Rafah little by little. The camp was so crowded that you couldn't see the sand because there were so many tents. We arrived here [Deir al-Balah], and as you know, there is no truly safe place in Gaza. The shelling continues in this area. There is no safety. In truth, I don’t recall ever feeling safe since I was displaced from the north. I can’t sleep. My mind is always wandering.\n\nTITLE:\n\nSARA\n\nVO/ANIMATED MAP:\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the Israeli military released an interactive map dividing Gaza into 620 numbered blocks and continued to post and distribute evacuation orders referencing this block system. On December 7, 2023, Sara’s family home in Khan Younis was not in a block slated for evacuation. Human Rights Watch interviewed Sara and analyzed satellite imagery, video\n\nand photographs taken from that day. The information gathered indicates that the Israeli military knew or should have known that civilians were living in this block.\n\nTITLE:\n\nAn actor’s voice has been used to protect Sara’s identity.\n\nSara is not her real name.\n\nSOUNDBITE: Sara\n\nThe Israeli’s had renamed our area by blocks so everyone could keep track of where there could be strikes, we were living in block G, number 108. At around 4 p.m. I was coming home from work, what I saw as I approached was a massacre, it was hectic, everyone was screaming, and all I could see was fire and destruction.  I was scared because my kids were home and my sisters were taking refuge at my house, so we had about 20 people living in our apartment on the third floor.  Thank God my family in the apartment were ok, it was the building just next to us that had been hit. There was so much damage to the building I couldn’t enter, I could see bodies, people under the rubble. Many people died that day. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.\n\nVO/ANIMATED MAP:\n\nBy analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike.  Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. Just dozens of meters from that attack two additional strikes were carried out in the same timeframe. Analysis of satellite imagery shows that the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home was not an isolated incident.\n\nVO/ANIMATED MAP:\n\nThe evacuation system failed to keep people safe. Evacuation orders were inconsistent, inaccurate and frequently not communicated to civilians at all, or with enough time to allow evacuations. The sheer number of Palestinian civilians forced from their homes demonstrates that displacement in Gaza is widespread.\n\nVO:\n\nIt is also systematic and intentional and unlawful, forming part of Israeli state policy. This amounts to a crime against humanity. Israel should stop collectively punishing civilians in Gaza. Governments should publicly condemn Israel’s forced displacement of the civilian population as a war crime and crime against humanity and suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.\n\nTITLE:\n\nSara, Actor’s voice\n\nSOUNDBITE: Sara\n\nIn previous wars they did target specific places, but we would know in advance, and be given warning. This war is completely different. There is nowhere safe for us to go.\n\nSOUNDBITE: Ghassan\n\nI fear living through another displacement experience, and I fear that winter may come before the war ends. Because this tent you see in front of you won’t hold up in winter. The feeling of loss itself is beyond comparison to any other feeling. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,\n\nand I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.\n\nEND CREDITS:\n\nNarrator: Nadia Hardman\n\nProducer / Editor: Ellie

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore videos\n\nPlay video\nAustralia: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children\n07:40\n\n\nPlay video\nProtecting Rights Even in the Darkest Times\n03:40\n\n\nPlay video\nIraq Torture Survivors Await US Justice\n08:16\n\n\nPlay video\nDamascus Mass Grave Needs to be Preserved and Investigated\n05:34\n\n\nPlay video\nGaza: Israel’s Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\n13:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Why are exiled journalist Newton Ahmed Barry and 6 other journalists & activists on a wanted list?

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore videos\n\nPlay video\nAustralia: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children\n07:40\n\n\nPlay video\nProtecting Rights Even in the Darkest Times\n03:40\n\n\nPlay video\nIraq Torture Survivors Await US Justice\n08:16\n\n\nPlay video\nDamascus Mass Grave Needs to be Preserved and Investigated\n05:34\n\n\nPlay video\nGaza: Israel’s Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\n13:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Why are exiled journalist Newton Ahmed Barry and 6 other journalists & activists on a wanted list?

Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore videos\n\nPlay video\nAustralia: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children\n07:40\n\n\nPlay video\nProtecting Rights Even in the Darkest Times\n03:40\n\n\nPlay video\nIraq Torture Survivors Await US Justice\n08:16\n\n\nPlay video\nDamascus Mass Grave Needs to be Preserved and Investigated\n05:34\n\n\nPlay video\nGaza: Israel’s Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\n13:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Why are exiled journalist Newton Ahmed Barry and 6 other journalists & activists on a wanted list?

Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore videos\n\nPlay video\nAustralia: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children\n07:40\n\n\nPlay video\nProtecting Rights Even in the Darkest Times\n03:40\n\n\nPlay video\nIraq Torture Survivors Await US Justice\n08:16\n\n\nPlay video\nDamascus Mass Grave Needs to be Preserved and Investigated\n05:34\n\n\nPlay video\nGaza: Israel’s Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\n13:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Why are exiled journalist Newton Ahmed Barry and 6 other journalists & activists on a wanted list?

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore videos\n\nPlay video\nAustralia: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children\n07:40\n\n\nPlay video\nProtecting Rights Even in the Darkest Times\n03:40\n\n\nPlay video\nIraq Torture Survivors Await US Justice\n08:16\n\n\nPlay video\nDamascus Mass Grave Needs to be Preserved and Investigated\n05:34\n\n\nPlay video\nGaza: Israel’s Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\n13:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Why are exiled journalist Newton Ahmed Barry and 6 other journalists & activists on a wanted list?

In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore videos\n\nPlay video\nAustralia: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children\n07:40\n\n\nPlay video\nProtecting Rights Even in the Darkest Times\n03:40\n\n\nPlay video\nIraq Torture Survivors Await US Justice\n08:16\n\n\nPlay video\nDamascus Mass Grave Needs to be Preserved and Investigated\n05:34\n\n\nPlay video\nGaza: Israel’s Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\n13:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Why are exiled journalist Newton Ahmed Barry and 6 other journalists & activists on a wanted list?

Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore videos\n\nPlay video\nAustralia: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children\n07:40\n\n\nPlay video\nProtecting Rights Even in the Darkest Times\n03:40\n\n\nPlay video\nIraq Torture Survivors Await US Justice\n08:16\n\n\nPlay video\nDamascus Mass Grave Needs to be Preserved and Investigated\n05:34\n\n\nPlay video\nGaza: Israel’s Crimes Against Humanity in Gaza\n13:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n        Why are exiled journalist Newton Ahmed Barry and 6 other journalists & activists on a wanted list?
