  "text": "RightUp is Amnesty International’s first youth-led research project. An exhilarating initiative, inviting young minds to actively participate in our research processes. Gone are the days when only adults with specific qualifications held the reins of research. \nRightUp challenges the status quo and empowers this generation to contribute, learn, and shape the world. Get ready to revolutionize research with us!\nRightUp aims to recognise and resource youth expertise to proactively lead, contribute to, and shape Amnesty research. By providing training and skills-building programs, the project will support young Filipinos to conduct their own research on young people’s digital rights in the Philippines.\nImportance of Youth-Led Research  \nYoung people are experts in the realities, issues and challenges they experience. This means they are well placed to identify the key human rights issues that are affecting them and their peers. From a rights-based perspective, young people should be able to actively participate in research that will inform policies that will shape their lives, both now and in the future.\n\n\nWhat RightUp Will Be All About\n\n\n\n\n\nAmnesty International is looking for 8-10 talented young researchers to create the first youth-led research in the Philippines.\nAs part of the RightUp Youth Research Team, you will embark on a research journey focusing on the role that technology plays in the lives of young Filipinos and the impact it has on your rights and well-being. While the general topic will revolve around online harassment of young activists, the approach, specific focus, and shape of the research will be decided entirely by you (and the rest of your team)! \nYou will be supported by a team of experts from Amnesty who will provide you with training and guidance as you go through the entire participatory action research process towards *fingers-crossed* publication–which may be a formal report but could also even be a zine, a documentary, or other creative youth-friendly output. Please note however that we do recognize the value in intergenerational collaboration so you can expect sessions that will help you produce outputs that speak to decision-makers and power-holders.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Amnesty Will Provide for You\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selected candidates will participate in several training sessions both online and offline, facilitated by experts from Amnesty International and its partners.  The training program is designed to provide you with additional insight into human rights, digital rights, and the participatory action research methodology. It will also equip you with the technical skills needed to execute youth-led research and the soft skills that will help you work successfully together as a unit.\nThe Youth Team will also have the support and focused mentorship of Amnesty staff and members–from the Philippines and our international office–throughout every phase of the project.  Furthermore, sufficient funding will be given to the team to manage and use in making the campaign they designed a reality. This is a volunteer post; no monetary compensation will be provided, but volunteers will receive regular stipends to meet what you need to work on the research.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Amnesty Will Require of You\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to be prepared to commit around 25 hours per month on a voluntary basis from September 2023 to March 2025.
