  "text": "@Gabriel Justin Cruz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Names changed to protect identity   Amnesty International’s first ever youth-led report reveals that online harassment by the Philippine authorities, including the practice of “red-tagging” or labelling individuals as communists, creates a climate of fear that is deterring young human rights defenders from engaging in activism and expressing themselves freely. In the report, “Left to their own devices: The chilling effects of online harassment among young human rights defenders (YHRDs) in the Philippines,” young activists aged 18 to 24 shared experiences of being red-tagged, doxed with personal information published online without their consent, and trolled. They describe how online harassment has led to self-censorship, infringed their rights to freedom of expression and association, and in some cases, forced them to abandon their work as activists or journalists. “The chilling effect of online harassment severely impairs the rights of these young human rights defenders. It not only threatens the individual, but also undermines their capacity to do their work to defend human rights. Mia Tonogbanua, Amnesty Philippines Vice-Chairperson and former Youth Board RepresentativeThe report highlights how young activists’ age, sexual orientation, student status and institutional affiliations magnify the risks and impact of online harassment that they experience. This current research is part of RightUp, Amnesty International’s first youth-led research project in which young voices, often overlooked in traditional human rights work, take centre stage. Nine young researchers documented and investigated the experiences of YHRDs through desk research, an online questionnaire, and interviews with young people aged 18 to 24. Amnesty International provided resources, guidance, and technical support. Death threats, self-censorship and fear State-sponsored online harassment has had disturbing effects on young activists. They describe suffering psychological distress, being isolated from families and social circles and feeling that their contribution to human rights work was devalued.  Habagat*, a student activist, received death threats after being publicly red-tagged on the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict’s (NTF-ELCAC) Facebook page. “I couldn’t sleep properly for three weeks after it happened,” he recalled. “I was constantly afraid for my safety.”  NTF-ELCAC is a task force established by Philippine government in 2018 as part of its response to the ongoing communist insurgency in the country. Since its creation, it has been criticized by activists and human rights groups, including Amnesty International, for engaging in red-tagging. Environmental defender Marisol* said she had resorted to “playing it safe” and self-censorship to minimize backlash over controversial issues. However, this approach has left her conflicted: “It’s like you’re not taking a stand on what needs to be done.” Sarita*, a young advocate for peace and security in southern Philippines, said online harassment “made me feel so weak, so inferior compared to these politicians with all the powers that they have.” Online harassment affects various rights, including the right to freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, health, remedy, non-discrimination and the right to defend human rights. Young activists also spoke of a pervasive fear of participating in public discussions. Some of the YHRDs attributed this to concerns about reprisals from the authorities in the form of online harassment. Many expressed doubts about the value of their voices and expertise as young people in the face of violence and hatred in online spaces. A call for collective action and accountability Despite these challenges, YHRDs have found ways to adapt their approach to ensure they can continue their human rights advocacy. These include establishing internal well-being committees, enforcing safety protocols, and accessing mental health services.  “Being a young human rights defender in the Philippines is not safe, comfortable, or ideal.

These include establishing internal well-being committees, enforcing safety protocols, and accessing mental health services.\n\n“Being a young human rights defender in the Philippines is not safe, comfortable, or ideal. Yet…young activists continue to fight, spurred onwards by strategies for care and commitment to justice.\n\nThe Philippine government has consistently failed to fulfill its obligations to protect the rights of human rights defenders in the country. Perpetrators of online harassment are not effectively held accountable, while YHRDs must cope with the consequences of this harassment without sufficient support or protection.\n\nAt the time of publication, the Philippine government had not responded to a request for comment on the findings of Amnesty’s report.\n\nAmnesty International urges the Philippine government to end state-sponsored red-tagging, intimidation, harassment, threats or attacks against activists, including young human rights defenders.\n\nThis research builds on findings of previous Amnesty International investigations, including how the two successive governments of President Duterte and President Marcos Jr have weaponized digital tools, misinformation and vague anti-terror laws to create a climate of fear and intimidation among young human rights defenders in the Philippines.",

In the report, “Left to their own devices: The chilling effects of online harassment among young human rights defenders (YHRDs) in the Philippines,” young activists aged 18 to 24 shared experiences of being red-tagged, doxed with personal information published online without their consent, and trolled. “The chilling effect of online harassment severely impairs the rights of these young human rights defenders.
