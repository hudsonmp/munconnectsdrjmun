This event will serve as a platform for dialogue and action regarding the state of the world’s glaciers and their impacts on global water security, communities, and ecosystems.         ©Daniel Kordan20 March 2025 - 21 March 2025 EventCelebrations of the 1st World Day for Glaciers and World Water Day20 March 2025 - 8:00 am - 21 March 2025 - 6:00 pmLocationParis, France Rooms :Paris Type :Cat VIII - Symposia Arrangement type :In-PersonAdd to calendarDownload eventAdd to googleAdd to OutlookAdd to Office365As part of the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation 2025, a joint celebration of the World Day for Glaciers and World Water Day will be organized to highlight the accelerating threat of glacier melt and its impact on water security, communities and ecosystems. With glaciers melting at record rates, this joint celebration will underscore the importance of glaciers as “water towers of the world” for billions of people who rely on them. World leaders, policymakers, scientists, civil society and advocacy groups will come together to discuss the importance of glaciers in global water systems, their impact on ecosystems, sea levels, and human societies, and to drive concerted action to protect water supplies and glaciers for future generations.The event will also mark the launch of the 2025 World Water Development Report, themed \"High Mountains and Glaciers\". The report emphasizes glaciers' role in sustaining water supplies and maintaining ecosystem stability, offering data-driven insights to guide sustainable water management and adaptation strategies for communities worldwide. Further, the event will lay the foundation for the Decade of Action for Cryospheric Sciences (2025-2034), fostering international cooperation in scientific research and monitoring to address the impacts of cryosphere changes. More information and programme         Register for the eventThe 1st World Day for Glaciers and World Water Day 2025 is open to all.

The report emphasizes glaciers' role in sustaining water supplies and maintaining ecosystem stability, offering data-driven insights to guide sustainable water management and adaptation strategies for communities worldwide. Further, the event will lay the foundation for the Decade of Action for Cryospheric Sciences (2025-2034), fostering international cooperation in scientific research and monitoring to address the impacts of cryosphere changes. More information and programme         Register for the eventThe 1st World Day for Glaciers and World Water Day 2025 is open to all.
