The interim government must strike a delicate balance in dealing with the myriad challenges it faces. Donors should give it the help it needs, lest this promising project of state building descend into a fiasco.\n\n\n\n\nArabic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodcast\n\n              / Middle East & North Africa\n22 March 2025\n\n\n\nIsrael Goes Back to War in Gaza\n\n\nThis week on Hold Your Fire!, Richard Atwood speaks to Crisis Group experts Max Rodenbeck, Mairav Zonszein, Amjad Iraqi and Michael Wahid Hanna about Israel’s return to war in Gaza, the implications for the strip’s inhabitants, the U.S. air raids on the Houthis in Yemen and President Donald Trump’s Middle East policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n              / Middle East & North Africa\n21 March 2025\n\n\n\nCalming the Red Sea’s Turbulent Waters\n\n\nFresh exchanges of fire between Yemen’s Houthis, on one side, and the U.S. and Israel, on the other, have put Red Sea security back in the spotlight. Big challenges lie ahead in stopping this cycle and curbing the military build-up in these strategic waters.\n\n\n\n\nArabic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert\n\n              / Middle East & North Africa\n21 March 2025\n\n\n\nStopping Israel’s War in Gaza\n\n\nOn 18 March, Israel resumed bombing Gaza, upending a two-month ceasefire. Returning to war promises little but more death and destruction. The U.S. should insist on restoring the truce and endorse the Arab League plan for Gaza as the basis for a more permanent peace.\n\n\n\n\nArabic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Horizon\n\n              / From Early Warning to Early Action\n19 March 2025\n\n\n\nOn the Horizon: March-August 2025\n\n\nThis edition of On the Horizon includes entries on Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Syria, sounding the alarm about conflicts and crises that may emerge in the next three to six months.

This approach risks pushing Syria toward the very scenarios Israel worries about.\n\n\n\n\nArabic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\n\n              / Middle East & North Africa\n10 March 2025\n\n\n\nFinding a Path through a Perilous Moment for Post-Assad Syria\n\n\nBloody clashes in parts of Syria have brought communal tensions to a head. If the interim government does not act swiftly to punish the wrongdoers, address Alawite anxieties and better ensure public safety, the country’s transition out of civil war could be in serious trouble.\n\n\n\n\nArabic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        See More Updates\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nOur People\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoost Hiltermann\n\n\n              Program Director, Middle East and North Africa\n          \n\n\nJoost Hiltermann\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYasmine Farouk\n\n\n              Project Director, Gulf and Arabian Peninsula\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiccardo Fabiani\n\n\n              Project Director, North Africa\n          \n\n\nRiccardo Fabiani\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Rodenbeck\n\n\n              Project Director, Israel/Palestine\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAli Vaez\n\n\n              Senior Adviser to the President & Project Director, Iran\n          \n\n\nAli Vaez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeiko Wimmen\n\n\n              Project Director, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon\n          \n\n\nHeiko Wimmen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichaël Béchir Ayari\n\n\n              Senior Analyst, Tunisia\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristina Boutros\n\n\n              Senior Communications and Advocacy Officer, MENA\n          \n\n\nChristina Boutros\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad more\n\n\n\n\n\n            See all our people\n\nMiddle East & North Africa\n\nMiddle East & North Africa\n\nMiddle East & North Africa\n\nVisual Explainers\n\n                  / Middle East & North Africa\n\n\nThe Houthis’ Red Sea Attacks Explained\n\nIn October 2023, as Israel bombarded Gaza in response to Hamas’s attacks, the Houthis began firing missiles and armed drones at Israeli targets, and later Israel-linked cargo ships in the Red Sea.
