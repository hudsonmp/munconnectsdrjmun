Belarus 6-7 March hosted Min Aung Hlaing in state visit.Major earthquake in central Myanmar left thousands in need of aid. 7.7-magnitude earthquake – marking largest recorded in Myanmar since at least 1912 – and aftershocks 28 March inflicted massive damage across Mandalay city and other central areas, killing at least 2,700 with death toll likely to rise sharply; humanitarian aid and post-reconstruction effort will likely be severely hampered in coming weeks and months due to complex political and security environment.\n\nThe Arakan Army continued to battle the regime in Rakhine state, the regime leader made his first official state visits to Russia and Belarus, and the largest earthquake for over a century devastated central areas.\n\nIn Rakhine state (west), heavy fighting continued between Arakan Army and military. Arakan Army continued assault on military in Kyaukphyu town and state capital Sittwe, 3 March capturing four outposts near Danyawady Naval Regional Command, which prompted hundreds of regime troops to attempt counteroffensive. Military escalated its airstrikes, drone attacks and shelling, inflicting heavy damage on nearby communities. Arakan Army continued to advance in neighbouring Magway, Bago and Ayeyarwady regions.\n\nIn Kayin state (east), hostilities escalated between military and armed group. Regime continued efforts to retake control of Asia Highway, leading to near-daily clashes with Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). After regime late Feb allegedly torched nearly 200 homes in village along highway, KNLA and allied groups early March reportedly captured Pu Lu Tu base in Hlaingbwe township following week-long offensive, displacing 550 people into Thailand.\n\nIn Shan state (north), tensions spiked between ethnic armed groups. Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) 7 March raided Kachin Independence Army (KIA) office in Kutkai township, forcibly removing around 40 KIA soldiers, as tensions over competing territorial claims escalated. Meanwhile, TNLA and military continued to clash in Nawnghkio township ahead of planned ceasefire discussions in April brokered by China.\n\nRegime leader received warm welcome in Russia and Belarus. State Administration Council head Min Aung Hlaing 4 March met Russian President Putin in Russian capital Moscow during his first visit with full honours as head of state; Min Aung Hlaing expressed support for Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, while Putin pointed to growing economic ties. Belarus 6-7 March hosted Min Aung Hlaing in state visit.\n\nMajor earthquake in central Myanmar left thousands in need of aid. 7.7-magnitude earthquake – marking largest recorded in Myanmar since at least 1912 – and aftershocks 28 March inflicted massive damage across Mandalay city and other central areas, killing at least 2,700 with death toll likely to rise sharply; humanitarian aid and post-reconstruction effort will likely be severely hampered in coming weeks and months due to complex political and security environment.\n\nIn The News\n      \n\n\n\n\n      4 Apr 2025\n    \n\n            Airstrikes don't directly affect relief efforts [in Myanmar].

    "description": "The 2021 coup d’état that deposed the Aung San Suu Kyi administration has unleashed unprecedented levels of violence, displacing more than 3 million people and plunging the country into economic crisis. Most of Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups, which long predate the coup, have been drawn into the conflict, and many have aligned themselves with newly formed resistance forces; several are also backing the opposition National Unity Government. The military has adopted brutal tactics, including targeted atrocities and indiscriminate airstrikes on civilians, in a desperate attempt to hold onto power. But significant areas of Myanmar, particularly in the borderlands, have fallen to non-state forces, some of which have carved out quasi-states. Since late 2023, Rakhine State has seen some of the worst violence, further diminishing prospects for the return of almost one million Rohingya languishing in camps in Bangladesh. Through field research and advocacy, Crisis Group works to understand the new violent dynamics unleashed by the coup and to mitigate the impact on the country’s people.",
