More than 495,815 Haitians call the Dominican Republic home, according to official statistics.\nRights groups have condemned the expulsions, accusing the Dominican authorities of enacting a racist immigration policy that invokes a wider, historical trend of anti-Haitian discrimination.\nA majority of the population in the Dominican Republic identifies as mixed race, while Haiti has a predominantly Black population.\nHaitian migration to the Dominican Republic began en masse following the US occupation of Haiti in 1915. But while many Haitians have lived in the country for decades, fear-mongering around the “Haitianisation” of Dominican society persists.\nSome critics even accuse the Dominican government of racially profiling Black Dominicans in its expulsions.\nAmid a wave of deportations in 2022, William Charpantier — a coordinator for MENAMIRD, a national roundtable for migrants and refugees in the Dominican Republic — told Al Jazeera that “all those who look like Haitians” were being rounded up in the streets and detained.\n“These deportations have resulted in the separation of families. People with valid documents have been deported, people who were born here in the Dominican Republic have been deported,” Charpantier said at the time.\n“These aren’t deportations. It’s persecution based on race.”\nAs the violence and instability in Haiti escalates, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) has urged governments around the world not to deport Haitians back to the country.
