Gangs, which control 85 percent of the capital Port-au-Prince, aim to seize total control of the city.\nYoung boys are often used as informers “because they’re invisible and not seen as a threat”, said Geeta Narayan, UNICEF’s representative in Haiti. Some are given weapons and forced to participate in attacks. Girls, meanwhile, are forced to cook, clean and even used as so-called “wives” for gang members.
