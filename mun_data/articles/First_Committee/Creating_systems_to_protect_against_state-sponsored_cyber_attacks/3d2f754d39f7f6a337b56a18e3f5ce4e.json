The medics were wearing highly reflective uniforms and were inside clearly identifiable rescue vehicles before they were shot by Israeli forces in Rafah’s Tal as-Sultan neighbourhood.\n \n\n\n\n \nAccording to the PRCS, the convoy came under heavy gunfire for about five minutes. It said communication between the team and the central dispatch centre “confirms that the gunfire continued for no less than two hours” with continuous shooting heard until contact was completely lost with one of the medics.

The survivor also said he was used by Israeli officers as a “human shield” before being able to escape.\n“It is no longer sufficient to speak of respecting the international law and Geneva Convention,” al-Khatib told reporters from el-Bireh in the occupied West Bank. “It is now required from the international community and the UN Security Council to implement the necessary punishment against all who are responsible.”\n‘Who is telling the truth?’\nAl-Khatib also called on the international community to safeguard aid workers and prevent the targeting of hospitals, medical centres and ambulances.\nHe also requested that Israel disclose the whereabouts of the PRCS staff who are still missing.\nThe PRCS lost eight of its workers in the attack. Six members of the Palestinian Civil Defence agency and an employee of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, were also killed.\nThe Israeli military had claimed its soldiers “did not randomly attack” any ambulances, insisting they fired on “terrorists” approaching them in “suspicious vehicles”.\n“Several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward [Israeli army] troops without headlights or emergency signals,” it said.\nBut al-Khatib refuted this claim, saying the ambulances had emergency lights on.\n“We at PRCS have been accustomed to Israel’s false allegations and fabricated stories with regards to what goes on in the Gaza Strip,” al-Khatib said.

The attack was decried by the Civil Defence, Gaza’s Government Media Office, Hamas and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk, who said the incident raises concern over possible “war crimes” by the Israeli military. Meanwhile, Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said that since Israel broke the ceasefire in Gaza on March 18 and resumed its war on the enclave, Israeli air attacks have hit “densely populated areas” with “patients killed in their hospital beds, ambulances shot at, first responders killed”.
