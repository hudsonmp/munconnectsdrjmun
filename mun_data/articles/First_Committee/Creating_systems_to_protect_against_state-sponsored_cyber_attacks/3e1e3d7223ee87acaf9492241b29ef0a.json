A Call to Action & Collective Resistance 🔥\n\nAs RightsCon 2025 comes to a close, I am filled with gratitude, urgency, and a renewed commitment to collective action. Over the past four days, we have gathered as a community of activists, technologists, policymakers, and advocates, confronting the challenges that threaten our movement—from digital authoritarianism to funding freezes that are reshaping the digital rights landscape.\n\n🌎 Overcoming Differences, Strengthening Our Movement\nMany of us began our journeys in grassroots activism—in the streets, in classrooms, in communities fighting for justice. I, too, started at the grassroots, and I stand here today as Executive Director of Access Now because of the collective power of this movement.\n\nBut we cannot ignore the growing threats to our ecosystem:\n⚠️ The funding crisis has been at the heart of our conversations this week.\n⚠️ Organizations under attack are struggling to advocate for themselves without facing severe repression.\n⚠️ External forces seek to divide us, pushing us into survival mode instead of collaboration.\n\n💜 Thank You to the RightsCon Community\nTo every activist, advocate, technologist, donor, volunteer, and frontline defender—this week was possible because of you. Your resilience, collaboration, and refusal to back down inspire me daily.\n\n🔗 The work does not end here—it continues in every battle for digital rights, in every demand for accountability, in every voice that refuses to be silenced.

We are the global majority, and the Asia Pacific region is the majority of the global majority. It’s time to ensure we have a proportionate say in the resolution of issues impacting each and all of us.”\n\n3️⃣ “In this digital era, are we moving toward a more tolerant, democratic, and open society, or are we moving backward? Those who live in conflict, are they going to be more liberalized or are they facing more restrictions because of technology?\" asked Cheng Li-Chiun, Vice Premier of Executive Yuan.\n\n4️⃣ “We all are very enraged with the current situation in the world, and this is the time we have to shift from our shared rage to actions and our solidarity into strategies. The people of Myanmar are still standing after 4 years, but we shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Palestine shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)\n\n5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. \n\n6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”\n\n7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. Watch the replay now:\n🔗 https://buff.ly/3D5CuhM \n\n8️⃣ “The challenges we face are shared with the world. [...] Maybe after RightsCon, we could initiate new ways to change the world.” (Singing Li, CEO at Open Culture Foundation)\n\n9️⃣ &  🔟 Last but not least, Abao and the Chorus of Indigenous Voices blew us away with their performance of Indigenous Taiwanese music.\n\nWere you as inspired as we were?

A Call to Action & Collective Resistance 🔥\n\nAs RightsCon 2025 comes to a close, I am filled with gratitude, urgency, and a renewed commitment to collective action. Over the past four days, we have gathered as a community of activists, technologists, policymakers, and advocates, confronting the challenges that threaten our movement—from digital authoritarianism to funding freezes that are reshaping the digital rights landscape.\n\n🌎 Overcoming Differences, Strengthening Our Movement\nMany of us began our journeys in grassroots activism—in the streets, in classrooms, in communities fighting for justice. I, too, started at the grassroots, and I stand here today as Executive Director of Access Now because of the collective power of this movement.\n\nBut we cannot ignore the growing threats to our ecosystem:\n⚠️ The funding crisis has been at the heart of our conversations this week.\n⚠️ Organizations under attack are struggling to advocate for themselves without facing severe repression.\n⚠️ External forces seek to divide us, pushing us into survival mode instead of collaboration.\n\n💜 Thank You to the RightsCon Community\nTo every activist, advocate, technologist, donor, volunteer, and frontline defender—this week was possible because of you. Your resilience, collaboration, and refusal to back down inspire me daily.\n\n🔗 The work does not end here—it continues in every battle for digital rights, in every demand for accountability, in every voice that refuses to be silenced.

We are the global majority, and the Asia Pacific region is the majority of the global majority. It’s time to ensure we have a proportionate say in the resolution of issues impacting each and all of us.”\n\n3️⃣ “In this digital era, are we moving toward a more tolerant, democratic, and open society, or are we moving backward? Those who live in conflict, are they going to be more liberalized or are they facing more restrictions because of technology?\" asked Cheng Li-Chiun, Vice Premier of Executive Yuan.\n\n4️⃣ “We all are very enraged with the current situation in the world, and this is the time we have to shift from our shared rage to actions and our solidarity into strategies. The people of Myanmar are still standing after 4 years, but we shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Palestine shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)\n\n5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. \n\n6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”\n\n7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. Watch the replay now:\n🔗 https://buff.ly/3D5CuhM \n\n8️⃣ “The challenges we face are shared with the world. [...] Maybe after RightsCon, we could initiate new ways to change the world.” (Singing Li, CEO at Open Culture Foundation)\n\n9️⃣ &  🔟 Last but not least, Abao and the Chorus of Indigenous Voices blew us away with their performance of Indigenous Taiwanese music.\n\nWere you as inspired as we were?

A Call to Action & Collective Resistance 🔥\n\nAs RightsCon 2025 comes to a close, I am filled with gratitude, urgency, and a renewed commitment to collective action. Over the past four days, we have gathered as a community of activists, technologists, policymakers, and advocates, confronting the challenges that threaten our movement—from digital authoritarianism to funding freezes that are reshaping the digital rights landscape.\n\n🌎 Overcoming Differences, Strengthening Our Movement\nMany of us began our journeys in grassroots activism—in the streets, in classrooms, in communities fighting for justice. I, too, started at the grassroots, and I stand here today as Executive Director of Access Now because of the collective power of this movement.\n\nBut we cannot ignore the growing threats to our ecosystem:\n⚠️ The funding crisis has been at the heart of our conversations this week.\n⚠️ Organizations under attack are struggling to advocate for themselves without facing severe repression.\n⚠️ External forces seek to divide us, pushing us into survival mode instead of collaboration.\n\n💜 Thank You to the RightsCon Community\nTo every activist, advocate, technologist, donor, volunteer, and frontline defender—this week was possible because of you. Your resilience, collaboration, and refusal to back down inspire me daily.\n\n🔗 The work does not end here—it continues in every battle for digital rights, in every demand for accountability, in every voice that refuses to be silenced.

We are the global majority, and the Asia Pacific region is the majority of the global majority. It’s time to ensure we have a proportionate say in the resolution of issues impacting each and all of us.”\n\n3️⃣ “In this digital era, are we moving toward a more tolerant, democratic, and open society, or are we moving backward? Those who live in conflict, are they going to be more liberalized or are they facing more restrictions because of technology?\" asked Cheng Li-Chiun, Vice Premier of Executive Yuan.\n\n4️⃣ “We all are very enraged with the current situation in the world, and this is the time we have to shift from our shared rage to actions and our solidarity into strategies. The people of Myanmar are still standing after 4 years, but we shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Palestine shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)\n\n5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. \n\n6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”\n\n7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. Watch the replay now:\n🔗 https://buff.ly/3D5CuhM \n\n8️⃣ “The challenges we face are shared with the world. [...] Maybe after RightsCon, we could initiate new ways to change the world.” (Singing Li, CEO at Open Culture Foundation)\n\n9️⃣ &  🔟 Last but not least, Abao and the Chorus of Indigenous Voices blew us away with their performance of Indigenous Taiwanese music.\n\nWere you as inspired as we were?

A Call to Action & Collective Resistance 🔥\n\nAs RightsCon 2025 comes to a close, I am filled with gratitude, urgency, and a renewed commitment to collective action. Over the past four days, we have gathered as a community of activists, technologists, policymakers, and advocates, confronting the challenges that threaten our movement—from digital authoritarianism to funding freezes that are reshaping the digital rights landscape.\n\n🌎 Overcoming Differences, Strengthening Our Movement\nMany of us began our journeys in grassroots activism—in the streets, in classrooms, in communities fighting for justice. I, too, started at the grassroots, and I stand here today as Executive Director of Access Now because of the collective power of this movement.\n\nBut we cannot ignore the growing threats to our ecosystem:\n⚠️ The funding crisis has been at the heart of our conversations this week.\n⚠️ Organizations under attack are struggling to advocate for themselves without facing severe repression.\n⚠️ External forces seek to divide us, pushing us into survival mode instead of collaboration.\n\n💜 Thank You to the RightsCon Community\nTo every activist, advocate, technologist, donor, volunteer, and frontline defender—this week was possible because of you. Your resilience, collaboration, and refusal to back down inspire me daily.\n\n🔗 The work does not end here—it continues in every battle for digital rights, in every demand for accountability, in every voice that refuses to be silenced. Let’s move forward together.\n\n#RightsCon2025 #DigitalRights #CallToAction #ResistAndMobilize #FundingJustice\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    31\n              \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n                2 Comments\n            \n      \n \n\n\n\n\n\n      Like\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Comment\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n      Share\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              RightsCon\n            \n \n\n                2,075 followers\n            \n \n\n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      1mo\n  \n                    \n\n                      Edited\n                    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this post\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n🎊 Here are our highlights from the #RightsCon2025 Opening Ceremony:\n\n1️⃣ We were warmly welcomed by Bi-khim Hsiao, Vice President of Taiwan: “Welcome to Taipei, welcome to RightsCon, and may this summit be a catalyst for change, and may our collective experts inspire a more open, inclusive and rights respecting digital future for all.” \n\n2️⃣ Access Now’s Zhixin Liu and Raman Jit Singh Chima set the tone for our return to the region after a decade: “The Asia Pacific region [...] arguably, [...] is already the present of our internet. We are the global majority, and the Asia Pacific region is the majority of the global majority. It’s time to ensure we have a proportionate say in the resolution of issues impacting each and all of us.”\n\n3️⃣ “In this digital era, are we moving toward a more tolerant, democratic, and open society, or are we moving backward? Those who live in conflict, are they going to be more liberalized or are they facing more restrictions because of technology?\" asked Cheng Li-Chiun, Vice Premier of Executive Yuan.\n\n4️⃣ “We all are very enraged with the current situation in the world, and this is the time we have to shift from our shared rage to actions and our solidarity into strategies. The people of Myanmar are still standing after 4 years, but we shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Palestine shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)\n\n5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. \n\n6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”\n\n7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. Watch the replay now:\n🔗 https://buff.ly/3D5CuhM \n\n8️⃣ “The challenges we face are shared with the world. [...] Maybe after RightsCon, we could initiate new ways to change the world.” (Singing Li, CEO at Open Culture Foundation)\n\n9️⃣ &  🔟 Last but not least, Abao and the Chorus of Indigenous Voices blew us away with their performance of Indigenous Taiwanese music.\n\nWere you as inspired as we were?

A Call to Action & Collective Resistance 🔥\n\nAs RightsCon 2025 comes to a close, I am filled with gratitude, urgency, and a renewed commitment to collective action. Over the past four days, we have gathered as a community of activists, technologists, policymakers, and advocates, confronting the challenges that threaten our movement—from digital authoritarianism to funding freezes that are reshaping the digital rights landscape.\n\n🌎 Overcoming Differences, Strengthening Our Movement\nMany of us began our journeys in grassroots activism—in the streets, in classrooms, in communities fighting for justice. I, too, started at the grassroots, and I stand here today as Executive Director of Access Now because of the collective power of this movement.\n\nBut we cannot ignore the growing threats to our ecosystem:\n⚠️ The funding crisis has been at the heart of our conversations this week.\n⚠️ Organizations under attack are struggling to advocate for themselves without facing severe repression.\n⚠️ External forces seek to divide us, pushing us into survival mode instead of collaboration.\n\n💜 Thank You to the RightsCon Community\nTo every activist, advocate, technologist, donor, volunteer, and frontline defender—this week was possible because of you. Your resilience, collaboration, and refusal to back down inspire me daily.\n\n🔗 The work does not end here—it continues in every battle for digital rights, in every demand for accountability, in every voice that refuses to be silenced.

We are the global majority, and the Asia Pacific region is the majority of the global majority. It’s time to ensure we have a proportionate say in the resolution of issues impacting each and all of us.”\n\n3️⃣ “In this digital era, are we moving toward a more tolerant, democratic, and open society, or are we moving backward? Those who live in conflict, are they going to be more liberalized or are they facing more restrictions because of technology?\" asked Cheng Li-Chiun, Vice Premier of Executive Yuan.\n\n4️⃣ “We all are very enraged with the current situation in the world, and this is the time we have to shift from our shared rage to actions and our solidarity into strategies. The people of Myanmar are still standing after 4 years, but we shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Palestine shouldn’t be standing alone. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)\n\n5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. \n\n6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”\n\n7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. Watch the replay now:\n🔗 https://buff.ly/3D5CuhM \n\n8️⃣ “The challenges we face are shared with the world. [...] Maybe after RightsCon, we could initiate new ways to change the world.” (Singing Li, CEO at Open Culture Foundation)\n\n9️⃣ &  🔟 Last but not least, Abao and the Chorus of Indigenous Voices blew us away with their performance of Indigenous Taiwanese music.\n\nWere you as inspired as we were?

Over the past four days, we have gathered as a community of activists, technologists, policymakers, and advocates, confronting the challenges that threaten our movement—from digital authoritarianism to funding freezes that are reshaping the digital rights landscape.\n\n🌎 Overcoming Differences, Strengthening Our Movement\nMany of us began our journeys in grassroots activism—in the streets, in classrooms, in communities fighting for justice. I, too, started at the grassroots, and I stand here today as Executive Director of Access Now because of the collective power of this movement.\n\nBut we cannot ignore the growing threats to our ecosystem:\n⚠️ The funding crisis has been at the heart of our conversations this week.\n⚠️ Organizations under attack are struggling to advocate for themselves without facing severe repression.\n⚠️ External forces seek to divide us, pushing us into survival mode instead of collaboration.\n\n💜 Thank You to the RightsCon Community\nTo every activist, advocate, technologist, donor, volunteer, and frontline defender—this week was possible because of you. Your resilience, collaboration, and refusal to back down inspire me daily.\n\n🔗 The work does not end here—it continues in every battle for digital rights, in every demand for accountability, in every voice that refuses to be silenced.

It’s time to ensure we have a proportionate say in the resolution of issues impacting each and all of us.”\n\n3️⃣ “In this digital era, are we moving toward a more tolerant, democratic, and open society, or are we moving backward? Those who live in conflict, are they going to be more liberalized or are they facing more restrictions because of technology?\" asked Cheng Li-Chiun, Vice Premier of Executive Yuan.\n\n4️⃣ “We all are very enraged with the current situation in the world, and this is the time we have to shift from our shared rage to actions and our solidarity into strategies.

Taiwan: “Welcome to Taipei, welcome to RightsCon, and may this summit be a catalyst for change, and may our collective experts inspire a more open, inclusive and rights respecting digital future for all.” \n\n2️⃣ Access Now’s Zhixin Liu and Raman Jit Singh Chima set the tone for our return to the region after a decade: “The Asia Pacific region [...] arguably, [...] is already the present of our
