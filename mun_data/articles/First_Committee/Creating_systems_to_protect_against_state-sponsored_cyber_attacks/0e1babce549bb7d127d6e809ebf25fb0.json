Greece has accused Turkey of “weaponising” and “instrumentalising” them.\n\nRather than relaxing restrictions, the government is, tightening its grip on the management of refugees.\n\nThis year it took over the running of 26 mainland camps from the IOM. On October 26, it further sidelined the UN by assuming responsibility for the dispensation of cash assistance provided by the European Union.\n\nThe transition period has resulted in those who are eligible for cash not receiving any for two months, contributing further to the food crisis. Self-styled groceries and restaurants refugees operate inside the camps are dependent on these cash handouts, as well as remittances from overseas.\n\nApostolos Veizis, who heads the organisation INTERSOS in Greece, believes this treatment of refugees is part of a broader strategy of discouragement.\n\n“After five years of those camps on the mainland, we are discussing a situation as though it was an emergency of 2015 or 2016,” he says, referring to the years of high flows of refugees into the EU. “This is an emergency that was not created because of a lack of resources. This is being created probably because there are politics beyond and before people.”\n\n“The objective is those people are not supposed to stay in the camp,” Veizis says.\n\nLast July, the government encouraged thousands of destitute refugees to get off the streets and take up residence in camps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Thousands of recognised refugees, including mothers with young children, pregnant women, elderly and chronic patients, found themselves without shelter, living in public squares for prolonged periods of time,” said Spathari. “Having no viable alternatives, they were compelled to return to camps in order to have access to the bare minimum, water, food, shelter and primary healthcare.”\n\nAid groups like the IRC point to a different possible future.\n\n“We’ve seen asylum seekers who, because they were supported by an NGO or municipality, not the state, don’t even need that cash assistance,” said Roussou. “They can go get a job, rent an apartment and live independently. People are perfectly capable of standing on their own two feet with a bit of support.”\n\nSource: Al Jazeera\n\naj-logoaj-logoaj-logo\n\naj-logo\n\naj-logo\n\naj-logo\n\naj-logo\n\naj-logo\n\naj-logo\n\nSponsored Content  Advertisement\n\nSponsored Content\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement",
