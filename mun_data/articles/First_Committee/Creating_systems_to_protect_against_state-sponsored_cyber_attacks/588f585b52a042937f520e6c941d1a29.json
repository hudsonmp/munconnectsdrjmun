companies doing?\n\nArtificial intelligence and human rights\n\n\n\nThe development and use of AI must be transparent, accountable, and work in public interest. Deploying AI and automated decision-making, without adequate safeguards, checks and balances can facilitate human rights violations, exacerbate existing societal power imbalances, and create new risks, disproportionately affecting marginalized people and communities. We urge governments and companies to develop and enforce global AI governance frameworks that are binding, enforceable, and rooted in human rights law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy human rights must be at the core of AI governance\nCivil society has been consistently advocating for human rights-centric AI governance. But this effort is under threat from several angles; and with it, any chance of achieving a reality in which AI development serves people, instead of surveilling and exploiting them.\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPOTLIGHT: EU AI ACT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe EU AI Act: a failure for human rights, a victory for industry and law enforcement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nLoopholes and exemptions: the EU has voted to adopt an AI Act that fails to protect people from harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe EU AI Act proposal: a timeline\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nA summary of our proposed amendments to the draft EU AI Act and a timeline of our related commentary and recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe EU AI Act: How to (truly) protect people on the move\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe EU AI Act is supposed to protect the rights of everyone impacted by AI systems.

companies doing?\n\nArtificial intelligence and human rights\n\n\n\nThe development and use of AI must be transparent, accountable, and work in public interest. Deploying AI and automated decision-making, without adequate safeguards, checks and balances can facilitate human rights violations, exacerbate existing societal power imbalances, and create new risks, disproportionately affecting marginalized people and communities. We urge governments and companies to develop and enforce global AI governance frameworks that are binding, enforceable, and rooted in human rights law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy human rights must be at the core of AI governance\nCivil society has been consistently advocating for human rights-centric AI governance. But this effort is under threat from several angles; and with it, any chance of achieving a reality in which AI development serves people, instead of surveilling and exploiting them.\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPOTLIGHT: EU AI ACT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe EU AI Act: a failure for human rights, a victory for industry and law enforcement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nLoopholes and exemptions: the EU has voted to adopt an AI Act that fails to protect people from harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe EU AI Act proposal: a timeline\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nA summary of our proposed amendments to the draft EU AI Act and a timeline of our related commentary and recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe EU AI Act: How to (truly) protect people on the move\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe EU AI Act is supposed to protect the rights of everyone impacted by AI systems.
