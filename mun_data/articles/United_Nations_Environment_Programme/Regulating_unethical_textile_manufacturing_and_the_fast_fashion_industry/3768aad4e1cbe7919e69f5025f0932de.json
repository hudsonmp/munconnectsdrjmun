Figures are based on the sale of physical goods via a digital channel to a private end consumer. This definition encompasses purchases via desktop computers (including notebooks and laptops) as well as purchases via mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). The following are not included in the eCommerce market: digitally distributed services (see instead: eServices), digital media downloads or streams, digitally distributed goods in B2B markets, and the digital purchase or resale of used, defective, or repaired goods (reCommerce and C2C). All monetary figures refer to the annual gross revenue and do not factor in shipping costs. Modeling approach / Market size:Market sizes are determined by a combined top-down and bottom-up approach, based on a specific rationale for each market segment. As a basis for evaluating markets, we use annual financial reports of the market-leading companies and industry associations, third-party studies and reports, survey results from our primary research (e.g., Statista Global Consumer Survey), data on shopping behavior (e.g., Google Trends, Alibaba Trends), and performance factors (e.g., user penetration, price/product). Furthermore, we use relevant key market indicators and data from country-specific associations such as GDP, consumer spending, internet penetration, and population. This data helps us estimate the market size for each country individually. Forecasts:In our forecasts, we apply diverse forecasting techniques. The selection of forecasting techniques is based on the behavior of the particular market. For example, the S-curve function and exponential trend smoothing are well suited for forecasting digital products and services due to the non-linear growth of technology adoption. The main drivers are GDP per capita, consumer spending per capita, internet penetration, and population. Additional Notes:The market is updated twice per year in case market dynamics change. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is considered at a country-specific level.
