We educate and mobilise consumers, lobby companies and governments, and offer direct solidarity support to workers as they fight for their rights and demand better working conditions.\n\nClean Clothes Campaign brings together trade unions and NGOs covering a broad spectrum of perspectives and interests, such as women‚Äôs rights, consumer advocacy and poverty reduction.\n\nAs a grass-roots network of hundreds of organisations, both in garment-producing and in consumer markets, we can identify local problems and objectives and transform them into global actions. We develop campaign strategies to support workers in achieving their goals. We also cooperate extensively with similar labour rights campaigns.\n\n          \n\n\n\n          Website\n      \n\n\n      http://www.cleanclothes.org\n      \n\nExternal link for Clean Clothes Campaign\n\n\n\n\n          Industry\n      \n\n        \n                  Civic and Social Organizations\n                \n      \n\n\n\n          Company size\n      \n\n        \n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        11-50 employees\n  \n\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n          Type\n      \n\n        \n                  Nonprofit\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n          Specialties\n      \n\n        \n                  garment industry worker empowerment, labour rights, gender equality, campaining, and solidarity\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Locations\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Primary\n                  \n\n \n\n      Get directions\n      \n\n\n\n \n \n                          AMSTERDAM, NL\n                    \n\n\n      Get directions\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Employees at Clean Clothes Campaign\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Yolanda Weldring\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Nicolle Beeby-Amro\n\n\n\n\n              \n        Network Communication Coordinator at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Ton de Heij\n\n\n\n\n              \n        at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Noa »òerban-Temi»ôan\n\n\n\n\n              \n        International Urgent Appeals Coordinator at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n          See all employees\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Updates\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Clean Clothes Campaign\n            \n \n\n                39,571 followers\n            \n \n\n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      2h\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this post\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUS and globally active apparel brands should not resort to the same kneejerk reaction to adversity as during the pandemic.

and sportswear industries. \n\nSince 1989, CCC has worked to ensure that the fundamental rights of workers are respected. We educate and mobilise consumers, lobby companies and governments, and offer direct solidarity support to workers as they fight for their rights and demand better working conditions.\n\nClean Clothes Campaign brings together trade unions and NGOs covering a broad spectrum of perspectives and interests, such as women‚Äôs rights, consumer advocacy and poverty reduction.\n\nAs a grass-roots network of hundreds of organisations, both in garment-producing and in consumer markets, we can identify local problems and objectives and transform them into global actions. We develop campaign strategies to support workers in achieving their goals. We also cooperate extensively with similar labour rights campaigns.\n\n          \n\n\n\n          Website\n      \n\n\n      http://www.cleanclothes.org\n      \n\nExternal link for Clean Clothes Campaign\n\n\n\n\n          Industry\n      \n\n        \n                  Civic and Social Organizations\n                \n      \n\n\n\n          Company size\n      \n\n        \n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        11-50 employees\n  \n\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n          Type\n      \n\n        \n                  Nonprofit\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n          Specialties\n      \n\n        \n                  garment industry worker empowerment, labour rights, gender equality, campaining, and solidarity\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Locations\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Primary\n                  \n\n \n\n      Get directions\n      \n\n\n\n \n \n                          AMSTERDAM, NL\n                    \n\n\n      Get directions\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Employees at Clean Clothes Campaign\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Yolanda Weldring\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Nicolle Beeby-Amro\n\n\n\n\n              \n        Network Communication Coordinator at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Ton de Heij\n\n\n\n\n              \n        at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Noa »òerban-Temi»ôan\n\n\n\n\n              \n        International Urgent Appeals Coordinator at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n          See all employees\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Updates\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Clean Clothes Campaign\n            \n \n\n                39,571 followers\n            \n \n\n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      2h\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this post\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUS and globally active apparel brands should not resort to the same kneejerk reaction to adversity as during the pandemic.

We educate and mobilise consumers, lobby companies and governments, and offer direct solidarity support to workers as they fight for their rights and demand better working conditions.\n\nClean Clothes Campaign brings together trade unions and NGOs covering a broad spectrum of perspectives and interests, such as women‚Äôs rights, consumer advocacy and poverty reduction.\n\nAs a grass-roots network of hundreds of organisations, both in garment-producing and in consumer markets, we can identify local problems and objectives and transform them into global actions. We develop campaign strategies to support workers in achieving their goals. We also cooperate extensively with similar labour rights campaigns.\n\n          \n\n\n\n          Website\n      \n\n\n      http://www.cleanclothes.org\n      \n\nExternal link for Clean Clothes Campaign\n\n\n\n\n          Industry\n      \n\n        \n                  Civic and Social Organizations\n                \n      \n\n\n\n          Company size\n      \n\n        \n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        11-50 employees\n  \n\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n          Type\n      \n\n        \n                  Nonprofit\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n          Specialties\n      \n\n        \n                  garment industry worker empowerment, labour rights, gender equality, campaining, and solidarity\n                \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Locations\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n                    Primary\n                  \n\n \n\n      Get directions\n      \n\n\n\n \n \n                          AMSTERDAM, NL\n                    \n\n\n      Get directions\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Employees at Clean Clothes Campaign\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Yolanda Weldring\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Nicolle Beeby-Amro\n\n\n\n\n              \n        Network Communication Coordinator at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Ton de Heij\n\n\n\n\n              \n        at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n            \n        Noa »òerban-Temi»ôan\n\n\n\n\n              \n        International Urgent Appeals Coordinator at Clean Clothes Campaign\n      \n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n          See all employees\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            Updates\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n              Clean Clothes Campaign\n            \n \n\n                39,571 followers\n            \n \n\n                  \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n      2h\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Report this post\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUS and globally active apparel brands should not resort to the same kneejerk reaction to adversity as during the pandemic.
