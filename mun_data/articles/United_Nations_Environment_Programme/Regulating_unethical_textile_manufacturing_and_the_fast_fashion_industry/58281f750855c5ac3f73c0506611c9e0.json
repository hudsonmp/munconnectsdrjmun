  "text": "KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n \n\n\n\n\nTOTAL GLOBAL RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY WILL NEED TO\nTRIPLE BY 2030 to reach more than 11 000 GW under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario\nin the World Energy Transitions Outlook, with solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind\npower accounting for about 90% of renewable energy capacity additions.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS MUST DOUBLE BY 2030 TO REMAIN ON\nA 1.5°C PATHWAY. In IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario this will be driven by a combination\nof efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. These\nvital milestones must be achieved to keep the global energy transition on track\nto meet Paris Agreement goals.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF POLICIES IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THESE\nAMBITIOUS TARGETS. Aside from deployment and enabling policies, structural\nchange is needed to ensure the transition to an energy-efficient economy and a\nrenewables-based power system is just and fair, and provides benefits for all.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES ENABLING MEASURES THAT GO BEYOND\nREGULATIONS OR FISCAL AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. The organisational structures of power\nsectors must be reshaped to integrate a higher share of renewables. Procurement mechanisms\nmust be designed in a way that strengthens value chains and trade, and industrial policies must\nbe fit for building resilient supply chains. Education, training, re-skilling and up-skilling should\nbe prioritised; women and under-represented groups must be empowered; and collaboration\nbetween industry, civil society, policy makers and other key stakeholders should be encouraged.\n\nEXISTING ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE EXPANDED AND MODERNISED TO\nCREATE A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM FIT FOR RENEWABLES. There is an urgent need to boost crosssector infrastructure planning, increase cross-border co-operation and develop regional power\ngrids. Action is also needed to drive grid modernisation and expansion and ensure supply-side\nflexibility and demand-side management.\n\nRENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries.\n\nWE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. Annual average investment in renewable\npower generation must reach USD 1 300 billion by 2030, compared to 486 billion in 2022. In the\ndeveloping world, we must minimise investment risks and provide access to low-cost financing.\nThe global financial architecture must be reformed to support the energy transition in the Global\nSouth. Climate-related funding from multilateral development banks must be ramped up, and\npublic capital should be redirected from the fossil fuels sector to renewable energy.\n\nTHIS WILL REQUIRE STRONG INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. Immediate efforts are\nrequired to facilitate and contribute to multilateral initiatives that promote knowledge sharing\nand capacity building to deliver a just transition whilst also safeguarding nature and biodiversity.\nCollaboration is urgently required to foster collective action on governance, climate finance and\ninnovation. North-South and South-South dialogues should be cultivated; groups like the G7 and\nG20 must mobilise support and investment; and just transition funds should be established and\noperationalised in emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its\nlatest Assessment Report (AR6), sent a clear message to the world that this\ndecade is critical to our success in limiting global surface temperature increase\nto 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (IPCC, 2023).\nThere is an urgent need for rapid and immediate action to reduce global net\nanthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by almost 50% from 2019 levels\nby 2030, with a significant proportion of this reduction occurring within the field\nof energy.\n\nHowever, the energy transition remains off-track and global greenhouse gas\nemissions have reached record levels. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels.\nThis is far below the emission reductions required to place the world on a 1.5°C\npathway. The message is clear: we cannot limit global surface temperature\nincrease to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century without\nrapid, sustained and concerted action.\n\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake (GST), through which policy\nmakers, industry, financial institutions, civil society and other stakeholders will\nreflect on the progress achieved in implementing climate pledges since the\nadoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Leveraging low-cost solar PV, onshore and offshore wind, and\nother renewable electricity generation sources, the power sector must lead the way as solutions in other\nsectors scale up. Accelerating the progress of the transition worldwide requires a holistic approach,\nbacked by systemic innovation to transform existing structures and systems built for the fossil fuel era.\n\nWhilst the phase down of fossil fuels is both essential and inevitable, it must also be responsible. The\ntransition needs to be delivered in a way that ensures energy security, accessibility and affordability,\nwhile also sustaining socio-economic development and adopting nature-positive approaches. The\nspeed at which the transition is achieved will be determined by how quickly zero-carbon alternatives can\nbe introduced and scaled up.\n\nGreater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030.\nThese goals represent some of the most important levers for change to advance the energy transition\nthis decade.\n\nThis report consolidates high-level analysis of these targets, detailing existing shortfalls and identifying\nkey enablers to resolve them. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets.\n\nThe solutions presented are technologically mature, cost-competitive and commercially available, and can\nbe scaled up rapidly in most countries around the world; indeed, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind\nare already the most cost-competitive sources of new electricity supply in most countries today (IRENA,\n2023b). Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices.\nIt would also improve air quality and reduce health costs; deliver universal access to clean affordable\nenergy; and provide greater collective security and well-being. With the right policies in place, the global\nenergy transition will also bring extensive socio-economic benefits, including in the form of job creation\nand income generation.\n\nThe key enabling frameworks, policies and recommendations detailed in this report provide concrete\nadvice to governments around the world on the necessary steps required between now and 2030 to meet\nthese targets. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIt is essential that global leaders convening at COP28 demonstrate the collective will to set a new pace for\naction this decade by committing to these targets; in short, this is a critical step in a critical decade to keep\nthe 1.5°C target within reach. This will require accelerated actions in many areas, in particular modernising\nand expanding physical energy infrastructure; improving power system operations; establishing the\nright policies and regulatory frameworks; building resilient supply chains; and developing skills and\ninstitutional capacities. These actions must be underpinned by a significant increase in public and private\nfinancing, particularly to support the developing world.\n\nTo ensure the energy transition is both just and inclusive, greater international\ncollaboration is also needed. Worldwide, around 675 million people still lack access\nto electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking methods (IEA et al., 2023).\nProviding renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nForewords\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sultan Al Jaber\n            COP28 President-Designate\nTripling the deployment of renewable power generation and doubling\n            energy efficiency are amongst the most important levers to cut greenhouse\n            gas emissions.\nThe world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow.\nThe Global Stocktake has told us exactly how far off track we are. We need\n            to cut 22 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases in the next 7 years in order to\n            keep 1.5°C within reach.\nThe phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable and essential, but it must be\n            responsible. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy. Now is the time to turbocharge solutions and meet the\n            urgency of the moment with ambitious and determined action.\nAhead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in\n            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and\n            double energy efficiency.\nThis report outlines actionable solutions that can enable the progress we\n            need and demonstrates that this target is ambitious but achievable.\nI am now calling on everyone to come together, commit to common targets,\n            and take comprehensive domestic and international action, as outlined in\n            this report, to make our ambitions a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco La Camera\n            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency\nOur mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,\n            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency\n            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the\n            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is\n            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action.\nA significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with\n            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is\n            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris\n            Agreement. This will require concerted action to urgently address deeply\n            entrenched systemic barriers across infrastructure, policy and institutional\n            capacities stemming from systems and structures created for the fossil\u0002-fuel era.\nWe must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing\n            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;\n            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted\n            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and\n            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and\n            capabilities match the energy system of the future. This is especially\n            important for developing countries, where we must deliver on our\n            commitments to sustainable development, ensuring no one is left behind.\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake, in which the world\n            reflects on its progress in implementing the Paris Agreement. It is vital that\n            collective action be galvanised following this key milestone in our journey\n            toward a climate-safe existence to ensure the forthcoming round of\n            Nationally Determined Contributions in 2025 represents a transformative\n            leap forward, realigning us with the 1.5°C goal. This report outlines the\n            essential actions governments must prioritise to achieve this objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Douglas\n            Chief Executive Officer, Global Renewables Alliance\nThis is the ‘make or break’ decade to avoid the most catastrophic impacts\n            of climate change. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future.\n            \nDouble down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This\n            would deliver cleaner electricity systems, access to affordable energy and\n            green jobs for millions of people, billions of dollars in public and private\n            capital to foster climate-resilient growth, and reduce loss and damage for\n            nature and people wrought by harmful climate change.\n            \nTo achieve these targets, we need to dramatically ramp up wind power,\n            solar power, hydropower and geothermal power. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. On average, 1 000 GW\n            of renewables needs to be installed each year for the rest of the decade to\n            bring total renewables capacity to 11 000 GW by 2030. As the growth curve\n            will rise over the course of the decade, the renewables industry believes\n            at least 1 500 GW of renewables capacity could be installed in 2030 alone.\n            \nGlobal leaders must commit to these targets at COP28. However, progress\n            towards 2030 goals cannot be taken for granted. Policy makers must\n            work hand-in-hand with industry and civil society to urgently implement\n            the enabling actions in this report, centred on: infrastructure and system\n            operation; policy and regulation; and supply chains, skills and capacities.\n            Critically, these areas must be reinforced by low-cost financing and\n            international collaboration.\n            \nThis is a unique “once in a generation” opportunity, but we need urgent\n            action to scale renewable energy in every region of the world. Only then\n            can we protect the planet and secure a liveable future for all.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPreface\r\n \n\n\n\n\nSince the Rio Earth Summit and the adoption of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, the\nConference of the Parties to the Convention (COP) has convened\nsignatory Parties each year to determine ambitions and responsibilities,\nand identify and assess the progress of climate measures. The 21st\nsession of the COP (COP21) led to the Paris Agreement, which mobilised\ncollective action to limit the increase in global average temperature\nto well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, pursue efforts to limit\nthe temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and\nstrengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.\n\nCOP28, and the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement, can\nbe the turning point on climate action over this critical decade to\naccelerate a transition that puts economies on the path toward a new\nlow-carbon, high-growth, sustainable economic model in a way that\nis both transformational and just. COP28 has the vision to deliver on\nthe pillars of the Paris Agreement, focusing on specific action on four\nparadigm shifts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nfast-tracking the energy transition and slashing emissions before 2030;\ntransforming climate finance, by delivering on old promises and\n    setting the framework for a new deal on finance;\nputting nature, people, lives and livelihoods at the heart of climate\n    action; and\nmobilising for the most inclusive COP ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nDisclaimer and acknowledgements\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThis publication and the material herein are provided “as is”.

According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario identifies a technically and economically feasible pathway to an energy future that\nis consistent with Paris Agreement goals. It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system.\n\nDespite the progress achieved to date, the current deployment of energy transition technologies is\ninsufficient in speed and scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions.\n\nBy 2030, global total installed renewable power generation capacity would need to expand more than\nthree-fold, from 3 382 GW in 2022 to 11 174 GW, according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Specifically,\ninstalled solar PV capacity would rise to more than 5 400 GW, from 1 055 GW in 2022, and wind installations\nwould surpass 3 500 GW (3 040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore), up from 899 GW in 2022, over the\nsame period (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c). The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. After solar PV and\nwind power, the third-largest increase in generation capacity would be in hydropower; by 2030, global\ninstalled hydropower capacity (excluding pumped hydro) would grow by almost 17% from the 2022 level,\nreaching 1 465 GW under the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario.\n\n\nFIGURE 1 Key performance indicators for achieving the 1.5°C Scenario in the Decade for Action\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c).\n\n\nThis suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Energy storage capacity would expand in tandem, with\ncumulative global battery storage increasing by a factor of 21, from 17 GW in 2020 to 359 GW in 2030\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRenewable power additions this decade may not be linear, however, with many factors impacting the\nrate of growth. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Some projections of solar growth foresee that 1 000 GW of annual solar PV installations\nalone may be reached as soon as 2028 (Haegel et al., 2023). To meet the tripling renewable power target,\nannual renewable additions need to ramp up as fast as possible, and as early as possible, in this decade.\n\nCountries and regions will follow different trajectories in accelerating the deployment of renewable\npower capacity. Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. This will allow them to assist others by sharing\nlessons learnt, technological and technical know-how, and experiences in establishing the right\nconditions for the scaling up of renewables.\n\nUnder the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario, the global solar PV market would be dominated by G20 countries; but\noutside this group, cumulative capacity will need to surpass 900 GW by 2030, while the cumulative capacity\nin G20 countries would reach approximately 4 530 GW. For wind, China, the United States, Canada, Brazil\nand several European countries have high onshore wind potential, while the majority of expansions in\noffshore wind would be in four key markets (China, EU-27, the United States and India), accounting for\nmore than 60% of offshore wind deployment by 2030. For hydropower, G20 countries together would\naccount for 79% (over 1 150 GW) of global hydropower capacity by 2030, with almost 305 GW of total\ncapacity spread across the rest of the world.\n\nFIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. Bioenergy includes biogas, biomass\nwaste and biomass solid.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nIt is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022).\n\nAccelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nIn 2010, the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of onshore wind was\nUSD 0.107/kilowatt hour (kWh) – 95% higher than the lowest fossil fuel cost of USD 0.056/kWh. Yet,\nby 2022, the global weighted average LCOE of new onshore wind projects was USD 0.033/kWh – 52%\nlower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option, at USD 0.069/kWh (Figure 3).\n\nThis improvement was surpassed by that of solar PV, however. In 2010, solar PV had a global weighted\naverage LCOE of USD 0.445/kWh – 710% more expensive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option; but\nby 2022, a spectacular decline in costs – to USD 0.049/kWh – made solar PV’s global weighted average\nLCOE 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nFIGURE 3 Cost competitiveness of solar and wind power, 2010-2022\n\nNote: LCOE = levelised cost of electricity.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nThe global weighted-average LCOE of offshore wind fell from being 258% more expensive than the cheapest\nfossil fuel option in 2010 to being just 17% more expensive in 2022, with costs falling from USD 0.197/kWh\nto USD 0.081/kWh. Concentrated solar power (CSP) saw its global weighted average LCOE fall from 591%\nhigher than the cheapest fossil fuel option in 2010 to 71% higher in 2022 (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nWhile hydropower’s global weighted average LCOE increased in 2021-2022 to USD 0.061/kWh – largely\nowing to the development of more challenging and remote sites – it remains cheaper than new\nfossil-fuel fired options. This is also true for geothermal projects, with a global weighted-average LCOE\nof USD 0.056/kWh in 2022, as well as for bioenergy projects, at USD 0.061/kWh (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nIt is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. 2 As 2022\nshowed, the indirect economic benefits of this enhanced energy security can be significant; yet they are\ntypically not valued in current policy.\n\nFIGURE 4 Investments required to meet the 1.5°C goal\n\nSource: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nSimilarly, the economic benefits of reducing pollution, and thereby improving climate, environmental and\nhealth outcomes, are almost never properly valued in policy-setting (IRENA, 2023b). These unpriced\nbenefits significantly improve the competitiveness of renewable power and make the business case for\naccelerated deployment even more compelling.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. This represents a transformative shift in power system\nsupply dynamics and poses new challenges to power system operations. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies.\n\nIn recent years, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity – known as ‘green hydrogen’ – and its\nderivatives have been identified as industrial feedstocks for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors.\nHydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. These measures can often generate\neconomic and environmental co-benefits. A range of measures will be needed across all end-use sectors,\nincluding modal shifts from private passenger cars to collective transport, and from passenger aviation\nand road-based freight to rail, as well as the adoption of circular economy principles, improved building\ninsulation, heat pumps and efficient electric motors – especially for industrial end-use sectors.\n\nEnergy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification.\nThe electrification of end-use sectors – such as in transport and buildings – would see a rise in direct use\nof electricity in total final energy consumption from 22% in 2020 to 29% in 2030.\n\nTechnical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nTo align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). If this rate is achieved, global final energy consumption would experience\nminimal growth over the same period.\n\nWith renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made.\n\nFIGURE 5 Energy intensity: Indicators in transport and buildings in 2030\n Based on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants.\nThis will require enhancements to – and expansion of – current power\ngrid systems, and the modernisation and upgrading of power system\noperations.\n\nWith VRE sources becoming the major source of power in a\n1.5°C-compatible world, countries must start upgrading and\nexpanding their power grid infrastructure to prepare for increasing\nend-use sector electrification. Multiple measures are required,\nincluding:\n\n\nInnovative power planning, grid expansion, modernisation and\n    enhancement, and addressing interconnection backlogs (projects\n    awaiting connection to the grid).\n    \nChanges in grid operation and management, potentially also\n    including new market design.\n    \nIncreased interconnectors between countries and regions.\n    \nGrowth in electricity storage; comprising short-duration storage\n    for increasing grid flexibility and long-duration storage to enhance\n    energy security (e.g. pumped storage).\n    \nMeasures to allow greater integration of demand-side management\n    and behind-the-meter (consumer) flexibility options (e.g. distributed\n    storage).\n    \nIntroducing other flexibility sources (e.g. green hydrogen, hybrid\n    renewable parks combining wind/solar/storage, etc.).\n    \n\n\nFIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). 4  With clarity on grid infrastructure development\nplans and reasonable guarantees on connection availability, investors will feel more confident building\nnew generation; meanwhile, consumers would be more likely to invest in electrification when a reliable\nsupply of low-cost electricity can be made available.\n\nWhen integrating higher shares of locally available variable solar and wind power, power systems will\nalso need to innovate to become: increasingly decentralised, allowing electricity to be generated at\nlocations closer to demand; and bi-directional, allowing electricity from distributed power generating\nfacilities to be injected into the grid.\n\nModernised, smarter grids are required; in the European Union (EU), around 30% of the envisaged\ninvestment in grids by 2030 could be earmarked for digitalisation 5  (European Commission, 2022).\nThey will also need to be larger and more robust. Hence, grid costs are expected to increase over time\n(IRENA, 2023a). This will require fast-tracked permitting to ensure timely investments in modern grids.\nAdding more widely distributed power generation sources will also bring resilience, especially against\nincreasingly intense extreme weather events owing to climate change (IPCC, 2023).\n\nThe electrification of transport also requires significant investments in enabling infrastructure. Electric\nvehicles will potentially account for more than 80% of all road transport activity by 2050; with 359 million\nelectric and plug-in hybrid light passenger vehicles worldwide by 2030 and 2 182 million by 2050 (IRENA,\n2023a); yet their market entry will be contingent upon coordinated investments in charging infrastructure\nand power grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure planning, timelines and assessments of investment needs for grids are aligned with long-term targets for renewable energy buildout and end-use sector decarbonisation, e.g. transport.\nMobilise funds for long-term grid investment; channel donor finance to building capacity and\n    infrastructure for integrating renewables; and streamline permitting procedures for new grid\n    infrastructure and upgrades to existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.\nDevelop modernised, decentralised (where suitable) and more resilient grid systems using\n    digitalisation, smart applications for demand-side management and interconnections with\n    neighbouring grid systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur.\nHistorically, this has been provided by pumped storage and hydropower with reservoirs.\nHowever, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). All of these technologies are undergoing rapid\ninnovation.\n\nFIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. saving energy from spring days with low loads and abundant solar to deploy\nduring high load days in the summer; or from windy autumn days to deploy during high load cloudy winter\ndays). Diverse storage technologies enhance the resilience of grids that are subject to extreme weather\nfor prolonged periods, help relieve grid congestion, provide transmission services and shore up local\narea reliability.\n\nLDES, including storage technologies spanning 10+, 24+, 100+ and 150+ hours in duration and providing\nboth power and heat, is also able to provide other grid services including black start (restarting parts\nof the grid where power has been lost in a blackout) and micro-grid level assistance for areas or key\ninfrastructure that may lose power. Storage durations can span weeks or months in the case of pumped\nstorage and reservoir hydropower. As the largest form of installed flexibility at over 175 GW worldwide,\npumped storage hydropower can play an important role in providing LDES and vital grid services, with\nsubstantial potential for off-river pumped storage to be developed in the coming decades (IHA, 2023).\nSome LDES technologies are commercially available today, while others are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Numerous companies are signing contracts (e.g. with utilities, airports, data centres,\nindustrial users, etc.) and are deploying LDES at grid-scale quantities, and pumped storage has been\nsuccessfully deployed for decades.\n\nOne emerging LDES technology is hydrogen storage. Hydrogen’s true competitive strength lies in its\nunique ability to store energy for long periods of time in large quantities. As green hydrogen displaces\nfossil fuels in some end uses, hydrogen storage could become increasingly critical to energy security,\nin the same way that natural gas storage is today in many regions. Hydrogen storage will be needed\nprimarily to meet variation in supply (rather than demand), as green hydrogen is created using VRE\nsources. Long-term hydrogen storage can play an important role in strengthening energy security and\nsystem resilience (IRENA, 2023d). Support for the continued development of these technologies is\ncritical for decarbonisation.\n\nIn many places, however, legacy market arrangements and policy frameworks do not incentivise\ninvestment in storage at scale. Action from policy makers can drive progress in this sector, such as:\nassessing energy storage and flexibility needs; setting LDES mandates for medium- and long-term\ncapacity targets; updating criteria for marketplaces; providing innovation grants and subsidies for prefeasibility studies; and establishing public-private partnerships.\n\nOther market innovations can also foster a healthy storage market, such as the introduction of congestion\nmanagement trading platforms, ancillary services markets to support the grid, and awarding additional\nvalue for features such as flexibility in capacity payments and capability to provide peaking power\n(e.g. storage technologies that can replace a natural gas peaking plant should be reflected in system\nmodelling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConduct technical assessments of system decarbonisation needs and timelines, and ensure the\n    planned buildout of renewables is complemented by storage resources of varying duration, as\n    well as other sources of flexibility.\nCollaborate with regulators and the renewables sector to enhance power market planning and\n    ensure price signals, clear targets and procurement incentivise longer duration storage.\nEncourage investment and innovation in diverse storage technologies to suit different users, such\n    as by establishing research, development and innovation (RDI) grant programmes, encouraging\n    public–private partnerships and setting medium- and long-term capacity targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-use electrification and sector coupling\nWith solar and wind power scaling up rapidly in this decade, electrification has become a vital\ndecarbonisation pathway. Green hydrogen and its derivatives, produced by electrolysers using low-cost\nrenewable power, can be used to decarbonise end-use sectors that are difficult to electrify directly –\nsuch as iron and steel making, and shipping – and to provide seasonal energy storage solutions.\n\nHowever, electrification needs to be accelerated by systemic innovation, making it not only faster but\nsmarter. Smart electrification – through sector coupling and enhanced flexibility – prevents a higher peak\nelectricity load on the power system. It also enables the power system to accommodate new loads while\nallowing integration of a higher share of variable renewable electricity in a cost-efficient manner. This\ncan help sustain renewables-based electrification without jeopardising energy system operation, thus\nmaking the power system robust and resilient. To harness all these benefits, systemic innovation should\ninvolve the entire energy value chain across four key dimensions: technology and infrastructure; market\ndesign and regulation; system planning and operation; and business models (IRENA, 2023d). Smart\ncharging for electric vehicles is a good example in this regard.\n\nSector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nThe benefit of this will be smarter, more intelligent demand-side management, achieved by deploying\nmore advanced digital technologies both behind-the-meter (by energy consumers) and in power\nsystems. Demand response would become more agile and inter-operational through sector-coupled\ntechnologies such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to smart charging\nfacilities. This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nEnd-use electrification, sector-coupling and the rapid scale-up of variable renewable electricity all\nrequire integrated cross-sectoral infrastructure planning – a process for optimising the co-development\nof increasingly connected infrastructure in various sectors. 7 The European Hotmaps project offers an\nopen-source toolbox to support public authorities, energy agencies and urban planners as they plan\nheating and cooling at local, regional and national levels. It allows users to map cooling and heating\ndemand, as well as supply, in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom, and provides renewable\nenergy generation and industrial waste heat potentials (Hotmaps, 2021). This facilitates the integration\nof heating and cooling with waste-to-energy and renewable energy, including power-to-heat. However,\nthis planning approach requires incentives for infrastructure investments where market barriers exist,\ngiven that different infrastructures operate under different legislative, regulatory and policy regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt a sector-coupling approach to the decarbonisation of economies by pursuing smart\n    electrification of the transport, buildings and industry sectors.\nCreate fora for co-ordinated planning among relevant authorities on infrastructure development,\n    including renewable energy projects, grid and transmission assets, electric vehicle charging\n    infrastructure and heat networks.\nIntroduce economic incentives for smart electrification and demand-side response (such as tax\n    credits and innovation grants) to encourage private investment in sector-coupling solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand-side management\nElectricity systems are complex; in addition to the grid infrastructure planning required to unlock the\nbenefits of sector coupling, distributed grid planning and operations will need well-defined energy\nmanagement schemes on both sides of the end-user meter. These schemes apply to both the supply side\n(power management) and demand side (load management).\nDemand-side management (DSM) comprises a set of strategies traditionally aimed at reducing peak\ndemand, which will be increasingly needed to incentivise consumption in periods of high VRE generation.\nDSM addresses various challenges, including VRE integration, rising electricity costs and environmental\nimpacts. For example, DSM can employ time-of-use pricing to encourage customers to shift electricity\nusage to off-peak hours, while demand response programmes can financially reward customers for\nreducing electricity usage during peak hours or consuming electricity during high VRE generation\nperiods. Critical-peak pricing, real-time pricing and critical-peak rebates are also among the strategies\navailable. These approaches are crucial for optimising energy efficiency in both residential and industrial\nbuildings.\nAs the transition advances, DSM will also provide flexibility to alleviate the need for more costly\nrequirements. Several challenges persist, however – particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, and other Global South regions. Notable issues include physical grid and digital technology\ninfrastructure gaps, as well as complex and inconsistent regulations and policies. Financing challenges\nalso hinder progress; attracting investment in clean energy enablers like DSM solutions requires\ninnovative financing models and incentives.\nIntelligent load control, demand response and energy efficiency are pivotal in enabling a secure and\nresilient renewables-based power system. Continued investment and innovation in these areas will\nfurther drive the adaptation of demand to supply in a renewable energy-driven future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAssess the cost-benefit of investment in DSM programmes, accounting for the energy and cost\n    savings it can provide instead of investing in grid infrastructure expansion.\nEnsure grid planning prioritises modernisation and DSM technology to close critical technology\n    gaps as infrastructure expands. Developing economies can explore innovative financing models –\n    such as blended finance – to mobilise investment in grid and DSM solutions.\nImprove data availability within the wider electricity system to enable innovation in DSM and\n    access to applications like smart meters by consumers and third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nGovernments have a crucial role to play in tripling renewable power capacity and placing the world on a\n1.5°C pathway. All too often, the energy transition discourse relegates governments’ responsibilities to\ncreating an enabling environment for private investments through predictable and stable policies, and\nthe creation of instruments that de-risk investment projects. Although this is crucial, a much broader and\nmore integrated policy approach is required to facilitate the adoption of an entire spectrum of energy\ntransition solutions needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and unlock its socio-economic benefits (Figure 8).\n\nGovernments need to be far more engaged in shaping and guiding the energy transition, including through\npolicies for ambitious public investment programmes and sufficient forward-planning for renewables\nscale-up, system integration and grid build-out.\n\nCross-cutting approaches covering all renewable technologies, electrification technologies and others\nare needed to facilitate the energy transition (e.g. energy storage), include enabling policies that set\nambitions and send clear signals to stakeholders, eliminate distortions, incentivise the uptake of solutions\nand facilitate access to affordable financing. They also include policies that ensure the integration of\nrenewables within energy systems, economies, nature and societies, as well as specific deployment\npolicies for various technologies. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand.\n\nTransitioning to a renewables-based economy may also bring challenges in the form of financing gaps,\nlabour market disruptions and energy sector insecurity. These misalignments, if not well-managed,\nrisk inequitable outcomes and a slower pace of the energy transition. Therefore, a set of structural and\njust transition policies, along with the creation of strong institutions to ensure policy co-ordination and\ncohesion, is required to manage potential misalignments.\n\nFinally, a holistic global policy framework that entails international collaboration including North-South\nand South-South co-operation is needed to bring stakeholders from countries around the world together\nto commit to a just transition that leaves no one behind and strengthens international finance flows,\ncapacities and technologies in an equitable manner.\n\nThis section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nFIGURE 8 The IRENA holistic policy framework for a just and inclusive energy transition\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2021b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Enhanced energy efficiency is a crucial enabler for making high\nlevels of end-use electrification feasible and affordable. Measures related to reducing energy demand\nand improving efficiency are needed across all end-use sectors.\n\nMinimum energy performance standards (MEPS) can support industrial, commercial and residential\nusers to procure and switch to more energy efficient appliances or equipment such as electric heating/\ncooling technologies. Building codes can set energy performance requirements by specifying insulation\nstandards, thereby reducing heating and cooling demands. They can also specify greenhouse gas\nemission targets and carbon footprints. For renovation, in particular, codes can be coupled with financial\nincentives.\n\nIt is also important to address prevailing challenges associated with building ownership structures,\nequitable access and benefit-sharing of energy efficiency investments and policies. “Green loans” could\ncarry lower interest rates and protect low-income energy consumers from energy price fluctuations\nand inflationary environments. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.\n\nIn the transport sector, significant improvements can be achieved by promoting energy efficient mobility\n(e.g. public transport such as railways, metros and buses, and car-sharing), as well as active (nonmotorised) transport such as cycling and walking in urban areas. Public campaigns can be undertaken by\nnational and local governments to encourage green mobility modes. Other policies, such as differentiated\nparking fees and highway tolls, can encourage a shift to public transport, complemented by dedicated\ndriving lanes for car-sharing. Public transportation fleets also offer the opportunity to utilise costcompetitive renewable fuels or electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement with specific time horizons and outline\n    clear avenues for implementation.\n    \nStrengthen regulatory frameworks, including building codes that specify low energy performance\n    and appliance energy efficiency standards.\n    \nExpand the availability of financial incentives and affordable lending schemes for meeting\n    standards on energy efficiency, such as tax credits or green loans with favourable interest rates\n    for building renovation or modernisation.\n    \nEstablish public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy efficiency measures, public\n    transport and green mobility for cost savings and collective decarbonisation goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket incentives and fiscal policy\nWhile renewables have become increasingly competitive, they still face barriers compared to fossil fuels.\nRising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective. The choice of instrument and its design should consider: the nature of the solution\n(e.g. utility-scale, distributed, off-grid); level of development of the sector; power system organisational\nstructure; wider macroeconomic environment (e.g. impact of inflation and commodity price volatility);\nand broader policy objectives. It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below). This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk. A mechanism to allow for bilateral power\nprocurement between generators and private off-takers (such as industrial actors or corporates) can\nfurther strengthen the case for large deployment volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments.\n    \nIntroduce tax credits, levies and/or exemptions on import/export duties for key materials and\n    components in the renewable energy supply chain.\n    \nEnsure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains.\n    \nConsider the trade-offs between ‘lowest-price’ objectives, and other policy outcomes such as\n    socio-economic development, system integration and industry sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower market design and regulation\nThe world is entering a new era in which electricity systems will be increasingly dominated by zeromarginal-cost renewable technologies. Power markets must evolve and adapt to new market forces,\nsuch as corporate and industrial demand, and behind-the-meter (prosumer) generation. They must be\norganised in a way that incentivises new investment in renewable power generation and the flexibility to\nprovide reliable electricity at a level required for the 1.5°C pathway. This requires governments and other\nstakeholders to undertake a close examination of their power systems’ organisational structures, i.e. the\ninstitutions, processes and arrangements through which electricity services are exchanged and rewarded.\n\nWholesale power markets today are based on marginal cost pricing, where the most expensive\ngenerator (with the highest variable cost – typically fossil fuel-fired plants) determines electricity\nprices for the time period in which the market operates. This poses a number of challenges. As the\nshare of renewable power grows, wholesale spot markets will see increased price volatility, as periods\nof high renewable power generation push clearing prices in the wholesale market close to zero. When\nrenewable generation is less than demand, flexibility resources will be needed, potentially resulting in\nvery high prices at certain times.\n\nIf wholesale markets are the main source of revenue, the economic feasibility of new investments will\nplummet, as even existing generators will struggle to recover their initial capital costs whilst prospective\ninvestors realise diminishing returns. The paradigm that relies on free markets to incentivise power\nsupply investment decisions therefore needs to change.\n\nUltimately, a renewables-based power system requires enhanced flexibility; wholesale market design\nmust deliver this as well as providing the volume of renewable power needed. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.\n\nPower system organisational structures must evolve to better align with energy policy and\ndecarbonisation goals. A “dual procurement” power market design could introduce long-term\ncontract mechanisms (e.g. Auctions, CfDs, PPAs) as the backbone of renewable power procurement,\nalongside a short-term market to dispatch flexible resources in an affordable way (IRENA, 2022a).\nThis holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system.\n\nThis transformation is partially underway, as auctions are becoming the preferred tool to procure\nrenewable energy, and wholesale markets are becoming more time and location granular (IRENA,\n2023a); but there are meaningful actions authorities can take now to ensure the acceleration of this trend.\n\nOne way to achieve enhanced system flexibility is for power markets to allow flexibility technologies\n(such as batteries and pumped hydropower) to provide ancillary services and be rewarded accordingly.\nAncillary services that serve to stabilise the grid network and will become increasingly important as\ndispatchable fossil fuel-based generation is phased out of the power mix. Today, many power systems\nreward the provision of energy but not ancillary services (where these services are not included in\ncontractual obligations). They therefore need to be appropriately valued and reflected in power system\ndesign. Valuing, pricing and procuring ancillary services astutely can bring new players to the grid, with\nadvantages for the whole power system. Examples of this include the enhanced frequency regulation\nauctions in the UK.\n\nTo achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This includes growth in distributed renewable energy\ngeneration systems – notably using solar PV – but also community solar and wind projects. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. Such measures can maximise the socio-economic benefits of renewable energy, insulate consumers from price volatility, create local supply\nchains and job opportunities, and enhance public perceptions of renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors.\nDesign auctions that balance competitive price discovery and long-term delivery of affordable\n    electricity. Auctions should also be run for sufficiently large and ambitious volumes, with\n    consistent, transparent tendering schedules to effectively foster competitive bidding.\nCreate a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix.\nRethink participation rules to allow new technologies to engage in the power market as flexibility\n    providers, including storage and demand side aggregators.\nEncourage investment in distributed renewable energy systems that allow consumers to become\n    “prosumers” by both using and producing clean electricity.\nReorganise power market structures to ensure policies for accelerating renewables deployment\n    account for system flexibility as well as sustainable returns to generators and investors.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamlining permitting\nThe time and cost constraints imposed by permitting procedures represent a major bottleneck\nimpacting the deployment of renewable energy projects in many countries. It is essential that permitting\nprocedures are fit-for-purpose and keep pace with renewable and climate targets, without compromising\nenvironmental and social impact standards. Experiences from the public and private sectors indicate\nthat best practices in permitting centre on four areas: administrative consolidation; digitalisation; policy\nsupport; and public engagement (European Commission, 2023).\n\nRenewable energy developers often need to consult numerous authorities at national, sub-national and\nsometimes village or prefecture level for the necessary permits to build a project. This process can be\nlengthy and extremely bureaucratic; for instance, the global average time required for permitting an\noffshore wind project is nine years. Onshore wind and utility-scale PV permitting processes can also\nbe long, although they are typically shorter than those for offshore wind. Similar obstacles exist for\nhydropower projects and smaller scale distributed projects for end consumers using renewable energy\ntechnologies like rooftop solar.\n\nCreating dedicated, centralised authorities is one way to streamline this process by ensuring developers\ncan refer to a single focal point. Countries like Denmark and the Philippines have already adopted a “one-stop shop” model to accelerate renewables deployment, but this model only works if it is adequately\nresourced. In addition, digitalised processes to submit and track applications would enable developments\nto progress more efficiently, while access to digitised local consenting and historical dispute records\nwould allow developers and authorities to screen sites that could be high-risk or unsuitable at an early\nstage (IRENA, 2023h).\n\nAn overarching best practice is the introduction of legislation mandating a maximum lead time for the\npermitting of renewable energy projects. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. Gaining social acceptance through\npublic engagement with relevant stakeholders is critical in the consenting and constructing stages of a\nrenewable energy project. This includes early and continuous consultation by authorities and developers\nwith local communities to communicate the benefits and considerations brought by a project to the area,\nas well as a transparent conflict resolution mechanism that sincerely addresses community concerns.\n\nComprehensive and efficient permitting frameworks represent a clear win-win, allowing renewable\nenergy development to expand this decade while cultivating acceptance with other interests in land and\nsea spaces. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023).\n\nRecent studies indicate that adopting best practices in permitting could cut consenting time for utility-scale wind and solar projects by more than half; for example, onshore wind farms could be permitted in\none year, offshore wind farms in 1.5 years and solar farms in as little as three months (ETC, 2023). This\nmakes permitting a high-impact enabler for the energy transition, where the necessary investment in\nresource, policy support and capacity will bring enormous value to countries in accelerating renewables\ngrowth and securing associated socio-economic and environmental benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023).\n\nThe energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. If not well managed, these\nmisalignments risk inequitable outcomes, which could sow doubt among policy makers and the\npublic concerning the advantages of the transition and lead to a fractured and unco-ordinated policy\nenvironment. Hence, there is a need for policies and measures that equitably distribute the benefits of\nthe energy transition and raise public awareness about these positive impacts.\n\nIn terms of jobs, sectoral misalignments may arise due to potential shifts in value and supply chains\nduring the energy transition. For instance, transitioning from fossil fuel power generation to solar energy\nmay shift the focus from fuel extraction to the semi-conductor industry. The impact on employment\ndepends on factors such as domestic production and labour productivity. Labour-market interventions\nencompass adequate employment services attuned to evolving circumstances and needs, along with\nmeasures to facilitate labour mobility (IRENA and ILO, 2023).\n\nCommunity benefit schemes span countries from Costa Rica to Mali and adopt a range of structures,\nfrom shared ownership of renewable assets to industry sponsorship of critical social and economic\ninfrastructure in host communities (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2020). Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions.\n\nAligning policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition will facilitate local\nvalue creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, and on a larger scale, ensure political\nand social stability as renewable energy expands.\n\nAs part of a sensitive and efficient permitting framework, renewable development must be well integrated\nwith the principles of sustainability, circular economy and reduced environmental impact – particularly\non land use and biodiversity. This also applies to enabling infrastructure, with grid expansion into remote\nand biodiverse areas requiring careful siting.\n\nAdopting sustainable end-of-life management policies, including waste management legislation, can\nhelp countries prepare for the anticipated volumes of equipment waste such as solar PV panels and\nbatteries. Research and development programmes across the energy and waste sectors, and industrial\nclusters, can help to further scale waste management infrastructure on a national or regional basis\n(IRENA and IEA, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition and foster local\n    value creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, with a special focus on the\n    inclusion of marginalised groups.\nAnticipate labour market disruptions and establish programmes that can address workforce\n    gaps, minimise labour misalignments, create opportunities for targeted recruitment and labour\n    mobility, such as relocation grants, and establish social protection programmes.\nMinimise adverse environmental impacts and encourage nature-positive approaches, for example\n    by incentivising the uptake of sustainability standards for new renewable energy assets – such as\n    the Hydropower Sustainability Standard – as part of procurement schemes.\nEnsure the impacts of mining activities and the use of relatively scarce components are mitigated\n    through provisions for circular economy (end-of-life management, recycling and reuse of materials).\nGather information on renewables’ waste production through regular monitoring of waste\n    produced by technology, the composition of waste streams, installed system performance and the\n    causes and frequency of system failures, in order to adopt waste minimisation legislation suitable\n    for the pace and scale of the transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\r\n \n\n\n\n\nBuilding resilient supply chains\nThe vulnerabilities of key energy industries to logistics bottlenecks, commodity price volatility, trade\nbarriers, and commodity and component import dependencies have become increasingly apparent in\nrecent years. Energy supply chains have become a priority agenda for policy makers, as demand and\ncompetition for critical raw materials, rare earth elements and production capacity become more acute.\n\nWithout well-functioning and cost-efficient industrial supply chains, the energy transition will not\nmaterialise. If not well managed, competition, security and scarcity challenges in renewable energy\nsupply chains could lead to a disorderly transition, characterised by slower rates of renewables\ndeployment at inflated costs. A mismatch between supply and demand for several critical minerals is\nalready evident, with particularly high levels observed for lithium – a key material required for the shortduration energy storage and electric transport sectors (IRENA, 2023e). Bottlenecks for key components\nin the wind industry – e.g. nacelles, blades and gearboxes – are set to emerge by the second half of this\ndecade in Asia and the Americas (GWEC, 2023). High concentration risk in the global renewables supply\nchain also raises the prospect of price or security of supply uncertainty in the future.\n\nRobust and resilient global supply chains are required to support a 1.5°C pathway. The mining and\nprocessing of critical materials including lithium, copper, nickel and other rare earth metals are\nconstrained within specific geographies, exposing these supply chains to geopolitical tensions and\nconcentration risks (IRENA, 2023e). Policy makers should work with the private sector to identify\nproduction gaps and supply chain weaknesses on a national and regional basis, and generate strategies\nto reinforce supply chain security.\n\nSocially responsible procurement is another key issue, where many critical materials and components\nrefined or manufactured in one country are imported by others for use in the renewables sector. It will\nbe vital to ensure supply chains – in the mining and processing segments in particular – are managed\nwith respect to fair trade, and high environmental, social governance (ESG) and sustainability standards.\nResilient supply chains are also key to sustaining the cost-value proposition of renewable energy around\nthe world.\n\nAs countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. The need for local value creation and regional supply chain\ninvestment must be carefully balanced with reducing trade barriers for goods and services central to\nthe renewables renewables industry. This will be key to avoid intensifying supply chain bottlenecks\nand making renewables less cost-competitive, while maximising socio-economic benefits.\n\nMultilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. This will require governments to work with industry, civil society and other stakeholders to\nensure supply chain planning is conducted through a wider lens that encompasses national interests,\ncost-effective and socially responsible sourcing, long-term social and environmental sustainability, and\nclimate and renewable energy targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate with the renewables industry on industrial development reviews and plans for the\n    transition that are sustainable, achievable, and adequately mitigate risk of supply insecurity\n    and price volatility. Approaches include diversifying sources of production, anticipating critical\n    production gaps and localising value chains.\nEnsure socially responsible procurement of renewables by encouraging uptake of sustainable\n    supply chain assurance schemes, such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative.\nIncentivise public–private partnerships and investment in circularity to encourage reuse of\n    materials and a circular economy approach to project development, which can help to reduce\n    concentration risk and supply insecurity of critical materials.\nCo-operate with international fora and financial institutions to safeguard international trade\n    corridors for materials and components for key renewable energy technologies.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation, training and capacity-building\nBuilding a skilled energy transition workforce requires measures to both expand the talent pipeline and\nenhance the quality of education and training provisions.\n\nEarly exposure to renewable energy topics and careers is vital for sparking interest in pursuing a career in the\nsector, but also to increase social acceptance by a knowledgeable citizenry. The curricula at higher education\nand vocational training institutions must reflect the skills and competences required by the transition.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the content of education and training programmes, it is also important to\nenhance the instructional methods used. For example, experiential learning methods where students are\nencouraged to develop problem-solving strategies can help to prepare learners for jobs in the constantly\nevolving renewable energy sector, where independent knowledge-seeking will often be necessary.\n\nFacilitating collaboration between government agencies on workforce development, industry and\neducational institutions will contribute to more co-ordinated skill-matching efforts. It is vital to consider\nhow a just transition can respond to potential labour displacement in the existing energy sector workforce\nand re-skill or upskill appropriately.\n\nTargeted measures to train, recruit and retain women and other underrepresented or marginalised groups\n(including older workers, ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities and those on a low\nincome) will ensure the dividends of the transition are enjoyed by all. This inclusion can be implemented\nthrough early exposure to renewable energy leadership and career pathways, targeted scholarships,\ngovernment-funded training opportunities, and industry apprenticeship and mentorship schemes.\n\nOutside the renewables industry, it is equally important to ensure sufficiently skilled and trained workers\nare available in government departments concerned with international trade, supply chains, electric\ncharging infrastructure and land use. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government.\n\nCarefully designed public-private partnerships (PPPs) can also play a crucial role in improving overall\ntraining quality while meeting sectoral labour requirements, promoting national skill standards and\nmatchmaking communities with workplace training opportunities. In addition to improving training\ncontent, PPPs can also play a role in shifting the financing of training provisions to a more integrated\napproach that incorporates multiple funding mechanisms including payroll-based training levies, tax\nincentives, scholarships and donations, vouchers and student loans (Dunbar, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign workforce planning among all stakeholders, including labour agencies, labour unions, the\n    wider energy industry and educational institutions, to identify critical skill gaps and workforce\n    needs in advance, and to design skill-building strategies accordingly.\nProvide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition.\nEnsure energy transition goals are reflected in educational programmes and resources, such\n    as university curricula, vocational training institutions, occupational health and safety training\n    institutions, and professional education programmes.\nBuild the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce.\nInvest in reskilling and upskilling measures for vulnerable communities and those in fossil fuel\n    industries to ensure the employment benefits of the transition are extended to a wide subset of\n    the population. Such measures need to be embedded in broader regional economic revitalisation\n    programmes and investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). However, investments remain focused on a few technologies and concentrated\nin a limited number of countries. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). This trend is reflected in renewable power\ncapacity additions, as all of Africa accounted for less than 2% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA,\n2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023).\n\nTo achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. It is equally important that investments to modernise power grids and enhance operational flexibility\nincrease from the annual average investment of USD 274 billion in 2022 to USD 605 billion by 2030. 10 \n\nThis presents a dual challenge: 1) how to scale existing investment flows in countries and technologies;\nand 2) how to ensure these investment flows reach countries that are currently underserved by the\nenergy transition. Efforts to address the much higher cost of capital faced by developing economies –\nas much as three to five times more than in most OECD countries – are also needed (IRENA, 2023f). A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects.\n\nRepurposing public capital from the fossil fuel sector, including both direct investments and financial\nsupport in the form of subsidies, can help accelerate progress towards unlocking the capital required.\nThis public money can then catalyse private capital flows, amplifying investment efforts towards the\nUSD 35 trillion required (for the energy transition as a whole) in the remainder of this decade.\n\nFor example, public financial flows to fossil fuels in the G20 countries alone reached USD 1.4 trillion in\n2022 – more than double 2019 levels. Moreover, G20 governments supported the global fossil fuel industry\nthrough international aid, export credit support and concessional financing (such as equity, grants, loans\nand loan guarantees) at an average of USD 50 billion per year from 2019 to 2021 (IISD, 2023).\n\nPublic funding is urgently needed for basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to\ndrive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as industry and transport,\nor synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investment is scarce. Without this, the gap in\ninvestment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen, to the detriment of\nbillions of people and the success of a just and inclusive global energy transition.\n\nA more comprehensive definition of risk around investing in energy assets is needed. A narrow focus on\nthe return risk to investors must expand to encompass environmental and social risks. This approach,\nwhich should be exercised through rigorous international benchmarks and protocols for investment,\ncan also help to shift funding from fossil fuel assets to the renewables sector. With limited public funds\navailable in the developing world, the international community must step up.\n\nPublic funds (domestic or through international collaboration) must flow through intermediaries\n(e.g. governments, development finance institutions and global funds such as the Green Climate Fund).\nSuch instruments should channel public funds towards policies that support structural change and a\njust transition. Furthermore, these instruments should be designed progressively to ensure economic\nbenefits are shared in an equitable way.\n\nFinally, public investments are needed for economic interventions to support a more equitable\ndistribution of benefits from large-scale renewables growth. National carbon pricing revenues,\nfor example, could be redirected to support clean, affordable electricity access for lower-income\nhouseholds on a progressive basis.\n\nIt is also important to actively engage the private sector, given that public financing alone will not be\nanywhere near sufficient to address the huge investment needs for the global energy transition. The public\nsector can play a catalysing role by providing a conducive and predictable enabling environment for the\nlong-term investment decisions made in the private sector. Also, governments can set the right conditions\nfor private sector actors to build and finance a viable pipeline of energy transition-oriented projects.\n\nFor example, blended finance structures would allow concessional public finance, and even philanthropic\ngrant-based finance, to improve the risk-return profile of an investment, so that private capital is\nattracted at lower cost and/or better terms (IRENA, 2023g). Banks can also pool loans to relatively\nsmall renewables projects into a securitised product aimed at impact-minded investors, including retail\ninvestors who otherwise have few avenues to earn returns while funding renewables deployment (GFMA\nand BCG, 2020). The resulting financial portfolio of projects would reduce the perceived risk associated\nwith its individual components. Such an approach would require a level of contract standardisation to\nenable the bundling of small projects (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nWhile there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. In addition to the measures described above, capital mobilisation schemes like green\nbonds for renewables, as well as international coalition-building to guide distribution of renewables\ninvestment between the Global North and Global South, will be crucial to ensure renewables can\nequitably scale this decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation).\n    \nPromote the adoption of a comprehensive definition of investment risk within public and private\n    institutions that encompasses environmental and social externalities, thereby aligning financial\n    decision-making with broader public and social goals.\n    \nCollaborate with public and private sector actors to develop innovative, context-specific financing\n    and business models that address renewable energy financing gaps in underinvested countries.\n    This involves utilising blended finance, green bonds, financial aggregation, and innovative risk\n    mitigation tools tailored to each country’s unique needs.\n    \nDirect the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access.\n    \nFor Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. A fractured and unaligned approach to renewables deployment will lead\nto missed opportunities for countries to accelerate growth and enjoy the benefits of clean electricity,\nparticularly in the Global South. Public and private stakeholders alike are responsible for enhancing\nparticipation in multilateral initiatives that can facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building to\ndeliver a just transition via a 1.5°C pathway.\n\nWith the lion’s share of renewables investment benefiting developed economies, it will be important to\nstrengthen North-South and South-South collaboration to maximise the social and economic benefits\nfrom clean industrialisation. Country blocs such as the G20 can be powerful coalitions to mobilise support\nand investment around the global renewable energy target and its key enablers.\n\nMobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables.\n\nAdvanced economies are better positioned to mobilise public financing, but global policy frameworks are\nnecessary to secure affordable funding to underpin the energy transition at the national level elsewhere. In\nemerging economies, just transition funds need to be established to support plant closures, communities\nin transition, repurposing/rehabilitation, and retraining and skilling, among other priorities. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. A high proportion of the public funding mobilised will need to\nbe grant-based, avoiding the danger of adding to already high debt burdens faced by many countries.\n\nInternational climate finance has a key role to play in providing the public financing necessary for a just and\nfair energy transition. Its function will vary depending on the context; fossil fuel-dependent communities\nand countries will require targeted efforts to unwind lock-ins to the fossil fuel economy and plan an\nalternative development trajectory based on renewable power generation and economic activities (CPR,\n2021). Countries where mitigation requirements consistent with climate targets go beyond their fair\nshare of the global mitigation burden will require support to trigger the needed collaborative framework,\nleapfrog to renewables-based energy systems and reap their share of the transition benefits.\n\nIt will be important to ensure definitions, standards, governance and investment protocols for the\nenergy transition are fairly aligned to effectively funnel capital to renewables development that meets\nhigh social and environmental standards. From green taxonomy to emissions reduction standards, the\nneed for common ground in the renewables and green hydrogen sectors will be increasingly helpful for\nmultinational investors, companies and civil society actors to navigate the transition.\n\nInternational collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. There are many areas for continued innovation and learning, from DSM\nto LDES to green hydrogen derivatives – all of which will have a positive impact on decarbonisation.\nPlatforms for knowledge-sharing and imparting lessons learnt, such as the IRENA Collaborative Frameworks or the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), are important vehicles to ensure ambition\ncan be transformed into effective action at country level. This is particularly important for those countries\nthat are most vulnerable to the severe impacts of climate change, and so face more significant challenges\nto protect communities without adequate support for adaptation measures (UNCTAD, 2022).\n\nFinally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy.\nThe ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). Scaling up grid planning will support a more economic and\nsustainable approach to the transition, enabling better system balancing and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. This requires public-private platforms that bring governments together with financial institutions, renewable energy\n    developers and supply chain actors, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.\n    \nEnsure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth.\nEncourage robust standards and investment protocols for the transition that can allocate capital\n    to high-impact solutions in the renewables sector. This includes strict emissions standards as part\n    of green taxonomies to guide a capital shift away from fossil fuels and accelerate the development\n    of a green hydrogen sector.\nParticipate in platforms for knowledge-sharing and exchange on renewable energy research,\n    innovation and best practices across policy areas including auction design and corporate\n    procurement. Technology exchange and harmonised standards can also build the resilience of\n    the global renewable energy supply chain by achieving cost efficiencies, supporting best-in-class\n    asset development and lowering barriers to market.\nIntensify co-operation with neighbouring governments and grid authorities on regional grid\n    planning and opportunities for building interconnections, cross-border power trading, regional\n    power pools and innovative approaches like meshed grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario in the World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 shows, global energy-related\nCO2 emissions will need to be reduced significantly by 2030 to keep the Paris Agreement climate target\nwithin reach. This reduction will require a step change in action on both the supply and demand sides\nacross the entire energy system.\nTotal global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. This will\nneed to be complemented by a phase-down in fossil fuel generation, physical infrastructure upgrades,\nmodernisation and expansion, as well as enhanced grid flexibility.\nOn the demand side, energy efficiency improvements will be key. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This will not only require technological solutions but also behavioural\nchanges, necessitating greater awareness and broad support from communities and individuals for the\nenergy transition.\nThe twin goals of tripling renewable power and doubling energy efficiency by the end of this decade\nare undoubtedly challenging; but they are achievable. Their realisation requires urgent action by all\nstakeholders – governments (national, regional and local), international organisations, industry,\nfinance institutions and energy end-users (from big industrial users to individual households). The\nsooner we act, the sooner we will unlock the net economic, environmental and socio-economic benefits\nof an energy transition pathway that is consistent with the Paris Agreement goals.\n\nThis report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. They also need to make sure that the energy transition fosters socio-economic\nbenefits and minimises adverse environmental impacts. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth. Enhanced international collaboration can help facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building, as well as mobilise additional funding.\nThe current pace of action falls far short of that required to meet the 1.5°C target. COP28 provides a\nclear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit\nto tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target. Now is\nthe time for an ambitious new pledge that safeguards the wellbeing of our planet and enables the\nequitable distribution of the benefits of the energy transition among all peoples, nations and regions\nof the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nReferences\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPR (2021), Managing a fair transition away from coal in India, Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi, www.cprindia.org/managing-fair-transition-away-coal-india\n\nDunbar, M.

In IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario this will be driven by a combination\nof efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. These\nvital milestones must be achieved to keep the global energy transition on track\nto meet Paris Agreement goals.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF POLICIES IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THESE\nAMBITIOUS TARGETS. Aside from deployment and enabling policies, structural\nchange is needed to ensure the transition to an energy-efficient economy and a\nrenewables-based power system is just and fair, and provides benefits for all.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES ENABLING MEASURES THAT GO BEYOND\nREGULATIONS OR FISCAL AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. The organisational structures of power\nsectors must be reshaped to integrate a higher share of renewables. Procurement mechanisms\nmust be designed in a way that strengthens value chains and trade, and industrial policies must\nbe fit for building resilient supply chains. Education, training, re-skilling and up-skilling should\nbe prioritised; women and under-represented groups must be empowered; and collaboration\nbetween industry, civil society, policy makers and other key stakeholders should be encouraged.\n\nEXISTING ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE EXPANDED AND MODERNISED TO\nCREATE A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM FIT FOR RENEWABLES. There is an urgent need to boost crosssector infrastructure planning, increase cross-border co-operation and develop regional power\ngrids. Action is also needed to drive grid modernisation and expansion and ensure supply-side\nflexibility and demand-side management.\n\nRENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries.\n\nWE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. Annual average investment in renewable\npower generation must reach USD 1 300 billion by 2030, compared to 486 billion in 2022. In the\ndeveloping world, we must minimise investment risks and provide access to low-cost financing.\nThe global financial architecture must be reformed to support the energy transition in the Global\nSouth. Climate-related funding from multilateral development banks must be ramped up, and\npublic capital should be redirected from the fossil fuels sector to renewable energy.\n\nTHIS WILL REQUIRE STRONG INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. Immediate efforts are\nrequired to facilitate and contribute to multilateral initiatives that promote knowledge sharing\nand capacity building to deliver a just transition whilst also safeguarding nature and biodiversity.\nCollaboration is urgently required to foster collective action on governance, climate finance and\ninnovation. North-South and South-South dialogues should be cultivated; groups like the G7 and\nG20 must mobilise support and investment; and just transition funds should be established and\noperationalised in emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its\nlatest Assessment Report (AR6), sent a clear message to the world that this\ndecade is critical to our success in limiting global surface temperature increase\nto 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (IPCC, 2023).\nThere is an urgent need for rapid and immediate action to reduce global net\nanthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by almost 50% from 2019 levels\nby 2030, with a significant proportion of this reduction occurring within the field\nof energy.\n\nHowever, the energy transition remains off-track and global greenhouse gas\nemissions have reached record levels. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels.\nThis is far below the emission reductions required to place the world on a 1.5°C\npathway. The message is clear: we cannot limit global surface temperature\nincrease to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century without\nrapid, sustained and concerted action.\n\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake (GST), through which policy\nmakers, industry, financial institutions, civil society and other stakeholders will\nreflect on the progress achieved in implementing climate pledges since the\nadoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Leveraging low-cost solar PV, onshore and offshore wind, and\nother renewable electricity generation sources, the power sector must lead the way as solutions in other\nsectors scale up. Accelerating the progress of the transition worldwide requires a holistic approach,\nbacked by systemic innovation to transform existing structures and systems built for the fossil fuel era.\n\nWhilst the phase down of fossil fuels is both essential and inevitable, it must also be responsible. The\ntransition needs to be delivered in a way that ensures energy security, accessibility and affordability,\nwhile also sustaining socio-economic development and adopting nature-positive approaches. The\nspeed at which the transition is achieved will be determined by how quickly zero-carbon alternatives can\nbe introduced and scaled up.\n\nGreater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030.\nThese goals represent some of the most important levers for change to advance the energy transition\nthis decade.\n\nThis report consolidates high-level analysis of these targets, detailing existing shortfalls and identifying\nkey enablers to resolve them. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets.\n\nThe solutions presented are technologically mature, cost-competitive and commercially available, and can\nbe scaled up rapidly in most countries around the world; indeed, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind\nare already the most cost-competitive sources of new electricity supply in most countries today (IRENA,\n2023b). Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices.\nIt would also improve air quality and reduce health costs; deliver universal access to clean affordable\nenergy; and provide greater collective security and well-being. With the right policies in place, the global\nenergy transition will also bring extensive socio-economic benefits, including in the form of job creation\nand income generation.\n\nThe key enabling frameworks, policies and recommendations detailed in this report provide concrete\nadvice to governments around the world on the necessary steps required between now and 2030 to meet\nthese targets. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIt is essential that global leaders convening at COP28 demonstrate the collective will to set a new pace for\naction this decade by committing to these targets; in short, this is a critical step in a critical decade to keep\nthe 1.5°C target within reach. This will require accelerated actions in many areas, in particular modernising\nand expanding physical energy infrastructure; improving power system operations; establishing the\nright policies and regulatory frameworks; building resilient supply chains; and developing skills and\ninstitutional capacities. These actions must be underpinned by a significant increase in public and private\nfinancing, particularly to support the developing world.\n\nTo ensure the energy transition is both just and inclusive, greater international\ncollaboration is also needed. Worldwide, around 675 million people still lack access\nto electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking methods (IEA et al., 2023).\nProviding renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nForewords\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sultan Al Jaber\n            COP28 President-Designate\nTripling the deployment of renewable power generation and doubling\n            energy efficiency are amongst the most important levers to cut greenhouse\n            gas emissions.\nThe world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow.\nThe Global Stocktake has told us exactly how far off track we are. We need\n            to cut 22 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases in the next 7 years in order to\n            keep 1.5°C within reach.\nThe phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable and essential, but it must be\n            responsible. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy. Now is the time to turbocharge solutions and meet the\n            urgency of the moment with ambitious and determined action.\nAhead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in\n            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and\n            double energy efficiency.\nThis report outlines actionable solutions that can enable the progress we\n            need and demonstrates that this target is ambitious but achievable.\nI am now calling on everyone to come together, commit to common targets,\n            and take comprehensive domestic and international action, as outlined in\n            this report, to make our ambitions a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco La Camera\n            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency\nOur mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,\n            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency\n            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the\n            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is\n            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action.\nA significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with\n            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is\n            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris\n            Agreement. This will require concerted action to urgently address deeply\n            entrenched systemic barriers across infrastructure, policy and institutional\n            capacities stemming from systems and structures created for the fossil\u0002-fuel era.\nWe must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing\n            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;\n            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted\n            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and\n            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and\n            capabilities match the energy system of the future. This is especially\n            important for developing countries, where we must deliver on our\n            commitments to sustainable development, ensuring no one is left behind.\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake, in which the world\n            reflects on its progress in implementing the Paris Agreement. It is vital that\n            collective action be galvanised following this key milestone in our journey\n            toward a climate-safe existence to ensure the forthcoming round of\n            Nationally Determined Contributions in 2025 represents a transformative\n            leap forward, realigning us with the 1.5°C goal. This report outlines the\n            essential actions governments must prioritise to achieve this objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Douglas\n            Chief Executive Officer, Global Renewables Alliance\nThis is the ‘make or break’ decade to avoid the most catastrophic impacts\n            of climate change. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future.\n            \nDouble down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This\n            would deliver cleaner electricity systems, access to affordable energy and\n            green jobs for millions of people, billions of dollars in public and private\n            capital to foster climate-resilient growth, and reduce loss and damage for\n            nature and people wrought by harmful climate change.\n            \nTo achieve these targets, we need to dramatically ramp up wind power,\n            solar power, hydropower and geothermal power. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. On average, 1 000 GW\n            of renewables needs to be installed each year for the rest of the decade to\n            bring total renewables capacity to 11 000 GW by 2030. As the growth curve\n            will rise over the course of the decade, the renewables industry believes\n            at least 1 500 GW of renewables capacity could be installed in 2030 alone.\n            \nGlobal leaders must commit to these targets at COP28. However, progress\n            towards 2030 goals cannot be taken for granted. Policy makers must\n            work hand-in-hand with industry and civil society to urgently implement\n            the enabling actions in this report, centred on: infrastructure and system\n            operation; policy and regulation; and supply chains, skills and capacities.\n            Critically, these areas must be reinforced by low-cost financing and\n            international collaboration.\n            \nThis is a unique “once in a generation” opportunity, but we need urgent\n            action to scale renewable energy in every region of the world. Only then\n            can we protect the planet and secure a liveable future for all.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPreface\r\n \n\n\n\n\nSince the Rio Earth Summit and the adoption of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, the\nConference of the Parties to the Convention (COP) has convened\nsignatory Parties each year to determine ambitions and responsibilities,\nand identify and assess the progress of climate measures. The 21st\nsession of the COP (COP21) led to the Paris Agreement, which mobilised\ncollective action to limit the increase in global average temperature\nto well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, pursue efforts to limit\nthe temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and\nstrengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.\n\nCOP28, and the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement, can\nbe the turning point on climate action over this critical decade to\naccelerate a transition that puts economies on the path toward a new\nlow-carbon, high-growth, sustainable economic model in a way that\nis both transformational and just. COP28 has the vision to deliver on\nthe pillars of the Paris Agreement, focusing on specific action on four\nparadigm shifts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nfast-tracking the energy transition and slashing emissions before 2030;\ntransforming climate finance, by delivering on old promises and\n    setting the framework for a new deal on finance;\nputting nature, people, lives and livelihoods at the heart of climate\n    action; and\nmobilising for the most inclusive COP ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nDisclaimer and acknowledgements\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThis publication and the material herein are provided “as is”.

According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario identifies a technically and economically feasible pathway to an energy future that\nis consistent with Paris Agreement goals. It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system.\n\nDespite the progress achieved to date, the current deployment of energy transition technologies is\ninsufficient in speed and scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions.\n\nBy 2030, global total installed renewable power generation capacity would need to expand more than\nthree-fold, from 3 382 GW in 2022 to 11 174 GW, according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Specifically,\ninstalled solar PV capacity would rise to more than 5 400 GW, from 1 055 GW in 2022, and wind installations\nwould surpass 3 500 GW (3 040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore), up from 899 GW in 2022, over the\nsame period (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c). The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. After solar PV and\nwind power, the third-largest increase in generation capacity would be in hydropower; by 2030, global\ninstalled hydropower capacity (excluding pumped hydro) would grow by almost 17% from the 2022 level,\nreaching 1 465 GW under the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario.\n\n\nFIGURE 1 Key performance indicators for achieving the 1.5°C Scenario in the Decade for Action\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c).\n\n\nThis suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Energy storage capacity would expand in tandem, with\ncumulative global battery storage increasing by a factor of 21, from 17 GW in 2020 to 359 GW in 2030\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRenewable power additions this decade may not be linear, however, with many factors impacting the\nrate of growth. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Some projections of solar growth foresee that 1 000 GW of annual solar PV installations\nalone may be reached as soon as 2028 (Haegel et al., 2023). To meet the tripling renewable power target,\nannual renewable additions need to ramp up as fast as possible, and as early as possible, in this decade.\n\nCountries and regions will follow different trajectories in accelerating the deployment of renewable\npower capacity. Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. This will allow them to assist others by sharing\nlessons learnt, technological and technical know-how, and experiences in establishing the right\nconditions for the scaling up of renewables.\n\nUnder the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario, the global solar PV market would be dominated by G20 countries; but\noutside this group, cumulative capacity will need to surpass 900 GW by 2030, while the cumulative capacity\nin G20 countries would reach approximately 4 530 GW. For wind, China, the United States, Canada, Brazil\nand several European countries have high onshore wind potential, while the majority of expansions in\noffshore wind would be in four key markets (China, EU-27, the United States and India), accounting for\nmore than 60% of offshore wind deployment by 2030. For hydropower, G20 countries together would\naccount for 79% (over 1 150 GW) of global hydropower capacity by 2030, with almost 305 GW of total\ncapacity spread across the rest of the world.\n\nFIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. Bioenergy includes biogas, biomass\nwaste and biomass solid.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nIt is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022).\n\nAccelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nIn 2010, the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of onshore wind was\nUSD 0.107/kilowatt hour (kWh) – 95% higher than the lowest fossil fuel cost of USD 0.056/kWh. Yet,\nby 2022, the global weighted average LCOE of new onshore wind projects was USD 0.033/kWh – 52%\nlower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option, at USD 0.069/kWh (Figure 3).\n\nThis improvement was surpassed by that of solar PV, however. In 2010, solar PV had a global weighted\naverage LCOE of USD 0.445/kWh – 710% more expensive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option; but\nby 2022, a spectacular decline in costs – to USD 0.049/kWh – made solar PV’s global weighted average\nLCOE 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nFIGURE 3 Cost competitiveness of solar and wind power, 2010-2022\n\nNote: LCOE = levelised cost of electricity.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nThe global weighted-average LCOE of offshore wind fell from being 258% more expensive than the cheapest\nfossil fuel option in 2010 to being just 17% more expensive in 2022, with costs falling from USD 0.197/kWh\nto USD 0.081/kWh. Concentrated solar power (CSP) saw its global weighted average LCOE fall from 591%\nhigher than the cheapest fossil fuel option in 2010 to 71% higher in 2022 (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nWhile hydropower’s global weighted average LCOE increased in 2021-2022 to USD 0.061/kWh – largely\nowing to the development of more challenging and remote sites – it remains cheaper than new\nfossil-fuel fired options. This is also true for geothermal projects, with a global weighted-average LCOE\nof USD 0.056/kWh in 2022, as well as for bioenergy projects, at USD 0.061/kWh (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nIt is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. 2 As 2022\nshowed, the indirect economic benefits of this enhanced energy security can be significant; yet they are\ntypically not valued in current policy.\n\nFIGURE 4 Investments required to meet the 1.5°C goal\n\nSource: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nSimilarly, the economic benefits of reducing pollution, and thereby improving climate, environmental and\nhealth outcomes, are almost never properly valued in policy-setting (IRENA, 2023b). These unpriced\nbenefits significantly improve the competitiveness of renewable power and make the business case for\naccelerated deployment even more compelling.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. This represents a transformative shift in power system\nsupply dynamics and poses new challenges to power system operations. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies.\n\nIn recent years, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity – known as ‘green hydrogen’ – and its\nderivatives have been identified as industrial feedstocks for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors.\nHydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. These measures can often generate\neconomic and environmental co-benefits. A range of measures will be needed across all end-use sectors,\nincluding modal shifts from private passenger cars to collective transport, and from passenger aviation\nand road-based freight to rail, as well as the adoption of circular economy principles, improved building\ninsulation, heat pumps and efficient electric motors – especially for industrial end-use sectors.\n\nEnergy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification.\nThe electrification of end-use sectors – such as in transport and buildings – would see a rise in direct use\nof electricity in total final energy consumption from 22% in 2020 to 29% in 2030.\n\nTechnical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nTo align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). If this rate is achieved, global final energy consumption would experience\nminimal growth over the same period.\n\nWith renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made.\n\nFIGURE 5 Energy intensity: Indicators in transport and buildings in 2030\n Based on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants.\nThis will require enhancements to – and expansion of – current power\ngrid systems, and the modernisation and upgrading of power system\noperations.\n\nWith VRE sources becoming the major source of power in a\n1.5°C-compatible world, countries must start upgrading and\nexpanding their power grid infrastructure to prepare for increasing\nend-use sector electrification. Multiple measures are required,\nincluding:\n\n\nInnovative power planning, grid expansion, modernisation and\n    enhancement, and addressing interconnection backlogs (projects\n    awaiting connection to the grid).\n    \nChanges in grid operation and management, potentially also\n    including new market design.\n    \nIncreased interconnectors between countries and regions.\n    \nGrowth in electricity storage; comprising short-duration storage\n    for increasing grid flexibility and long-duration storage to enhance\n    energy security (e.g. pumped storage).\n    \nMeasures to allow greater integration of demand-side management\n    and behind-the-meter (consumer) flexibility options (e.g. distributed\n    storage).\n    \nIntroducing other flexibility sources (e.g. green hydrogen, hybrid\n    renewable parks combining wind/solar/storage, etc.).\n    \n\n\nFIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). 4  With clarity on grid infrastructure development\nplans and reasonable guarantees on connection availability, investors will feel more confident building\nnew generation; meanwhile, consumers would be more likely to invest in electrification when a reliable\nsupply of low-cost electricity can be made available.\n\nWhen integrating higher shares of locally available variable solar and wind power, power systems will\nalso need to innovate to become: increasingly decentralised, allowing electricity to be generated at\nlocations closer to demand; and bi-directional, allowing electricity from distributed power generating\nfacilities to be injected into the grid.\n\nModernised, smarter grids are required; in the European Union (EU), around 30% of the envisaged\ninvestment in grids by 2030 could be earmarked for digitalisation 5  (European Commission, 2022).\nThey will also need to be larger and more robust. Hence, grid costs are expected to increase over time\n(IRENA, 2023a). This will require fast-tracked permitting to ensure timely investments in modern grids.\nAdding more widely distributed power generation sources will also bring resilience, especially against\nincreasingly intense extreme weather events owing to climate change (IPCC, 2023).\n\nThe electrification of transport also requires significant investments in enabling infrastructure. Electric\nvehicles will potentially account for more than 80% of all road transport activity by 2050; with 359 million\nelectric and plug-in hybrid light passenger vehicles worldwide by 2030 and 2 182 million by 2050 (IRENA,\n2023a); yet their market entry will be contingent upon coordinated investments in charging infrastructure\nand power grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure planning, timelines and assessments of investment needs for grids are aligned with long-term targets for renewable energy buildout and end-use sector decarbonisation, e.g. transport.\nMobilise funds for long-term grid investment; channel donor finance to building capacity and\n    infrastructure for integrating renewables; and streamline permitting procedures for new grid\n    infrastructure and upgrades to existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.\nDevelop modernised, decentralised (where suitable) and more resilient grid systems using\n    digitalisation, smart applications for demand-side management and interconnections with\n    neighbouring grid systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur.\nHistorically, this has been provided by pumped storage and hydropower with reservoirs.\nHowever, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). All of these technologies are undergoing rapid\ninnovation.\n\nFIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. saving energy from spring days with low loads and abundant solar to deploy\nduring high load days in the summer; or from windy autumn days to deploy during high load cloudy winter\ndays). Diverse storage technologies enhance the resilience of grids that are subject to extreme weather\nfor prolonged periods, help relieve grid congestion, provide transmission services and shore up local\narea reliability.\n\nLDES, including storage technologies spanning 10+, 24+, 100+ and 150+ hours in duration and providing\nboth power and heat, is also able to provide other grid services including black start (restarting parts\nof the grid where power has been lost in a blackout) and micro-grid level assistance for areas or key\ninfrastructure that may lose power. Storage durations can span weeks or months in the case of pumped\nstorage and reservoir hydropower. As the largest form of installed flexibility at over 175 GW worldwide,\npumped storage hydropower can play an important role in providing LDES and vital grid services, with\nsubstantial potential for off-river pumped storage to be developed in the coming decades (IHA, 2023).\nSome LDES technologies are commercially available today, while others are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Numerous companies are signing contracts (e.g. with utilities, airports, data centres,\nindustrial users, etc.) and are deploying LDES at grid-scale quantities, and pumped storage has been\nsuccessfully deployed for decades.\n\nOne emerging LDES technology is hydrogen storage. Hydrogen’s true competitive strength lies in its\nunique ability to store energy for long periods of time in large quantities. As green hydrogen displaces\nfossil fuels in some end uses, hydrogen storage could become increasingly critical to energy security,\nin the same way that natural gas storage is today in many regions. Hydrogen storage will be needed\nprimarily to meet variation in supply (rather than demand), as green hydrogen is created using VRE\nsources. Long-term hydrogen storage can play an important role in strengthening energy security and\nsystem resilience (IRENA, 2023d). Support for the continued development of these technologies is\ncritical for decarbonisation.\n\nIn many places, however, legacy market arrangements and policy frameworks do not incentivise\ninvestment in storage at scale. Action from policy makers can drive progress in this sector, such as:\nassessing energy storage and flexibility needs; setting LDES mandates for medium- and long-term\ncapacity targets; updating criteria for marketplaces; providing innovation grants and subsidies for prefeasibility studies; and establishing public-private partnerships.\n\nOther market innovations can also foster a healthy storage market, such as the introduction of congestion\nmanagement trading platforms, ancillary services markets to support the grid, and awarding additional\nvalue for features such as flexibility in capacity payments and capability to provide peaking power\n(e.g. storage technologies that can replace a natural gas peaking plant should be reflected in system\nmodelling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConduct technical assessments of system decarbonisation needs and timelines, and ensure the\n    planned buildout of renewables is complemented by storage resources of varying duration, as\n    well as other sources of flexibility.\nCollaborate with regulators and the renewables sector to enhance power market planning and\n    ensure price signals, clear targets and procurement incentivise longer duration storage.\nEncourage investment and innovation in diverse storage technologies to suit different users, such\n    as by establishing research, development and innovation (RDI) grant programmes, encouraging\n    public–private partnerships and setting medium- and long-term capacity targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-use electrification and sector coupling\nWith solar and wind power scaling up rapidly in this decade, electrification has become a vital\ndecarbonisation pathway. Green hydrogen and its derivatives, produced by electrolysers using low-cost\nrenewable power, can be used to decarbonise end-use sectors that are difficult to electrify directly –\nsuch as iron and steel making, and shipping – and to provide seasonal energy storage solutions.\n\nHowever, electrification needs to be accelerated by systemic innovation, making it not only faster but\nsmarter. Smart electrification – through sector coupling and enhanced flexibility – prevents a higher peak\nelectricity load on the power system. It also enables the power system to accommodate new loads while\nallowing integration of a higher share of variable renewable electricity in a cost-efficient manner. This\ncan help sustain renewables-based electrification without jeopardising energy system operation, thus\nmaking the power system robust and resilient. To harness all these benefits, systemic innovation should\ninvolve the entire energy value chain across four key dimensions: technology and infrastructure; market\ndesign and regulation; system planning and operation; and business models (IRENA, 2023d). Smart\ncharging for electric vehicles is a good example in this regard.\n\nSector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nThe benefit of this will be smarter, more intelligent demand-side management, achieved by deploying\nmore advanced digital technologies both behind-the-meter (by energy consumers) and in power\nsystems. Demand response would become more agile and inter-operational through sector-coupled\ntechnologies such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to smart charging\nfacilities. This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nEnd-use electrification, sector-coupling and the rapid scale-up of variable renewable electricity all\nrequire integrated cross-sectoral infrastructure planning – a process for optimising the co-development\nof increasingly connected infrastructure in various sectors. 7 The European Hotmaps project offers an\nopen-source toolbox to support public authorities, energy agencies and urban planners as they plan\nheating and cooling at local, regional and national levels. It allows users to map cooling and heating\ndemand, as well as supply, in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom, and provides renewable\nenergy generation and industrial waste heat potentials (Hotmaps, 2021). This facilitates the integration\nof heating and cooling with waste-to-energy and renewable energy, including power-to-heat. However,\nthis planning approach requires incentives for infrastructure investments where market barriers exist,\ngiven that different infrastructures operate under different legislative, regulatory and policy regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt a sector-coupling approach to the decarbonisation of economies by pursuing smart\n    electrification of the transport, buildings and industry sectors.\nCreate fora for co-ordinated planning among relevant authorities on infrastructure development,\n    including renewable energy projects, grid and transmission assets, electric vehicle charging\n    infrastructure and heat networks.\nIntroduce economic incentives for smart electrification and demand-side response (such as tax\n    credits and innovation grants) to encourage private investment in sector-coupling solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand-side management\nElectricity systems are complex; in addition to the grid infrastructure planning required to unlock the\nbenefits of sector coupling, distributed grid planning and operations will need well-defined energy\nmanagement schemes on both sides of the end-user meter. These schemes apply to both the supply side\n(power management) and demand side (load management).\nDemand-side management (DSM) comprises a set of strategies traditionally aimed at reducing peak\ndemand, which will be increasingly needed to incentivise consumption in periods of high VRE generation.\nDSM addresses various challenges, including VRE integration, rising electricity costs and environmental\nimpacts. For example, DSM can employ time-of-use pricing to encourage customers to shift electricity\nusage to off-peak hours, while demand response programmes can financially reward customers for\nreducing electricity usage during peak hours or consuming electricity during high VRE generation\nperiods. Critical-peak pricing, real-time pricing and critical-peak rebates are also among the strategies\navailable. These approaches are crucial for optimising energy efficiency in both residential and industrial\nbuildings.\nAs the transition advances, DSM will also provide flexibility to alleviate the need for more costly\nrequirements. Several challenges persist, however – particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, and other Global South regions. Notable issues include physical grid and digital technology\ninfrastructure gaps, as well as complex and inconsistent regulations and policies. Financing challenges\nalso hinder progress; attracting investment in clean energy enablers like DSM solutions requires\ninnovative financing models and incentives.\nIntelligent load control, demand response and energy efficiency are pivotal in enabling a secure and\nresilient renewables-based power system. Continued investment and innovation in these areas will\nfurther drive the adaptation of demand to supply in a renewable energy-driven future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAssess the cost-benefit of investment in DSM programmes, accounting for the energy and cost\n    savings it can provide instead of investing in grid infrastructure expansion.\nEnsure grid planning prioritises modernisation and DSM technology to close critical technology\n    gaps as infrastructure expands. Developing economies can explore innovative financing models –\n    such as blended finance – to mobilise investment in grid and DSM solutions.\nImprove data availability within the wider electricity system to enable innovation in DSM and\n    access to applications like smart meters by consumers and third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nGovernments have a crucial role to play in tripling renewable power capacity and placing the world on a\n1.5°C pathway. All too often, the energy transition discourse relegates governments’ responsibilities to\ncreating an enabling environment for private investments through predictable and stable policies, and\nthe creation of instruments that de-risk investment projects. Although this is crucial, a much broader and\nmore integrated policy approach is required to facilitate the adoption of an entire spectrum of energy\ntransition solutions needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and unlock its socio-economic benefits (Figure 8).\n\nGovernments need to be far more engaged in shaping and guiding the energy transition, including through\npolicies for ambitious public investment programmes and sufficient forward-planning for renewables\nscale-up, system integration and grid build-out.\n\nCross-cutting approaches covering all renewable technologies, electrification technologies and others\nare needed to facilitate the energy transition (e.g. energy storage), include enabling policies that set\nambitions and send clear signals to stakeholders, eliminate distortions, incentivise the uptake of solutions\nand facilitate access to affordable financing. They also include policies that ensure the integration of\nrenewables within energy systems, economies, nature and societies, as well as specific deployment\npolicies for various technologies. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand.\n\nTransitioning to a renewables-based economy may also bring challenges in the form of financing gaps,\nlabour market disruptions and energy sector insecurity. These misalignments, if not well-managed,\nrisk inequitable outcomes and a slower pace of the energy transition. Therefore, a set of structural and\njust transition policies, along with the creation of strong institutions to ensure policy co-ordination and\ncohesion, is required to manage potential misalignments.\n\nFinally, a holistic global policy framework that entails international collaboration including North-South\nand South-South co-operation is needed to bring stakeholders from countries around the world together\nto commit to a just transition that leaves no one behind and strengthens international finance flows,\ncapacities and technologies in an equitable manner.\n\nThis section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nFIGURE 8 The IRENA holistic policy framework for a just and inclusive energy transition\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2021b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Enhanced energy efficiency is a crucial enabler for making high\nlevels of end-use electrification feasible and affordable. Measures related to reducing energy demand\nand improving efficiency are needed across all end-use sectors.\n\nMinimum energy performance standards (MEPS) can support industrial, commercial and residential\nusers to procure and switch to more energy efficient appliances or equipment such as electric heating/\ncooling technologies. Building codes can set energy performance requirements by specifying insulation\nstandards, thereby reducing heating and cooling demands. They can also specify greenhouse gas\nemission targets and carbon footprints. For renovation, in particular, codes can be coupled with financial\nincentives.\n\nIt is also important to address prevailing challenges associated with building ownership structures,\nequitable access and benefit-sharing of energy efficiency investments and policies. “Green loans” could\ncarry lower interest rates and protect low-income energy consumers from energy price fluctuations\nand inflationary environments. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.\n\nIn the transport sector, significant improvements can be achieved by promoting energy efficient mobility\n(e.g. public transport such as railways, metros and buses, and car-sharing), as well as active (nonmotorised) transport such as cycling and walking in urban areas. Public campaigns can be undertaken by\nnational and local governments to encourage green mobility modes. Other policies, such as differentiated\nparking fees and highway tolls, can encourage a shift to public transport, complemented by dedicated\ndriving lanes for car-sharing. Public transportation fleets also offer the opportunity to utilise costcompetitive renewable fuels or electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement with specific time horizons and outline\n    clear avenues for implementation.\n    \nStrengthen regulatory frameworks, including building codes that specify low energy performance\n    and appliance energy efficiency standards.\n    \nExpand the availability of financial incentives and affordable lending schemes for meeting\n    standards on energy efficiency, such as tax credits or green loans with favourable interest rates\n    for building renovation or modernisation.\n    \nEstablish public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy efficiency measures, public\n    transport and green mobility for cost savings and collective decarbonisation goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket incentives and fiscal policy\nWhile renewables have become increasingly competitive, they still face barriers compared to fossil fuels.\nRising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective. The choice of instrument and its design should consider: the nature of the solution\n(e.g. utility-scale, distributed, off-grid); level of development of the sector; power system organisational\nstructure; wider macroeconomic environment (e.g. impact of inflation and commodity price volatility);\nand broader policy objectives. It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below). This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk. A mechanism to allow for bilateral power\nprocurement between generators and private off-takers (such as industrial actors or corporates) can\nfurther strengthen the case for large deployment volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments.\n    \nIntroduce tax credits, levies and/or exemptions on import/export duties for key materials and\n    components in the renewable energy supply chain.\n    \nEnsure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains.\n    \nConsider the trade-offs between ‘lowest-price’ objectives, and other policy outcomes such as\n    socio-economic development, system integration and industry sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower market design and regulation\nThe world is entering a new era in which electricity systems will be increasingly dominated by zeromarginal-cost renewable technologies. Power markets must evolve and adapt to new market forces,\nsuch as corporate and industrial demand, and behind-the-meter (prosumer) generation. They must be\norganised in a way that incentivises new investment in renewable power generation and the flexibility to\nprovide reliable electricity at a level required for the 1.5°C pathway. This requires governments and other\nstakeholders to undertake a close examination of their power systems’ organisational structures, i.e. the\ninstitutions, processes and arrangements through which electricity services are exchanged and rewarded.\n\nWholesale power markets today are based on marginal cost pricing, where the most expensive\ngenerator (with the highest variable cost – typically fossil fuel-fired plants) determines electricity\nprices for the time period in which the market operates. This poses a number of challenges. As the\nshare of renewable power grows, wholesale spot markets will see increased price volatility, as periods\nof high renewable power generation push clearing prices in the wholesale market close to zero. When\nrenewable generation is less than demand, flexibility resources will be needed, potentially resulting in\nvery high prices at certain times.\n\nIf wholesale markets are the main source of revenue, the economic feasibility of new investments will\nplummet, as even existing generators will struggle to recover their initial capital costs whilst prospective\ninvestors realise diminishing returns. The paradigm that relies on free markets to incentivise power\nsupply investment decisions therefore needs to change.\n\nUltimately, a renewables-based power system requires enhanced flexibility; wholesale market design\nmust deliver this as well as providing the volume of renewable power needed. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.\n\nPower system organisational structures must evolve to better align with energy policy and\ndecarbonisation goals. A “dual procurement” power market design could introduce long-term\ncontract mechanisms (e.g. Auctions, CfDs, PPAs) as the backbone of renewable power procurement,\nalongside a short-term market to dispatch flexible resources in an affordable way (IRENA, 2022a).\nThis holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system.\n\nThis transformation is partially underway, as auctions are becoming the preferred tool to procure\nrenewable energy, and wholesale markets are becoming more time and location granular (IRENA,\n2023a); but there are meaningful actions authorities can take now to ensure the acceleration of this trend.\n\nOne way to achieve enhanced system flexibility is for power markets to allow flexibility technologies\n(such as batteries and pumped hydropower) to provide ancillary services and be rewarded accordingly.\nAncillary services that serve to stabilise the grid network and will become increasingly important as\ndispatchable fossil fuel-based generation is phased out of the power mix. Today, many power systems\nreward the provision of energy but not ancillary services (where these services are not included in\ncontractual obligations). They therefore need to be appropriately valued and reflected in power system\ndesign. Valuing, pricing and procuring ancillary services astutely can bring new players to the grid, with\nadvantages for the whole power system. Examples of this include the enhanced frequency regulation\nauctions in the UK.\n\nTo achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This includes growth in distributed renewable energy\ngeneration systems – notably using solar PV – but also community solar and wind projects. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. Such measures can maximise the socio-economic benefits of renewable energy, insulate consumers from price volatility, create local supply\nchains and job opportunities, and enhance public perceptions of renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors.\nDesign auctions that balance competitive price discovery and long-term delivery of affordable\n    electricity. Auctions should also be run for sufficiently large and ambitious volumes, with\n    consistent, transparent tendering schedules to effectively foster competitive bidding.\nCreate a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix.\nRethink participation rules to allow new technologies to engage in the power market as flexibility\n    providers, including storage and demand side aggregators.\nEncourage investment in distributed renewable energy systems that allow consumers to become\n    “prosumers” by both using and producing clean electricity.\nReorganise power market structures to ensure policies for accelerating renewables deployment\n    account for system flexibility as well as sustainable returns to generators and investors.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamlining permitting\nThe time and cost constraints imposed by permitting procedures represent a major bottleneck\nimpacting the deployment of renewable energy projects in many countries. It is essential that permitting\nprocedures are fit-for-purpose and keep pace with renewable and climate targets, without compromising\nenvironmental and social impact standards. Experiences from the public and private sectors indicate\nthat best practices in permitting centre on four areas: administrative consolidation; digitalisation; policy\nsupport; and public engagement (European Commission, 2023).\n\nRenewable energy developers often need to consult numerous authorities at national, sub-national and\nsometimes village or prefecture level for the necessary permits to build a project. This process can be\nlengthy and extremely bureaucratic; for instance, the global average time required for permitting an\noffshore wind project is nine years. Onshore wind and utility-scale PV permitting processes can also\nbe long, although they are typically shorter than those for offshore wind. Similar obstacles exist for\nhydropower projects and smaller scale distributed projects for end consumers using renewable energy\ntechnologies like rooftop solar.\n\nCreating dedicated, centralised authorities is one way to streamline this process by ensuring developers\ncan refer to a single focal point. Countries like Denmark and the Philippines have already adopted a “one-stop shop” model to accelerate renewables deployment, but this model only works if it is adequately\nresourced. In addition, digitalised processes to submit and track applications would enable developments\nto progress more efficiently, while access to digitised local consenting and historical dispute records\nwould allow developers and authorities to screen sites that could be high-risk or unsuitable at an early\nstage (IRENA, 2023h).\n\nAn overarching best practice is the introduction of legislation mandating a maximum lead time for the\npermitting of renewable energy projects. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. Gaining social acceptance through\npublic engagement with relevant stakeholders is critical in the consenting and constructing stages of a\nrenewable energy project. This includes early and continuous consultation by authorities and developers\nwith local communities to communicate the benefits and considerations brought by a project to the area,\nas well as a transparent conflict resolution mechanism that sincerely addresses community concerns.\n\nComprehensive and efficient permitting frameworks represent a clear win-win, allowing renewable\nenergy development to expand this decade while cultivating acceptance with other interests in land and\nsea spaces. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023).\n\nRecent studies indicate that adopting best practices in permitting could cut consenting time for utility-scale wind and solar projects by more than half; for example, onshore wind farms could be permitted in\none year, offshore wind farms in 1.5 years and solar farms in as little as three months (ETC, 2023). This\nmakes permitting a high-impact enabler for the energy transition, where the necessary investment in\nresource, policy support and capacity will bring enormous value to countries in accelerating renewables\ngrowth and securing associated socio-economic and environmental benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023).\n\nThe energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. If not well managed, these\nmisalignments risk inequitable outcomes, which could sow doubt among policy makers and the\npublic concerning the advantages of the transition and lead to a fractured and unco-ordinated policy\nenvironment. Hence, there is a need for policies and measures that equitably distribute the benefits of\nthe energy transition and raise public awareness about these positive impacts.\n\nIn terms of jobs, sectoral misalignments may arise due to potential shifts in value and supply chains\nduring the energy transition. For instance, transitioning from fossil fuel power generation to solar energy\nmay shift the focus from fuel extraction to the semi-conductor industry. The impact on employment\ndepends on factors such as domestic production and labour productivity. Labour-market interventions\nencompass adequate employment services attuned to evolving circumstances and needs, along with\nmeasures to facilitate labour mobility (IRENA and ILO, 2023).\n\nCommunity benefit schemes span countries from Costa Rica to Mali and adopt a range of structures,\nfrom shared ownership of renewable assets to industry sponsorship of critical social and economic\ninfrastructure in host communities (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2020). Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions.\n\nAligning policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition will facilitate local\nvalue creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, and on a larger scale, ensure political\nand social stability as renewable energy expands.\n\nAs part of a sensitive and efficient permitting framework, renewable development must be well integrated\nwith the principles of sustainability, circular economy and reduced environmental impact – particularly\non land use and biodiversity. This also applies to enabling infrastructure, with grid expansion into remote\nand biodiverse areas requiring careful siting.\n\nAdopting sustainable end-of-life management policies, including waste management legislation, can\nhelp countries prepare for the anticipated volumes of equipment waste such as solar PV panels and\nbatteries. Research and development programmes across the energy and waste sectors, and industrial\nclusters, can help to further scale waste management infrastructure on a national or regional basis\n(IRENA and IEA, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition and foster local\n    value creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, with a special focus on the\n    inclusion of marginalised groups.\nAnticipate labour market disruptions and establish programmes that can address workforce\n    gaps, minimise labour misalignments, create opportunities for targeted recruitment and labour\n    mobility, such as relocation grants, and establish social protection programmes.\nMinimise adverse environmental impacts and encourage nature-positive approaches, for example\n    by incentivising the uptake of sustainability standards for new renewable energy assets – such as\n    the Hydropower Sustainability Standard – as part of procurement schemes.\nEnsure the impacts of mining activities and the use of relatively scarce components are mitigated\n    through provisions for circular economy (end-of-life management, recycling and reuse of materials).\nGather information on renewables’ waste production through regular monitoring of waste\n    produced by technology, the composition of waste streams, installed system performance and the\n    causes and frequency of system failures, in order to adopt waste minimisation legislation suitable\n    for the pace and scale of the transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\r\n \n\n\n\n\nBuilding resilient supply chains\nThe vulnerabilities of key energy industries to logistics bottlenecks, commodity price volatility, trade\nbarriers, and commodity and component import dependencies have become increasingly apparent in\nrecent years. Energy supply chains have become a priority agenda for policy makers, as demand and\ncompetition for critical raw materials, rare earth elements and production capacity become more acute.\n\nWithout well-functioning and cost-efficient industrial supply chains, the energy transition will not\nmaterialise. If not well managed, competition, security and scarcity challenges in renewable energy\nsupply chains could lead to a disorderly transition, characterised by slower rates of renewables\ndeployment at inflated costs. A mismatch between supply and demand for several critical minerals is\nalready evident, with particularly high levels observed for lithium – a key material required for the shortduration energy storage and electric transport sectors (IRENA, 2023e). Bottlenecks for key components\nin the wind industry – e.g. nacelles, blades and gearboxes – are set to emerge by the second half of this\ndecade in Asia and the Americas (GWEC, 2023). High concentration risk in the global renewables supply\nchain also raises the prospect of price or security of supply uncertainty in the future.\n\nRobust and resilient global supply chains are required to support a 1.5°C pathway. The mining and\nprocessing of critical materials including lithium, copper, nickel and other rare earth metals are\nconstrained within specific geographies, exposing these supply chains to geopolitical tensions and\nconcentration risks (IRENA, 2023e). Policy makers should work with the private sector to identify\nproduction gaps and supply chain weaknesses on a national and regional basis, and generate strategies\nto reinforce supply chain security.\n\nSocially responsible procurement is another key issue, where many critical materials and components\nrefined or manufactured in one country are imported by others for use in the renewables sector. It will\nbe vital to ensure supply chains – in the mining and processing segments in particular – are managed\nwith respect to fair trade, and high environmental, social governance (ESG) and sustainability standards.\nResilient supply chains are also key to sustaining the cost-value proposition of renewable energy around\nthe world.\n\nAs countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. The need for local value creation and regional supply chain\ninvestment must be carefully balanced with reducing trade barriers for goods and services central to\nthe renewables renewables industry. This will be key to avoid intensifying supply chain bottlenecks\nand making renewables less cost-competitive, while maximising socio-economic benefits.\n\nMultilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. This will require governments to work with industry, civil society and other stakeholders to\nensure supply chain planning is conducted through a wider lens that encompasses national interests,\ncost-effective and socially responsible sourcing, long-term social and environmental sustainability, and\nclimate and renewable energy targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate with the renewables industry on industrial development reviews and plans for the\n    transition that are sustainable, achievable, and adequately mitigate risk of supply insecurity\n    and price volatility. Approaches include diversifying sources of production, anticipating critical\n    production gaps and localising value chains.\nEnsure socially responsible procurement of renewables by encouraging uptake of sustainable\n    supply chain assurance schemes, such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative.\nIncentivise public–private partnerships and investment in circularity to encourage reuse of\n    materials and a circular economy approach to project development, which can help to reduce\n    concentration risk and supply insecurity of critical materials.\nCo-operate with international fora and financial institutions to safeguard international trade\n    corridors for materials and components for key renewable energy technologies.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation, training and capacity-building\nBuilding a skilled energy transition workforce requires measures to both expand the talent pipeline and\nenhance the quality of education and training provisions.\n\nEarly exposure to renewable energy topics and careers is vital for sparking interest in pursuing a career in the\nsector, but also to increase social acceptance by a knowledgeable citizenry. The curricula at higher education\nand vocational training institutions must reflect the skills and competences required by the transition.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the content of education and training programmes, it is also important to\nenhance the instructional methods used. For example, experiential learning methods where students are\nencouraged to develop problem-solving strategies can help to prepare learners for jobs in the constantly\nevolving renewable energy sector, where independent knowledge-seeking will often be necessary.\n\nFacilitating collaboration between government agencies on workforce development, industry and\neducational institutions will contribute to more co-ordinated skill-matching efforts. It is vital to consider\nhow a just transition can respond to potential labour displacement in the existing energy sector workforce\nand re-skill or upskill appropriately.\n\nTargeted measures to train, recruit and retain women and other underrepresented or marginalised groups\n(including older workers, ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities and those on a low\nincome) will ensure the dividends of the transition are enjoyed by all. This inclusion can be implemented\nthrough early exposure to renewable energy leadership and career pathways, targeted scholarships,\ngovernment-funded training opportunities, and industry apprenticeship and mentorship schemes.\n\nOutside the renewables industry, it is equally important to ensure sufficiently skilled and trained workers\nare available in government departments concerned with international trade, supply chains, electric\ncharging infrastructure and land use. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government.\n\nCarefully designed public-private partnerships (PPPs) can also play a crucial role in improving overall\ntraining quality while meeting sectoral labour requirements, promoting national skill standards and\nmatchmaking communities with workplace training opportunities. In addition to improving training\ncontent, PPPs can also play a role in shifting the financing of training provisions to a more integrated\napproach that incorporates multiple funding mechanisms including payroll-based training levies, tax\nincentives, scholarships and donations, vouchers and student loans (Dunbar, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign workforce planning among all stakeholders, including labour agencies, labour unions, the\n    wider energy industry and educational institutions, to identify critical skill gaps and workforce\n    needs in advance, and to design skill-building strategies accordingly.\nProvide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition.\nEnsure energy transition goals are reflected in educational programmes and resources, such\n    as university curricula, vocational training institutions, occupational health and safety training\n    institutions, and professional education programmes.\nBuild the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce.\nInvest in reskilling and upskilling measures for vulnerable communities and those in fossil fuel\n    industries to ensure the employment benefits of the transition are extended to a wide subset of\n    the population. Such measures need to be embedded in broader regional economic revitalisation\n    programmes and investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). However, investments remain focused on a few technologies and concentrated\nin a limited number of countries. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). This trend is reflected in renewable power\ncapacity additions, as all of Africa accounted for less than 2% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA,\n2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023).\n\nTo achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. It is equally important that investments to modernise power grids and enhance operational flexibility\nincrease from the annual average investment of USD 274 billion in 2022 to USD 605 billion by 2030. 10 \n\nThis presents a dual challenge: 1) how to scale existing investment flows in countries and technologies;\nand 2) how to ensure these investment flows reach countries that are currently underserved by the\nenergy transition. Efforts to address the much higher cost of capital faced by developing economies –\nas much as three to five times more than in most OECD countries – are also needed (IRENA, 2023f). A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects.\n\nRepurposing public capital from the fossil fuel sector, including both direct investments and financial\nsupport in the form of subsidies, can help accelerate progress towards unlocking the capital required.\nThis public money can then catalyse private capital flows, amplifying investment efforts towards the\nUSD 35 trillion required (for the energy transition as a whole) in the remainder of this decade.\n\nFor example, public financial flows to fossil fuels in the G20 countries alone reached USD 1.4 trillion in\n2022 – more than double 2019 levels. Moreover, G20 governments supported the global fossil fuel industry\nthrough international aid, export credit support and concessional financing (such as equity, grants, loans\nand loan guarantees) at an average of USD 50 billion per year from 2019 to 2021 (IISD, 2023).\n\nPublic funding is urgently needed for basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to\ndrive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as industry and transport,\nor synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investment is scarce. Without this, the gap in\ninvestment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen, to the detriment of\nbillions of people and the success of a just and inclusive global energy transition.\n\nA more comprehensive definition of risk around investing in energy assets is needed. A narrow focus on\nthe return risk to investors must expand to encompass environmental and social risks. This approach,\nwhich should be exercised through rigorous international benchmarks and protocols for investment,\ncan also help to shift funding from fossil fuel assets to the renewables sector. With limited public funds\navailable in the developing world, the international community must step up.\n\nPublic funds (domestic or through international collaboration) must flow through intermediaries\n(e.g. governments, development finance institutions and global funds such as the Green Climate Fund).\nSuch instruments should channel public funds towards policies that support structural change and a\njust transition. Furthermore, these instruments should be designed progressively to ensure economic\nbenefits are shared in an equitable way.\n\nFinally, public investments are needed for economic interventions to support a more equitable\ndistribution of benefits from large-scale renewables growth. National carbon pricing revenues,\nfor example, could be redirected to support clean, affordable electricity access for lower-income\nhouseholds on a progressive basis.\n\nIt is also important to actively engage the private sector, given that public financing alone will not be\nanywhere near sufficient to address the huge investment needs for the global energy transition. The public\nsector can play a catalysing role by providing a conducive and predictable enabling environment for the\nlong-term investment decisions made in the private sector. Also, governments can set the right conditions\nfor private sector actors to build and finance a viable pipeline of energy transition-oriented projects.\n\nFor example, blended finance structures would allow concessional public finance, and even philanthropic\ngrant-based finance, to improve the risk-return profile of an investment, so that private capital is\nattracted at lower cost and/or better terms (IRENA, 2023g). Banks can also pool loans to relatively\nsmall renewables projects into a securitised product aimed at impact-minded investors, including retail\ninvestors who otherwise have few avenues to earn returns while funding renewables deployment (GFMA\nand BCG, 2020). The resulting financial portfolio of projects would reduce the perceived risk associated\nwith its individual components. Such an approach would require a level of contract standardisation to\nenable the bundling of small projects (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nWhile there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. In addition to the measures described above, capital mobilisation schemes like green\nbonds for renewables, as well as international coalition-building to guide distribution of renewables\ninvestment between the Global North and Global South, will be crucial to ensure renewables can\nequitably scale this decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation).\n    \nPromote the adoption of a comprehensive definition of investment risk within public and private\n    institutions that encompasses environmental and social externalities, thereby aligning financial\n    decision-making with broader public and social goals.\n    \nCollaborate with public and private sector actors to develop innovative, context-specific financing\n    and business models that address renewable energy financing gaps in underinvested countries.\n    This involves utilising blended finance, green bonds, financial aggregation, and innovative risk\n    mitigation tools tailored to each country’s unique needs.\n    \nDirect the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access.\n    \nFor Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. A fractured and unaligned approach to renewables deployment will lead\nto missed opportunities for countries to accelerate growth and enjoy the benefits of clean electricity,\nparticularly in the Global South. Public and private stakeholders alike are responsible for enhancing\nparticipation in multilateral initiatives that can facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building to\ndeliver a just transition via a 1.5°C pathway.\n\nWith the lion’s share of renewables investment benefiting developed economies, it will be important to\nstrengthen North-South and South-South collaboration to maximise the social and economic benefits\nfrom clean industrialisation. Country blocs such as the G20 can be powerful coalitions to mobilise support\nand investment around the global renewable energy target and its key enablers.\n\nMobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables.\n\nAdvanced economies are better positioned to mobilise public financing, but global policy frameworks are\nnecessary to secure affordable funding to underpin the energy transition at the national level elsewhere. In\nemerging economies, just transition funds need to be established to support plant closures, communities\nin transition, repurposing/rehabilitation, and retraining and skilling, among other priorities. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. A high proportion of the public funding mobilised will need to\nbe grant-based, avoiding the danger of adding to already high debt burdens faced by many countries.\n\nInternational climate finance has a key role to play in providing the public financing necessary for a just and\nfair energy transition. Its function will vary depending on the context; fossil fuel-dependent communities\nand countries will require targeted efforts to unwind lock-ins to the fossil fuel economy and plan an\nalternative development trajectory based on renewable power generation and economic activities (CPR,\n2021). Countries where mitigation requirements consistent with climate targets go beyond their fair\nshare of the global mitigation burden will require support to trigger the needed collaborative framework,\nleapfrog to renewables-based energy systems and reap their share of the transition benefits.\n\nIt will be important to ensure definitions, standards, governance and investment protocols for the\nenergy transition are fairly aligned to effectively funnel capital to renewables development that meets\nhigh social and environmental standards. From green taxonomy to emissions reduction standards, the\nneed for common ground in the renewables and green hydrogen sectors will be increasingly helpful for\nmultinational investors, companies and civil society actors to navigate the transition.\n\nInternational collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. There are many areas for continued innovation and learning, from DSM\nto LDES to green hydrogen derivatives – all of which will have a positive impact on decarbonisation.\nPlatforms for knowledge-sharing and imparting lessons learnt, such as the IRENA Collaborative Frameworks or the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), are important vehicles to ensure ambition\ncan be transformed into effective action at country level. This is particularly important for those countries\nthat are most vulnerable to the severe impacts of climate change, and so face more significant challenges\nto protect communities without adequate support for adaptation measures (UNCTAD, 2022).\n\nFinally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy.\nThe ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). Scaling up grid planning will support a more economic and\nsustainable approach to the transition, enabling better system balancing and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. This requires public-private platforms that bring governments together with financial institutions, renewable energy\n    developers and supply chain actors, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.\n    \nEnsure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth.\nEncourage robust standards and investment protocols for the transition that can allocate capital\n    to high-impact solutions in the renewables sector. This includes strict emissions standards as part\n    of green taxonomies to guide a capital shift away from fossil fuels and accelerate the development\n    of a green hydrogen sector.\nParticipate in platforms for knowledge-sharing and exchange on renewable energy research,\n    innovation and best practices across policy areas including auction design and corporate\n    procurement. Technology exchange and harmonised standards can also build the resilience of\n    the global renewable energy supply chain by achieving cost efficiencies, supporting best-in-class\n    asset development and lowering barriers to market.\nIntensify co-operation with neighbouring governments and grid authorities on regional grid\n    planning and opportunities for building interconnections, cross-border power trading, regional\n    power pools and innovative approaches like meshed grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario in the World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 shows, global energy-related\nCO2 emissions will need to be reduced significantly by 2030 to keep the Paris Agreement climate target\nwithin reach. This reduction will require a step change in action on both the supply and demand sides\nacross the entire energy system.\nTotal global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. This will\nneed to be complemented by a phase-down in fossil fuel generation, physical infrastructure upgrades,\nmodernisation and expansion, as well as enhanced grid flexibility.\nOn the demand side, energy efficiency improvements will be key. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This will not only require technological solutions but also behavioural\nchanges, necessitating greater awareness and broad support from communities and individuals for the\nenergy transition.\nThe twin goals of tripling renewable power and doubling energy efficiency by the end of this decade\nare undoubtedly challenging; but they are achievable. Their realisation requires urgent action by all\nstakeholders – governments (national, regional and local), international organisations, industry,\nfinance institutions and energy end-users (from big industrial users to individual households). The\nsooner we act, the sooner we will unlock the net economic, environmental and socio-economic benefits\nof an energy transition pathway that is consistent with the Paris Agreement goals.\n\nThis report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. They also need to make sure that the energy transition fosters socio-economic\nbenefits and minimises adverse environmental impacts. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth. Enhanced international collaboration can help facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building, as well as mobilise additional funding.\nThe current pace of action falls far short of that required to meet the 1.5°C target. COP28 provides a\nclear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit\nto tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target. Now is\nthe time for an ambitious new pledge that safeguards the wellbeing of our planet and enables the\nequitable distribution of the benefits of the energy transition among all peoples, nations and regions\nof the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nReferences\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPR (2021), Managing a fair transition away from coal in India, Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi, www.cprindia.org/managing-fair-transition-away-coal-india\n\nDunbar, M.

In IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario this will be driven by a combination\nof efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. These\nvital milestones must be achieved to keep the global energy transition on track\nto meet Paris Agreement goals.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF POLICIES IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THESE\nAMBITIOUS TARGETS. Aside from deployment and enabling policies, structural\nchange is needed to ensure the transition to an energy-efficient economy and a\nrenewables-based power system is just and fair, and provides benefits for all.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES ENABLING MEASURES THAT GO BEYOND\nREGULATIONS OR FISCAL AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. The organisational structures of power\nsectors must be reshaped to integrate a higher share of renewables. Procurement mechanisms\nmust be designed in a way that strengthens value chains and trade, and industrial policies must\nbe fit for building resilient supply chains. Education, training, re-skilling and up-skilling should\nbe prioritised; women and under-represented groups must be empowered; and collaboration\nbetween industry, civil society, policy makers and other key stakeholders should be encouraged.\n\nEXISTING ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE EXPANDED AND MODERNISED TO\nCREATE A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM FIT FOR RENEWABLES. There is an urgent need to boost crosssector infrastructure planning, increase cross-border co-operation and develop regional power\ngrids. Action is also needed to drive grid modernisation and expansion and ensure supply-side\nflexibility and demand-side management.\n\nRENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries.\n\nWE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. Annual average investment in renewable\npower generation must reach USD 1 300 billion by 2030, compared to 486 billion in 2022. In the\ndeveloping world, we must minimise investment risks and provide access to low-cost financing.\nThe global financial architecture must be reformed to support the energy transition in the Global\nSouth. Climate-related funding from multilateral development banks must be ramped up, and\npublic capital should be redirected from the fossil fuels sector to renewable energy.\n\nTHIS WILL REQUIRE STRONG INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. Immediate efforts are\nrequired to facilitate and contribute to multilateral initiatives that promote knowledge sharing\nand capacity building to deliver a just transition whilst also safeguarding nature and biodiversity.\nCollaboration is urgently required to foster collective action on governance, climate finance and\ninnovation. North-South and South-South dialogues should be cultivated; groups like the G7 and\nG20 must mobilise support and investment; and just transition funds should be established and\noperationalised in emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its\nlatest Assessment Report (AR6), sent a clear message to the world that this\ndecade is critical to our success in limiting global surface temperature increase\nto 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (IPCC, 2023).\nThere is an urgent need for rapid and immediate action to reduce global net\nanthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by almost 50% from 2019 levels\nby 2030, with a significant proportion of this reduction occurring within the field\nof energy.\n\nHowever, the energy transition remains off-track and global greenhouse gas\nemissions have reached record levels. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels.\nThis is far below the emission reductions required to place the world on a 1.5°C\npathway. The message is clear: we cannot limit global surface temperature\nincrease to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century without\nrapid, sustained and concerted action.\n\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake (GST), through which policy\nmakers, industry, financial institutions, civil society and other stakeholders will\nreflect on the progress achieved in implementing climate pledges since the\nadoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Leveraging low-cost solar PV, onshore and offshore wind, and\nother renewable electricity generation sources, the power sector must lead the way as solutions in other\nsectors scale up. Accelerating the progress of the transition worldwide requires a holistic approach,\nbacked by systemic innovation to transform existing structures and systems built for the fossil fuel era.\n\nWhilst the phase down of fossil fuels is both essential and inevitable, it must also be responsible. The\ntransition needs to be delivered in a way that ensures energy security, accessibility and affordability,\nwhile also sustaining socio-economic development and adopting nature-positive approaches. The\nspeed at which the transition is achieved will be determined by how quickly zero-carbon alternatives can\nbe introduced and scaled up.\n\nGreater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030.\nThese goals represent some of the most important levers for change to advance the energy transition\nthis decade.\n\nThis report consolidates high-level analysis of these targets, detailing existing shortfalls and identifying\nkey enablers to resolve them. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets.\n\nThe solutions presented are technologically mature, cost-competitive and commercially available, and can\nbe scaled up rapidly in most countries around the world; indeed, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind\nare already the most cost-competitive sources of new electricity supply in most countries today (IRENA,\n2023b). Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices.\nIt would also improve air quality and reduce health costs; deliver universal access to clean affordable\nenergy; and provide greater collective security and well-being. With the right policies in place, the global\nenergy transition will also bring extensive socio-economic benefits, including in the form of job creation\nand income generation.\n\nThe key enabling frameworks, policies and recommendations detailed in this report provide concrete\nadvice to governments around the world on the necessary steps required between now and 2030 to meet\nthese targets. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIt is essential that global leaders convening at COP28 demonstrate the collective will to set a new pace for\naction this decade by committing to these targets; in short, this is a critical step in a critical decade to keep\nthe 1.5°C target within reach. This will require accelerated actions in many areas, in particular modernising\nand expanding physical energy infrastructure; improving power system operations; establishing the\nright policies and regulatory frameworks; building resilient supply chains; and developing skills and\ninstitutional capacities. These actions must be underpinned by a significant increase in public and private\nfinancing, particularly to support the developing world.\n\nTo ensure the energy transition is both just and inclusive, greater international\ncollaboration is also needed. Worldwide, around 675 million people still lack access\nto electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking methods (IEA et al., 2023).\nProviding renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nForewords\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sultan Al Jaber\n            COP28 President-Designate\nTripling the deployment of renewable power generation and doubling\n            energy efficiency are amongst the most important levers to cut greenhouse\n            gas emissions.\nThe world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow.\nThe Global Stocktake has told us exactly how far off track we are. We need\n            to cut 22 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases in the next 7 years in order to\n            keep 1.5°C within reach.\nThe phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable and essential, but it must be\n            responsible. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy. Now is the time to turbocharge solutions and meet the\n            urgency of the moment with ambitious and determined action.\nAhead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in\n            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and\n            double energy efficiency.\nThis report outlines actionable solutions that can enable the progress we\n            need and demonstrates that this target is ambitious but achievable.\nI am now calling on everyone to come together, commit to common targets,\n            and take comprehensive domestic and international action, as outlined in\n            this report, to make our ambitions a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco La Camera\n            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency\nOur mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,\n            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency\n            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the\n            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is\n            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action.\nA significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with\n            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is\n            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris\n            Agreement. This will require concerted action to urgently address deeply\n            entrenched systemic barriers across infrastructure, policy and institutional\n            capacities stemming from systems and structures created for the fossil\u0002-fuel era.\nWe must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing\n            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;\n            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted\n            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and\n            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and\n            capabilities match the energy system of the future. This is especially\n            important for developing countries, where we must deliver on our\n            commitments to sustainable development, ensuring no one is left behind.\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake, in which the world\n            reflects on its progress in implementing the Paris Agreement. It is vital that\n            collective action be galvanised following this key milestone in our journey\n            toward a climate-safe existence to ensure the forthcoming round of\n            Nationally Determined Contributions in 2025 represents a transformative\n            leap forward, realigning us with the 1.5°C goal. This report outlines the\n            essential actions governments must prioritise to achieve this objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Douglas\n            Chief Executive Officer, Global Renewables Alliance\nThis is the ‘make or break’ decade to avoid the most catastrophic impacts\n            of climate change. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future.\n            \nDouble down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This\n            would deliver cleaner electricity systems, access to affordable energy and\n            green jobs for millions of people, billions of dollars in public and private\n            capital to foster climate-resilient growth, and reduce loss and damage for\n            nature and people wrought by harmful climate change.\n            \nTo achieve these targets, we need to dramatically ramp up wind power,\n            solar power, hydropower and geothermal power. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. On average, 1 000 GW\n            of renewables needs to be installed each year for the rest of the decade to\n            bring total renewables capacity to 11 000 GW by 2030. As the growth curve\n            will rise over the course of the decade, the renewables industry believes\n            at least 1 500 GW of renewables capacity could be installed in 2030 alone.\n            \nGlobal leaders must commit to these targets at COP28. However, progress\n            towards 2030 goals cannot be taken for granted. Policy makers must\n            work hand-in-hand with industry and civil society to urgently implement\n            the enabling actions in this report, centred on: infrastructure and system\n            operation; policy and regulation; and supply chains, skills and capacities.\n            Critically, these areas must be reinforced by low-cost financing and\n            international collaboration.\n            \nThis is a unique “once in a generation” opportunity, but we need urgent\n            action to scale renewable energy in every region of the world. Only then\n            can we protect the planet and secure a liveable future for all.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPreface\r\n \n\n\n\n\nSince the Rio Earth Summit and the adoption of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, the\nConference of the Parties to the Convention (COP) has convened\nsignatory Parties each year to determine ambitions and responsibilities,\nand identify and assess the progress of climate measures. The 21st\nsession of the COP (COP21) led to the Paris Agreement, which mobilised\ncollective action to limit the increase in global average temperature\nto well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, pursue efforts to limit\nthe temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and\nstrengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.\n\nCOP28, and the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement, can\nbe the turning point on climate action over this critical decade to\naccelerate a transition that puts economies on the path toward a new\nlow-carbon, high-growth, sustainable economic model in a way that\nis both transformational and just. COP28 has the vision to deliver on\nthe pillars of the Paris Agreement, focusing on specific action on four\nparadigm shifts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nfast-tracking the energy transition and slashing emissions before 2030;\ntransforming climate finance, by delivering on old promises and\n    setting the framework for a new deal on finance;\nputting nature, people, lives and livelihoods at the heart of climate\n    action; and\nmobilising for the most inclusive COP ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nDisclaimer and acknowledgements\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThis publication and the material herein are provided “as is”.

According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario identifies a technically and economically feasible pathway to an energy future that\nis consistent with Paris Agreement goals. It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system.\n\nDespite the progress achieved to date, the current deployment of energy transition technologies is\ninsufficient in speed and scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions.\n\nBy 2030, global total installed renewable power generation capacity would need to expand more than\nthree-fold, from 3 382 GW in 2022 to 11 174 GW, according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Specifically,\ninstalled solar PV capacity would rise to more than 5 400 GW, from 1 055 GW in 2022, and wind installations\nwould surpass 3 500 GW (3 040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore), up from 899 GW in 2022, over the\nsame period (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c). The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. After solar PV and\nwind power, the third-largest increase in generation capacity would be in hydropower; by 2030, global\ninstalled hydropower capacity (excluding pumped hydro) would grow by almost 17% from the 2022 level,\nreaching 1 465 GW under the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario.\n\n\nFIGURE 1 Key performance indicators for achieving the 1.5°C Scenario in the Decade for Action\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c).\n\n\nThis suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Energy storage capacity would expand in tandem, with\ncumulative global battery storage increasing by a factor of 21, from 17 GW in 2020 to 359 GW in 2030\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRenewable power additions this decade may not be linear, however, with many factors impacting the\nrate of growth. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Some projections of solar growth foresee that 1 000 GW of annual solar PV installations\nalone may be reached as soon as 2028 (Haegel et al., 2023). To meet the tripling renewable power target,\nannual renewable additions need to ramp up as fast as possible, and as early as possible, in this decade.\n\nCountries and regions will follow different trajectories in accelerating the deployment of renewable\npower capacity. Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. This will allow them to assist others by sharing\nlessons learnt, technological and technical know-how, and experiences in establishing the right\nconditions for the scaling up of renewables.\n\nUnder the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario, the global solar PV market would be dominated by G20 countries; but\noutside this group, cumulative capacity will need to surpass 900 GW by 2030, while the cumulative capacity\nin G20 countries would reach approximately 4 530 GW. For wind, China, the United States, Canada, Brazil\nand several European countries have high onshore wind potential, while the majority of expansions in\noffshore wind would be in four key markets (China, EU-27, the United States and India), accounting for\nmore than 60% of offshore wind deployment by 2030. For hydropower, G20 countries together would\naccount for 79% (over 1 150 GW) of global hydropower capacity by 2030, with almost 305 GW of total\ncapacity spread across the rest of the world.\n\nFIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. Bioenergy includes biogas, biomass\nwaste and biomass solid.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nIt is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022).\n\nAccelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nIn 2010, the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of onshore wind was\nUSD 0.107/kilowatt hour (kWh) – 95% higher than the lowest fossil fuel cost of USD 0.056/kWh. Yet,\nby 2022, the global weighted average LCOE of new onshore wind projects was USD 0.033/kWh – 52%\nlower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option, at USD 0.069/kWh (Figure 3).\n\nThis improvement was surpassed by that of solar PV, however. In 2010, solar PV had a global weighted\naverage LCOE of USD 0.445/kWh – 710% more expensive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option; but\nby 2022, a spectacular decline in costs – to USD 0.049/kWh – made solar PV’s global weighted average\nLCOE 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nFIGURE 3 Cost competitiveness of solar and wind power, 2010-2022\n\nNote: LCOE = levelised cost of electricity.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nThe global weighted-average LCOE of offshore wind fell from being 258% more expensive than the cheapest\nfossil fuel option in 2010 to being just 17% more expensive in 2022, with costs falling from USD 0.197/kWh\nto USD 0.081/kWh. Concentrated solar power (CSP) saw its global weighted average LCOE fall from 591%\nhigher than the cheapest fossil fuel option in 2010 to 71% higher in 2022 (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nWhile hydropower’s global weighted average LCOE increased in 2021-2022 to USD 0.061/kWh – largely\nowing to the development of more challenging and remote sites – it remains cheaper than new\nfossil-fuel fired options. This is also true for geothermal projects, with a global weighted-average LCOE\nof USD 0.056/kWh in 2022, as well as for bioenergy projects, at USD 0.061/kWh (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nIt is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. 2 As 2022\nshowed, the indirect economic benefits of this enhanced energy security can be significant; yet they are\ntypically not valued in current policy.\n\nFIGURE 4 Investments required to meet the 1.5°C goal\n\nSource: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nSimilarly, the economic benefits of reducing pollution, and thereby improving climate, environmental and\nhealth outcomes, are almost never properly valued in policy-setting (IRENA, 2023b). These unpriced\nbenefits significantly improve the competitiveness of renewable power and make the business case for\naccelerated deployment even more compelling.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. This represents a transformative shift in power system\nsupply dynamics and poses new challenges to power system operations. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies.\n\nIn recent years, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity – known as ‘green hydrogen’ – and its\nderivatives have been identified as industrial feedstocks for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors.\nHydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. These measures can often generate\neconomic and environmental co-benefits. A range of measures will be needed across all end-use sectors,\nincluding modal shifts from private passenger cars to collective transport, and from passenger aviation\nand road-based freight to rail, as well as the adoption of circular economy principles, improved building\ninsulation, heat pumps and efficient electric motors – especially for industrial end-use sectors.\n\nEnergy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification.\nThe electrification of end-use sectors – such as in transport and buildings – would see a rise in direct use\nof electricity in total final energy consumption from 22% in 2020 to 29% in 2030.\n\nTechnical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nTo align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). If this rate is achieved, global final energy consumption would experience\nminimal growth over the same period.\n\nWith renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made.\n\nFIGURE 5 Energy intensity: Indicators in transport and buildings in 2030\n Based on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants.\nThis will require enhancements to – and expansion of – current power\ngrid systems, and the modernisation and upgrading of power system\noperations.\n\nWith VRE sources becoming the major source of power in a\n1.5°C-compatible world, countries must start upgrading and\nexpanding their power grid infrastructure to prepare for increasing\nend-use sector electrification. Multiple measures are required,\nincluding:\n\n\nInnovative power planning, grid expansion, modernisation and\n    enhancement, and addressing interconnection backlogs (projects\n    awaiting connection to the grid).\n    \nChanges in grid operation and management, potentially also\n    including new market design.\n    \nIncreased interconnectors between countries and regions.\n    \nGrowth in electricity storage; comprising short-duration storage\n    for increasing grid flexibility and long-duration storage to enhance\n    energy security (e.g. pumped storage).\n    \nMeasures to allow greater integration of demand-side management\n    and behind-the-meter (consumer) flexibility options (e.g. distributed\n    storage).\n    \nIntroducing other flexibility sources (e.g. green hydrogen, hybrid\n    renewable parks combining wind/solar/storage, etc.).\n    \n\n\nFIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). 4  With clarity on grid infrastructure development\nplans and reasonable guarantees on connection availability, investors will feel more confident building\nnew generation; meanwhile, consumers would be more likely to invest in electrification when a reliable\nsupply of low-cost electricity can be made available.\n\nWhen integrating higher shares of locally available variable solar and wind power, power systems will\nalso need to innovate to become: increasingly decentralised, allowing electricity to be generated at\nlocations closer to demand; and bi-directional, allowing electricity from distributed power generating\nfacilities to be injected into the grid.\n\nModernised, smarter grids are required; in the European Union (EU), around 30% of the envisaged\ninvestment in grids by 2030 could be earmarked for digitalisation 5  (European Commission, 2022).\nThey will also need to be larger and more robust. Hence, grid costs are expected to increase over time\n(IRENA, 2023a). This will require fast-tracked permitting to ensure timely investments in modern grids.\nAdding more widely distributed power generation sources will also bring resilience, especially against\nincreasingly intense extreme weather events owing to climate change (IPCC, 2023).\n\nThe electrification of transport also requires significant investments in enabling infrastructure. Electric\nvehicles will potentially account for more than 80% of all road transport activity by 2050; with 359 million\nelectric and plug-in hybrid light passenger vehicles worldwide by 2030 and 2 182 million by 2050 (IRENA,\n2023a); yet their market entry will be contingent upon coordinated investments in charging infrastructure\nand power grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure planning, timelines and assessments of investment needs for grids are aligned with long-term targets for renewable energy buildout and end-use sector decarbonisation, e.g. transport.\nMobilise funds for long-term grid investment; channel donor finance to building capacity and\n    infrastructure for integrating renewables; and streamline permitting procedures for new grid\n    infrastructure and upgrades to existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.\nDevelop modernised, decentralised (where suitable) and more resilient grid systems using\n    digitalisation, smart applications for demand-side management and interconnections with\n    neighbouring grid systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur.\nHistorically, this has been provided by pumped storage and hydropower with reservoirs.\nHowever, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). All of these technologies are undergoing rapid\ninnovation.\n\nFIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. saving energy from spring days with low loads and abundant solar to deploy\nduring high load days in the summer; or from windy autumn days to deploy during high load cloudy winter\ndays). Diverse storage technologies enhance the resilience of grids that are subject to extreme weather\nfor prolonged periods, help relieve grid congestion, provide transmission services and shore up local\narea reliability.\n\nLDES, including storage technologies spanning 10+, 24+, 100+ and 150+ hours in duration and providing\nboth power and heat, is also able to provide other grid services including black start (restarting parts\nof the grid where power has been lost in a blackout) and micro-grid level assistance for areas or key\ninfrastructure that may lose power. Storage durations can span weeks or months in the case of pumped\nstorage and reservoir hydropower. As the largest form of installed flexibility at over 175 GW worldwide,\npumped storage hydropower can play an important role in providing LDES and vital grid services, with\nsubstantial potential for off-river pumped storage to be developed in the coming decades (IHA, 2023).\nSome LDES technologies are commercially available today, while others are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Numerous companies are signing contracts (e.g. with utilities, airports, data centres,\nindustrial users, etc.) and are deploying LDES at grid-scale quantities, and pumped storage has been\nsuccessfully deployed for decades.\n\nOne emerging LDES technology is hydrogen storage. Hydrogen’s true competitive strength lies in its\nunique ability to store energy for long periods of time in large quantities. As green hydrogen displaces\nfossil fuels in some end uses, hydrogen storage could become increasingly critical to energy security,\nin the same way that natural gas storage is today in many regions. Hydrogen storage will be needed\nprimarily to meet variation in supply (rather than demand), as green hydrogen is created using VRE\nsources. Long-term hydrogen storage can play an important role in strengthening energy security and\nsystem resilience (IRENA, 2023d). Support for the continued development of these technologies is\ncritical for decarbonisation.\n\nIn many places, however, legacy market arrangements and policy frameworks do not incentivise\ninvestment in storage at scale. Action from policy makers can drive progress in this sector, such as:\nassessing energy storage and flexibility needs; setting LDES mandates for medium- and long-term\ncapacity targets; updating criteria for marketplaces; providing innovation grants and subsidies for prefeasibility studies; and establishing public-private partnerships.\n\nOther market innovations can also foster a healthy storage market, such as the introduction of congestion\nmanagement trading platforms, ancillary services markets to support the grid, and awarding additional\nvalue for features such as flexibility in capacity payments and capability to provide peaking power\n(e.g. storage technologies that can replace a natural gas peaking plant should be reflected in system\nmodelling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConduct technical assessments of system decarbonisation needs and timelines, and ensure the\n    planned buildout of renewables is complemented by storage resources of varying duration, as\n    well as other sources of flexibility.\nCollaborate with regulators and the renewables sector to enhance power market planning and\n    ensure price signals, clear targets and procurement incentivise longer duration storage.\nEncourage investment and innovation in diverse storage technologies to suit different users, such\n    as by establishing research, development and innovation (RDI) grant programmes, encouraging\n    public–private partnerships and setting medium- and long-term capacity targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-use electrification and sector coupling\nWith solar and wind power scaling up rapidly in this decade, electrification has become a vital\ndecarbonisation pathway. Green hydrogen and its derivatives, produced by electrolysers using low-cost\nrenewable power, can be used to decarbonise end-use sectors that are difficult to electrify directly –\nsuch as iron and steel making, and shipping – and to provide seasonal energy storage solutions.\n\nHowever, electrification needs to be accelerated by systemic innovation, making it not only faster but\nsmarter. Smart electrification – through sector coupling and enhanced flexibility – prevents a higher peak\nelectricity load on the power system. It also enables the power system to accommodate new loads while\nallowing integration of a higher share of variable renewable electricity in a cost-efficient manner. This\ncan help sustain renewables-based electrification without jeopardising energy system operation, thus\nmaking the power system robust and resilient. To harness all these benefits, systemic innovation should\ninvolve the entire energy value chain across four key dimensions: technology and infrastructure; market\ndesign and regulation; system planning and operation; and business models (IRENA, 2023d). Smart\ncharging for electric vehicles is a good example in this regard.\n\nSector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nThe benefit of this will be smarter, more intelligent demand-side management, achieved by deploying\nmore advanced digital technologies both behind-the-meter (by energy consumers) and in power\nsystems. Demand response would become more agile and inter-operational through sector-coupled\ntechnologies such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to smart charging\nfacilities. This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nEnd-use electrification, sector-coupling and the rapid scale-up of variable renewable electricity all\nrequire integrated cross-sectoral infrastructure planning – a process for optimising the co-development\nof increasingly connected infrastructure in various sectors. 7 The European Hotmaps project offers an\nopen-source toolbox to support public authorities, energy agencies and urban planners as they plan\nheating and cooling at local, regional and national levels. It allows users to map cooling and heating\ndemand, as well as supply, in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom, and provides renewable\nenergy generation and industrial waste heat potentials (Hotmaps, 2021). This facilitates the integration\nof heating and cooling with waste-to-energy and renewable energy, including power-to-heat. However,\nthis planning approach requires incentives for infrastructure investments where market barriers exist,\ngiven that different infrastructures operate under different legislative, regulatory and policy regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt a sector-coupling approach to the decarbonisation of economies by pursuing smart\n    electrification of the transport, buildings and industry sectors.\nCreate fora for co-ordinated planning among relevant authorities on infrastructure development,\n    including renewable energy projects, grid and transmission assets, electric vehicle charging\n    infrastructure and heat networks.\nIntroduce economic incentives for smart electrification and demand-side response (such as tax\n    credits and innovation grants) to encourage private investment in sector-coupling solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand-side management\nElectricity systems are complex; in addition to the grid infrastructure planning required to unlock the\nbenefits of sector coupling, distributed grid planning and operations will need well-defined energy\nmanagement schemes on both sides of the end-user meter. These schemes apply to both the supply side\n(power management) and demand side (load management).\nDemand-side management (DSM) comprises a set of strategies traditionally aimed at reducing peak\ndemand, which will be increasingly needed to incentivise consumption in periods of high VRE generation.\nDSM addresses various challenges, including VRE integration, rising electricity costs and environmental\nimpacts. For example, DSM can employ time-of-use pricing to encourage customers to shift electricity\nusage to off-peak hours, while demand response programmes can financially reward customers for\nreducing electricity usage during peak hours or consuming electricity during high VRE generation\nperiods. Critical-peak pricing, real-time pricing and critical-peak rebates are also among the strategies\navailable. These approaches are crucial for optimising energy efficiency in both residential and industrial\nbuildings.\nAs the transition advances, DSM will also provide flexibility to alleviate the need for more costly\nrequirements. Several challenges persist, however – particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, and other Global South regions. Notable issues include physical grid and digital technology\ninfrastructure gaps, as well as complex and inconsistent regulations and policies. Financing challenges\nalso hinder progress; attracting investment in clean energy enablers like DSM solutions requires\ninnovative financing models and incentives.\nIntelligent load control, demand response and energy efficiency are pivotal in enabling a secure and\nresilient renewables-based power system. Continued investment and innovation in these areas will\nfurther drive the adaptation of demand to supply in a renewable energy-driven future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAssess the cost-benefit of investment in DSM programmes, accounting for the energy and cost\n    savings it can provide instead of investing in grid infrastructure expansion.\nEnsure grid planning prioritises modernisation and DSM technology to close critical technology\n    gaps as infrastructure expands. Developing economies can explore innovative financing models –\n    such as blended finance – to mobilise investment in grid and DSM solutions.\nImprove data availability within the wider electricity system to enable innovation in DSM and\n    access to applications like smart meters by consumers and third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nGovernments have a crucial role to play in tripling renewable power capacity and placing the world on a\n1.5°C pathway. All too often, the energy transition discourse relegates governments’ responsibilities to\ncreating an enabling environment for private investments through predictable and stable policies, and\nthe creation of instruments that de-risk investment projects. Although this is crucial, a much broader and\nmore integrated policy approach is required to facilitate the adoption of an entire spectrum of energy\ntransition solutions needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and unlock its socio-economic benefits (Figure 8).\n\nGovernments need to be far more engaged in shaping and guiding the energy transition, including through\npolicies for ambitious public investment programmes and sufficient forward-planning for renewables\nscale-up, system integration and grid build-out.\n\nCross-cutting approaches covering all renewable technologies, electrification technologies and others\nare needed to facilitate the energy transition (e.g. energy storage), include enabling policies that set\nambitions and send clear signals to stakeholders, eliminate distortions, incentivise the uptake of solutions\nand facilitate access to affordable financing. They also include policies that ensure the integration of\nrenewables within energy systems, economies, nature and societies, as well as specific deployment\npolicies for various technologies. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand.\n\nTransitioning to a renewables-based economy may also bring challenges in the form of financing gaps,\nlabour market disruptions and energy sector insecurity. These misalignments, if not well-managed,\nrisk inequitable outcomes and a slower pace of the energy transition. Therefore, a set of structural and\njust transition policies, along with the creation of strong institutions to ensure policy co-ordination and\ncohesion, is required to manage potential misalignments.\n\nFinally, a holistic global policy framework that entails international collaboration including North-South\nand South-South co-operation is needed to bring stakeholders from countries around the world together\nto commit to a just transition that leaves no one behind and strengthens international finance flows,\ncapacities and technologies in an equitable manner.\n\nThis section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nFIGURE 8 The IRENA holistic policy framework for a just and inclusive energy transition\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2021b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Enhanced energy efficiency is a crucial enabler for making high\nlevels of end-use electrification feasible and affordable. Measures related to reducing energy demand\nand improving efficiency are needed across all end-use sectors.\n\nMinimum energy performance standards (MEPS) can support industrial, commercial and residential\nusers to procure and switch to more energy efficient appliances or equipment such as electric heating/\ncooling technologies. Building codes can set energy performance requirements by specifying insulation\nstandards, thereby reducing heating and cooling demands. They can also specify greenhouse gas\nemission targets and carbon footprints. For renovation, in particular, codes can be coupled with financial\nincentives.\n\nIt is also important to address prevailing challenges associated with building ownership structures,\nequitable access and benefit-sharing of energy efficiency investments and policies. “Green loans” could\ncarry lower interest rates and protect low-income energy consumers from energy price fluctuations\nand inflationary environments. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.\n\nIn the transport sector, significant improvements can be achieved by promoting energy efficient mobility\n(e.g. public transport such as railways, metros and buses, and car-sharing), as well as active (nonmotorised) transport such as cycling and walking in urban areas. Public campaigns can be undertaken by\nnational and local governments to encourage green mobility modes. Other policies, such as differentiated\nparking fees and highway tolls, can encourage a shift to public transport, complemented by dedicated\ndriving lanes for car-sharing. Public transportation fleets also offer the opportunity to utilise costcompetitive renewable fuels or electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement with specific time horizons and outline\n    clear avenues for implementation.\n    \nStrengthen regulatory frameworks, including building codes that specify low energy performance\n    and appliance energy efficiency standards.\n    \nExpand the availability of financial incentives and affordable lending schemes for meeting\n    standards on energy efficiency, such as tax credits or green loans with favourable interest rates\n    for building renovation or modernisation.\n    \nEstablish public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy efficiency measures, public\n    transport and green mobility for cost savings and collective decarbonisation goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket incentives and fiscal policy\nWhile renewables have become increasingly competitive, they still face barriers compared to fossil fuels.\nRising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective. The choice of instrument and its design should consider: the nature of the solution\n(e.g. utility-scale, distributed, off-grid); level of development of the sector; power system organisational\nstructure; wider macroeconomic environment (e.g. impact of inflation and commodity price volatility);\nand broader policy objectives. It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below). This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk. A mechanism to allow for bilateral power\nprocurement between generators and private off-takers (such as industrial actors or corporates) can\nfurther strengthen the case for large deployment volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments.\n    \nIntroduce tax credits, levies and/or exemptions on import/export duties for key materials and\n    components in the renewable energy supply chain.\n    \nEnsure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains.\n    \nConsider the trade-offs between ‘lowest-price’ objectives, and other policy outcomes such as\n    socio-economic development, system integration and industry sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower market design and regulation\nThe world is entering a new era in which electricity systems will be increasingly dominated by zeromarginal-cost renewable technologies. Power markets must evolve and adapt to new market forces,\nsuch as corporate and industrial demand, and behind-the-meter (prosumer) generation. They must be\norganised in a way that incentivises new investment in renewable power generation and the flexibility to\nprovide reliable electricity at a level required for the 1.5°C pathway. This requires governments and other\nstakeholders to undertake a close examination of their power systems’ organisational structures, i.e. the\ninstitutions, processes and arrangements through which electricity services are exchanged and rewarded.\n\nWholesale power markets today are based on marginal cost pricing, where the most expensive\ngenerator (with the highest variable cost – typically fossil fuel-fired plants) determines electricity\nprices for the time period in which the market operates. This poses a number of challenges. As the\nshare of renewable power grows, wholesale spot markets will see increased price volatility, as periods\nof high renewable power generation push clearing prices in the wholesale market close to zero. When\nrenewable generation is less than demand, flexibility resources will be needed, potentially resulting in\nvery high prices at certain times.\n\nIf wholesale markets are the main source of revenue, the economic feasibility of new investments will\nplummet, as even existing generators will struggle to recover their initial capital costs whilst prospective\ninvestors realise diminishing returns. The paradigm that relies on free markets to incentivise power\nsupply investment decisions therefore needs to change.\n\nUltimately, a renewables-based power system requires enhanced flexibility; wholesale market design\nmust deliver this as well as providing the volume of renewable power needed. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.\n\nPower system organisational structures must evolve to better align with energy policy and\ndecarbonisation goals. A “dual procurement” power market design could introduce long-term\ncontract mechanisms (e.g. Auctions, CfDs, PPAs) as the backbone of renewable power procurement,\nalongside a short-term market to dispatch flexible resources in an affordable way (IRENA, 2022a).\nThis holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system.\n\nThis transformation is partially underway, as auctions are becoming the preferred tool to procure\nrenewable energy, and wholesale markets are becoming more time and location granular (IRENA,\n2023a); but there are meaningful actions authorities can take now to ensure the acceleration of this trend.\n\nOne way to achieve enhanced system flexibility is for power markets to allow flexibility technologies\n(such as batteries and pumped hydropower) to provide ancillary services and be rewarded accordingly.\nAncillary services that serve to stabilise the grid network and will become increasingly important as\ndispatchable fossil fuel-based generation is phased out of the power mix. Today, many power systems\nreward the provision of energy but not ancillary services (where these services are not included in\ncontractual obligations). They therefore need to be appropriately valued and reflected in power system\ndesign. Valuing, pricing and procuring ancillary services astutely can bring new players to the grid, with\nadvantages for the whole power system. Examples of this include the enhanced frequency regulation\nauctions in the UK.\n\nTo achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This includes growth in distributed renewable energy\ngeneration systems – notably using solar PV – but also community solar and wind projects. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. Such measures can maximise the socio-economic benefits of renewable energy, insulate consumers from price volatility, create local supply\nchains and job opportunities, and enhance public perceptions of renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors.\nDesign auctions that balance competitive price discovery and long-term delivery of affordable\n    electricity. Auctions should also be run for sufficiently large and ambitious volumes, with\n    consistent, transparent tendering schedules to effectively foster competitive bidding.\nCreate a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix.\nRethink participation rules to allow new technologies to engage in the power market as flexibility\n    providers, including storage and demand side aggregators.\nEncourage investment in distributed renewable energy systems that allow consumers to become\n    “prosumers” by both using and producing clean electricity.\nReorganise power market structures to ensure policies for accelerating renewables deployment\n    account for system flexibility as well as sustainable returns to generators and investors.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamlining permitting\nThe time and cost constraints imposed by permitting procedures represent a major bottleneck\nimpacting the deployment of renewable energy projects in many countries. It is essential that permitting\nprocedures are fit-for-purpose and keep pace with renewable and climate targets, without compromising\nenvironmental and social impact standards. Experiences from the public and private sectors indicate\nthat best practices in permitting centre on four areas: administrative consolidation; digitalisation; policy\nsupport; and public engagement (European Commission, 2023).\n\nRenewable energy developers often need to consult numerous authorities at national, sub-national and\nsometimes village or prefecture level for the necessary permits to build a project. This process can be\nlengthy and extremely bureaucratic; for instance, the global average time required for permitting an\noffshore wind project is nine years. Onshore wind and utility-scale PV permitting processes can also\nbe long, although they are typically shorter than those for offshore wind. Similar obstacles exist for\nhydropower projects and smaller scale distributed projects for end consumers using renewable energy\ntechnologies like rooftop solar.\n\nCreating dedicated, centralised authorities is one way to streamline this process by ensuring developers\ncan refer to a single focal point. Countries like Denmark and the Philippines have already adopted a “one-stop shop” model to accelerate renewables deployment, but this model only works if it is adequately\nresourced. In addition, digitalised processes to submit and track applications would enable developments\nto progress more efficiently, while access to digitised local consenting and historical dispute records\nwould allow developers and authorities to screen sites that could be high-risk or unsuitable at an early\nstage (IRENA, 2023h).\n\nAn overarching best practice is the introduction of legislation mandating a maximum lead time for the\npermitting of renewable energy projects. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. Gaining social acceptance through\npublic engagement with relevant stakeholders is critical in the consenting and constructing stages of a\nrenewable energy project. This includes early and continuous consultation by authorities and developers\nwith local communities to communicate the benefits and considerations brought by a project to the area,\nas well as a transparent conflict resolution mechanism that sincerely addresses community concerns.\n\nComprehensive and efficient permitting frameworks represent a clear win-win, allowing renewable\nenergy development to expand this decade while cultivating acceptance with other interests in land and\nsea spaces. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023).\n\nRecent studies indicate that adopting best practices in permitting could cut consenting time for utility-scale wind and solar projects by more than half; for example, onshore wind farms could be permitted in\none year, offshore wind farms in 1.5 years and solar farms in as little as three months (ETC, 2023). This\nmakes permitting a high-impact enabler for the energy transition, where the necessary investment in\nresource, policy support and capacity will bring enormous value to countries in accelerating renewables\ngrowth and securing associated socio-economic and environmental benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023).\n\nThe energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. If not well managed, these\nmisalignments risk inequitable outcomes, which could sow doubt among policy makers and the\npublic concerning the advantages of the transition and lead to a fractured and unco-ordinated policy\nenvironment. Hence, there is a need for policies and measures that equitably distribute the benefits of\nthe energy transition and raise public awareness about these positive impacts.\n\nIn terms of jobs, sectoral misalignments may arise due to potential shifts in value and supply chains\nduring the energy transition. For instance, transitioning from fossil fuel power generation to solar energy\nmay shift the focus from fuel extraction to the semi-conductor industry. The impact on employment\ndepends on factors such as domestic production and labour productivity. Labour-market interventions\nencompass adequate employment services attuned to evolving circumstances and needs, along with\nmeasures to facilitate labour mobility (IRENA and ILO, 2023).\n\nCommunity benefit schemes span countries from Costa Rica to Mali and adopt a range of structures,\nfrom shared ownership of renewable assets to industry sponsorship of critical social and economic\ninfrastructure in host communities (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2020). Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions.\n\nAligning policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition will facilitate local\nvalue creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, and on a larger scale, ensure political\nand social stability as renewable energy expands.\n\nAs part of a sensitive and efficient permitting framework, renewable development must be well integrated\nwith the principles of sustainability, circular economy and reduced environmental impact – particularly\non land use and biodiversity. This also applies to enabling infrastructure, with grid expansion into remote\nand biodiverse areas requiring careful siting.\n\nAdopting sustainable end-of-life management policies, including waste management legislation, can\nhelp countries prepare for the anticipated volumes of equipment waste such as solar PV panels and\nbatteries. Research and development programmes across the energy and waste sectors, and industrial\nclusters, can help to further scale waste management infrastructure on a national or regional basis\n(IRENA and IEA, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition and foster local\n    value creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, with a special focus on the\n    inclusion of marginalised groups.\nAnticipate labour market disruptions and establish programmes that can address workforce\n    gaps, minimise labour misalignments, create opportunities for targeted recruitment and labour\n    mobility, such as relocation grants, and establish social protection programmes.\nMinimise adverse environmental impacts and encourage nature-positive approaches, for example\n    by incentivising the uptake of sustainability standards for new renewable energy assets – such as\n    the Hydropower Sustainability Standard – as part of procurement schemes.\nEnsure the impacts of mining activities and the use of relatively scarce components are mitigated\n    through provisions for circular economy (end-of-life management, recycling and reuse of materials).\nGather information on renewables’ waste production through regular monitoring of waste\n    produced by technology, the composition of waste streams, installed system performance and the\n    causes and frequency of system failures, in order to adopt waste minimisation legislation suitable\n    for the pace and scale of the transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\r\n \n\n\n\n\nBuilding resilient supply chains\nThe vulnerabilities of key energy industries to logistics bottlenecks, commodity price volatility, trade\nbarriers, and commodity and component import dependencies have become increasingly apparent in\nrecent years. Energy supply chains have become a priority agenda for policy makers, as demand and\ncompetition for critical raw materials, rare earth elements and production capacity become more acute.\n\nWithout well-functioning and cost-efficient industrial supply chains, the energy transition will not\nmaterialise. If not well managed, competition, security and scarcity challenges in renewable energy\nsupply chains could lead to a disorderly transition, characterised by slower rates of renewables\ndeployment at inflated costs. A mismatch between supply and demand for several critical minerals is\nalready evident, with particularly high levels observed for lithium – a key material required for the shortduration energy storage and electric transport sectors (IRENA, 2023e). Bottlenecks for key components\nin the wind industry – e.g. nacelles, blades and gearboxes – are set to emerge by the second half of this\ndecade in Asia and the Americas (GWEC, 2023). High concentration risk in the global renewables supply\nchain also raises the prospect of price or security of supply uncertainty in the future.\n\nRobust and resilient global supply chains are required to support a 1.5°C pathway. The mining and\nprocessing of critical materials including lithium, copper, nickel and other rare earth metals are\nconstrained within specific geographies, exposing these supply chains to geopolitical tensions and\nconcentration risks (IRENA, 2023e). Policy makers should work with the private sector to identify\nproduction gaps and supply chain weaknesses on a national and regional basis, and generate strategies\nto reinforce supply chain security.\n\nSocially responsible procurement is another key issue, where many critical materials and components\nrefined or manufactured in one country are imported by others for use in the renewables sector. It will\nbe vital to ensure supply chains – in the mining and processing segments in particular – are managed\nwith respect to fair trade, and high environmental, social governance (ESG) and sustainability standards.\nResilient supply chains are also key to sustaining the cost-value proposition of renewable energy around\nthe world.\n\nAs countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. The need for local value creation and regional supply chain\ninvestment must be carefully balanced with reducing trade barriers for goods and services central to\nthe renewables renewables industry. This will be key to avoid intensifying supply chain bottlenecks\nand making renewables less cost-competitive, while maximising socio-economic benefits.\n\nMultilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. This will require governments to work with industry, civil society and other stakeholders to\nensure supply chain planning is conducted through a wider lens that encompasses national interests,\ncost-effective and socially responsible sourcing, long-term social and environmental sustainability, and\nclimate and renewable energy targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate with the renewables industry on industrial development reviews and plans for the\n    transition that are sustainable, achievable, and adequately mitigate risk of supply insecurity\n    and price volatility. Approaches include diversifying sources of production, anticipating critical\n    production gaps and localising value chains.\nEnsure socially responsible procurement of renewables by encouraging uptake of sustainable\n    supply chain assurance schemes, such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative.\nIncentivise public–private partnerships and investment in circularity to encourage reuse of\n    materials and a circular economy approach to project development, which can help to reduce\n    concentration risk and supply insecurity of critical materials.\nCo-operate with international fora and financial institutions to safeguard international trade\n    corridors for materials and components for key renewable energy technologies.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation, training and capacity-building\nBuilding a skilled energy transition workforce requires measures to both expand the talent pipeline and\nenhance the quality of education and training provisions.\n\nEarly exposure to renewable energy topics and careers is vital for sparking interest in pursuing a career in the\nsector, but also to increase social acceptance by a knowledgeable citizenry. The curricula at higher education\nand vocational training institutions must reflect the skills and competences required by the transition.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the content of education and training programmes, it is also important to\nenhance the instructional methods used. For example, experiential learning methods where students are\nencouraged to develop problem-solving strategies can help to prepare learners for jobs in the constantly\nevolving renewable energy sector, where independent knowledge-seeking will often be necessary.\n\nFacilitating collaboration between government agencies on workforce development, industry and\neducational institutions will contribute to more co-ordinated skill-matching efforts. It is vital to consider\nhow a just transition can respond to potential labour displacement in the existing energy sector workforce\nand re-skill or upskill appropriately.\n\nTargeted measures to train, recruit and retain women and other underrepresented or marginalised groups\n(including older workers, ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities and those on a low\nincome) will ensure the dividends of the transition are enjoyed by all. This inclusion can be implemented\nthrough early exposure to renewable energy leadership and career pathways, targeted scholarships,\ngovernment-funded training opportunities, and industry apprenticeship and mentorship schemes.\n\nOutside the renewables industry, it is equally important to ensure sufficiently skilled and trained workers\nare available in government departments concerned with international trade, supply chains, electric\ncharging infrastructure and land use. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government.\n\nCarefully designed public-private partnerships (PPPs) can also play a crucial role in improving overall\ntraining quality while meeting sectoral labour requirements, promoting national skill standards and\nmatchmaking communities with workplace training opportunities. In addition to improving training\ncontent, PPPs can also play a role in shifting the financing of training provisions to a more integrated\napproach that incorporates multiple funding mechanisms including payroll-based training levies, tax\nincentives, scholarships and donations, vouchers and student loans (Dunbar, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign workforce planning among all stakeholders, including labour agencies, labour unions, the\n    wider energy industry and educational institutions, to identify critical skill gaps and workforce\n    needs in advance, and to design skill-building strategies accordingly.\nProvide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition.\nEnsure energy transition goals are reflected in educational programmes and resources, such\n    as university curricula, vocational training institutions, occupational health and safety training\n    institutions, and professional education programmes.\nBuild the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce.\nInvest in reskilling and upskilling measures for vulnerable communities and those in fossil fuel\n    industries to ensure the employment benefits of the transition are extended to a wide subset of\n    the population. Such measures need to be embedded in broader regional economic revitalisation\n    programmes and investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). However, investments remain focused on a few technologies and concentrated\nin a limited number of countries. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). This trend is reflected in renewable power\ncapacity additions, as all of Africa accounted for less than 2% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA,\n2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023).\n\nTo achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. It is equally important that investments to modernise power grids and enhance operational flexibility\nincrease from the annual average investment of USD 274 billion in 2022 to USD 605 billion by 2030. 10 \n\nThis presents a dual challenge: 1) how to scale existing investment flows in countries and technologies;\nand 2) how to ensure these investment flows reach countries that are currently underserved by the\nenergy transition. Efforts to address the much higher cost of capital faced by developing economies –\nas much as three to five times more than in most OECD countries – are also needed (IRENA, 2023f). A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects.\n\nRepurposing public capital from the fossil fuel sector, including both direct investments and financial\nsupport in the form of subsidies, can help accelerate progress towards unlocking the capital required.\nThis public money can then catalyse private capital flows, amplifying investment efforts towards the\nUSD 35 trillion required (for the energy transition as a whole) in the remainder of this decade.\n\nFor example, public financial flows to fossil fuels in the G20 countries alone reached USD 1.4 trillion in\n2022 – more than double 2019 levels. Moreover, G20 governments supported the global fossil fuel industry\nthrough international aid, export credit support and concessional financing (such as equity, grants, loans\nand loan guarantees) at an average of USD 50 billion per year from 2019 to 2021 (IISD, 2023).\n\nPublic funding is urgently needed for basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to\ndrive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as industry and transport,\nor synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investment is scarce. Without this, the gap in\ninvestment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen, to the detriment of\nbillions of people and the success of a just and inclusive global energy transition.\n\nA more comprehensive definition of risk around investing in energy assets is needed. A narrow focus on\nthe return risk to investors must expand to encompass environmental and social risks. This approach,\nwhich should be exercised through rigorous international benchmarks and protocols for investment,\ncan also help to shift funding from fossil fuel assets to the renewables sector. With limited public funds\navailable in the developing world, the international community must step up.\n\nPublic funds (domestic or through international collaboration) must flow through intermediaries\n(e.g. governments, development finance institutions and global funds such as the Green Climate Fund).\nSuch instruments should channel public funds towards policies that support structural change and a\njust transition. Furthermore, these instruments should be designed progressively to ensure economic\nbenefits are shared in an equitable way.\n\nFinally, public investments are needed for economic interventions to support a more equitable\ndistribution of benefits from large-scale renewables growth. National carbon pricing revenues,\nfor example, could be redirected to support clean, affordable electricity access for lower-income\nhouseholds on a progressive basis.\n\nIt is also important to actively engage the private sector, given that public financing alone will not be\nanywhere near sufficient to address the huge investment needs for the global energy transition. The public\nsector can play a catalysing role by providing a conducive and predictable enabling environment for the\nlong-term investment decisions made in the private sector. Also, governments can set the right conditions\nfor private sector actors to build and finance a viable pipeline of energy transition-oriented projects.\n\nFor example, blended finance structures would allow concessional public finance, and even philanthropic\ngrant-based finance, to improve the risk-return profile of an investment, so that private capital is\nattracted at lower cost and/or better terms (IRENA, 2023g). Banks can also pool loans to relatively\nsmall renewables projects into a securitised product aimed at impact-minded investors, including retail\ninvestors who otherwise have few avenues to earn returns while funding renewables deployment (GFMA\nand BCG, 2020). The resulting financial portfolio of projects would reduce the perceived risk associated\nwith its individual components. Such an approach would require a level of contract standardisation to\nenable the bundling of small projects (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nWhile there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. In addition to the measures described above, capital mobilisation schemes like green\nbonds for renewables, as well as international coalition-building to guide distribution of renewables\ninvestment between the Global North and Global South, will be crucial to ensure renewables can\nequitably scale this decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation).\n    \nPromote the adoption of a comprehensive definition of investment risk within public and private\n    institutions that encompasses environmental and social externalities, thereby aligning financial\n    decision-making with broader public and social goals.\n    \nCollaborate with public and private sector actors to develop innovative, context-specific financing\n    and business models that address renewable energy financing gaps in underinvested countries.\n    This involves utilising blended finance, green bonds, financial aggregation, and innovative risk\n    mitigation tools tailored to each country’s unique needs.\n    \nDirect the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access.\n    \nFor Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. A fractured and unaligned approach to renewables deployment will lead\nto missed opportunities for countries to accelerate growth and enjoy the benefits of clean electricity,\nparticularly in the Global South. Public and private stakeholders alike are responsible for enhancing\nparticipation in multilateral initiatives that can facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building to\ndeliver a just transition via a 1.5°C pathway.\n\nWith the lion’s share of renewables investment benefiting developed economies, it will be important to\nstrengthen North-South and South-South collaboration to maximise the social and economic benefits\nfrom clean industrialisation. Country blocs such as the G20 can be powerful coalitions to mobilise support\nand investment around the global renewable energy target and its key enablers.\n\nMobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables.\n\nAdvanced economies are better positioned to mobilise public financing, but global policy frameworks are\nnecessary to secure affordable funding to underpin the energy transition at the national level elsewhere. In\nemerging economies, just transition funds need to be established to support plant closures, communities\nin transition, repurposing/rehabilitation, and retraining and skilling, among other priorities. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. A high proportion of the public funding mobilised will need to\nbe grant-based, avoiding the danger of adding to already high debt burdens faced by many countries.\n\nInternational climate finance has a key role to play in providing the public financing necessary for a just and\nfair energy transition. Its function will vary depending on the context; fossil fuel-dependent communities\nand countries will require targeted efforts to unwind lock-ins to the fossil fuel economy and plan an\nalternative development trajectory based on renewable power generation and economic activities (CPR,\n2021). Countries where mitigation requirements consistent with climate targets go beyond their fair\nshare of the global mitigation burden will require support to trigger the needed collaborative framework,\nleapfrog to renewables-based energy systems and reap their share of the transition benefits.\n\nIt will be important to ensure definitions, standards, governance and investment protocols for the\nenergy transition are fairly aligned to effectively funnel capital to renewables development that meets\nhigh social and environmental standards. From green taxonomy to emissions reduction standards, the\nneed for common ground in the renewables and green hydrogen sectors will be increasingly helpful for\nmultinational investors, companies and civil society actors to navigate the transition.\n\nInternational collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. There are many areas for continued innovation and learning, from DSM\nto LDES to green hydrogen derivatives – all of which will have a positive impact on decarbonisation.\nPlatforms for knowledge-sharing and imparting lessons learnt, such as the IRENA Collaborative Frameworks or the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), are important vehicles to ensure ambition\ncan be transformed into effective action at country level. This is particularly important for those countries\nthat are most vulnerable to the severe impacts of climate change, and so face more significant challenges\nto protect communities without adequate support for adaptation measures (UNCTAD, 2022).\n\nFinally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy.\nThe ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). Scaling up grid planning will support a more economic and\nsustainable approach to the transition, enabling better system balancing and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. This requires public-private platforms that bring governments together with financial institutions, renewable energy\n    developers and supply chain actors, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.\n    \nEnsure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth.\nEncourage robust standards and investment protocols for the transition that can allocate capital\n    to high-impact solutions in the renewables sector. This includes strict emissions standards as part\n    of green taxonomies to guide a capital shift away from fossil fuels and accelerate the development\n    of a green hydrogen sector.\nParticipate in platforms for knowledge-sharing and exchange on renewable energy research,\n    innovation and best practices across policy areas including auction design and corporate\n    procurement. Technology exchange and harmonised standards can also build the resilience of\n    the global renewable energy supply chain by achieving cost efficiencies, supporting best-in-class\n    asset development and lowering barriers to market.\nIntensify co-operation with neighbouring governments and grid authorities on regional grid\n    planning and opportunities for building interconnections, cross-border power trading, regional\n    power pools and innovative approaches like meshed grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario in the World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 shows, global energy-related\nCO2 emissions will need to be reduced significantly by 2030 to keep the Paris Agreement climate target\nwithin reach. This reduction will require a step change in action on both the supply and demand sides\nacross the entire energy system.\nTotal global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. This will\nneed to be complemented by a phase-down in fossil fuel generation, physical infrastructure upgrades,\nmodernisation and expansion, as well as enhanced grid flexibility.\nOn the demand side, energy efficiency improvements will be key. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This will not only require technological solutions but also behavioural\nchanges, necessitating greater awareness and broad support from communities and individuals for the\nenergy transition.\nThe twin goals of tripling renewable power and doubling energy efficiency by the end of this decade\nare undoubtedly challenging; but they are achievable. Their realisation requires urgent action by all\nstakeholders – governments (national, regional and local), international organisations, industry,\nfinance institutions and energy end-users (from big industrial users to individual households). The\nsooner we act, the sooner we will unlock the net economic, environmental and socio-economic benefits\nof an energy transition pathway that is consistent with the Paris Agreement goals.\n\nThis report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. They also need to make sure that the energy transition fosters socio-economic\nbenefits and minimises adverse environmental impacts. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth. Enhanced international collaboration can help facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building, as well as mobilise additional funding.\nThe current pace of action falls far short of that required to meet the 1.5°C target. COP28 provides a\nclear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit\nto tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target.

In IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario this will be driven by a combination\nof efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. These\nvital milestones must be achieved to keep the global energy transition on track\nto meet Paris Agreement goals.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF POLICIES IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THESE\nAMBITIOUS TARGETS. Aside from deployment and enabling policies, structural\nchange is needed to ensure the transition to an energy-efficient economy and a\nrenewables-based power system is just and fair, and provides benefits for all.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES ENABLING MEASURES THAT GO BEYOND\nREGULATIONS OR FISCAL AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. The organisational structures of power\nsectors must be reshaped to integrate a higher share of renewables. Procurement mechanisms\nmust be designed in a way that strengthens value chains and trade, and industrial policies must\nbe fit for building resilient supply chains. Education, training, re-skilling and up-skilling should\nbe prioritised; women and under-represented groups must be empowered; and collaboration\nbetween industry, civil society, policy makers and other key stakeholders should be encouraged.\n\nEXISTING ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE EXPANDED AND MODERNISED TO\nCREATE A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM FIT FOR RENEWABLES. There is an urgent need to boost crosssector infrastructure planning, increase cross-border co-operation and develop regional power\ngrids. Action is also needed to drive grid modernisation and expansion and ensure supply-side\nflexibility and demand-side management.\n\nRENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries.\n\nWE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. Annual average investment in renewable\npower generation must reach USD 1 300 billion by 2030, compared to 486 billion in 2022. In the\ndeveloping world, we must minimise investment risks and provide access to low-cost financing.\nThe global financial architecture must be reformed to support the energy transition in the Global\nSouth. Climate-related funding from multilateral development banks must be ramped up, and\npublic capital should be redirected from the fossil fuels sector to renewable energy.\n\nTHIS WILL REQUIRE STRONG INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. Immediate efforts are\nrequired to facilitate and contribute to multilateral initiatives that promote knowledge sharing\nand capacity building to deliver a just transition whilst also safeguarding nature and biodiversity.\nCollaboration is urgently required to foster collective action on governance, climate finance and\ninnovation. North-South and South-South dialogues should be cultivated; groups like the G7 and\nG20 must mobilise support and investment; and just transition funds should be established and\noperationalised in emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its\nlatest Assessment Report (AR6), sent a clear message to the world that this\ndecade is critical to our success in limiting global surface temperature increase\nto 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (IPCC, 2023).\nThere is an urgent need for rapid and immediate action to reduce global net\nanthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by almost 50% from 2019 levels\nby 2030, with a significant proportion of this reduction occurring within the field\nof energy.\n\nHowever, the energy transition remains off-track and global greenhouse gas\nemissions have reached record levels. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels.\nThis is far below the emission reductions required to place the world on a 1.5°C\npathway. The message is clear: we cannot limit global surface temperature\nincrease to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century without\nrapid, sustained and concerted action.\n\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake (GST), through which policy\nmakers, industry, financial institutions, civil society and other stakeholders will\nreflect on the progress achieved in implementing climate pledges since the\nadoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Leveraging low-cost solar PV, onshore and offshore wind, and\nother renewable electricity generation sources, the power sector must lead the way as solutions in other\nsectors scale up. Accelerating the progress of the transition worldwide requires a holistic approach,\nbacked by systemic innovation to transform existing structures and systems built for the fossil fuel era.\n\nWhilst the phase down of fossil fuels is both essential and inevitable, it must also be responsible. The\ntransition needs to be delivered in a way that ensures energy security, accessibility and affordability,\nwhile also sustaining socio-economic development and adopting nature-positive approaches. The\nspeed at which the transition is achieved will be determined by how quickly zero-carbon alternatives can\nbe introduced and scaled up.\n\nGreater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030.\nThese goals represent some of the most important levers for change to advance the energy transition\nthis decade.\n\nThis report consolidates high-level analysis of these targets, detailing existing shortfalls and identifying\nkey enablers to resolve them. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets.\n\nThe solutions presented are technologically mature, cost-competitive and commercially available, and can\nbe scaled up rapidly in most countries around the world; indeed, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind\nare already the most cost-competitive sources of new electricity supply in most countries today (IRENA,\n2023b). Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices.\nIt would also improve air quality and reduce health costs; deliver universal access to clean affordable\nenergy; and provide greater collective security and well-being. With the right policies in place, the global\nenergy transition will also bring extensive socio-economic benefits, including in the form of job creation\nand income generation.\n\nThe key enabling frameworks, policies and recommendations detailed in this report provide concrete\nadvice to governments around the world on the necessary steps required between now and 2030 to meet\nthese targets. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIt is essential that global leaders convening at COP28 demonstrate the collective will to set a new pace for\naction this decade by committing to these targets; in short, this is a critical step in a critical decade to keep\nthe 1.5°C target within reach. This will require accelerated actions in many areas, in particular modernising\nand expanding physical energy infrastructure; improving power system operations; establishing the\nright policies and regulatory frameworks; building resilient supply chains; and developing skills and\ninstitutional capacities. These actions must be underpinned by a significant increase in public and private\nfinancing, particularly to support the developing world.\n\nTo ensure the energy transition is both just and inclusive, greater international\ncollaboration is also needed. Worldwide, around 675 million people still lack access\nto electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking methods (IEA et al., 2023).\nProviding renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nForewords\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sultan Al Jaber\n            COP28 President-Designate\nTripling the deployment of renewable power generation and doubling\n            energy efficiency are amongst the most important levers to cut greenhouse\n            gas emissions.\nThe world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow.\nThe Global Stocktake has told us exactly how far off track we are. We need\n            to cut 22 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases in the next 7 years in order to\n            keep 1.5°C within reach.\nThe phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable and essential, but it must be\n            responsible. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy. Now is the time to turbocharge solutions and meet the\n            urgency of the moment with ambitious and determined action.\nAhead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in\n            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and\n            double energy efficiency.\nThis report outlines actionable solutions that can enable the progress we\n            need and demonstrates that this target is ambitious but achievable.\nI am now calling on everyone to come together, commit to common targets,\n            and take comprehensive domestic and international action, as outlined in\n            this report, to make our ambitions a reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco La Camera\n            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency\nOur mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,\n            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency\n            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the\n            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is\n            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action.\nA significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with\n            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is\n            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris\n            Agreement. This will require concerted action to urgently address deeply\n            entrenched systemic barriers across infrastructure, policy and institutional\n            capacities stemming from systems and structures created for the fossil\u0002-fuel era.\nWe must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing\n            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;\n            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted\n            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and\n            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and\n            capabilities match the energy system of the future. This is especially\n            important for developing countries, where we must deliver on our\n            commitments to sustainable development, ensuring no one is left behind.\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake, in which the world\n            reflects on its progress in implementing the Paris Agreement. It is vital that\n            collective action be galvanised following this key milestone in our journey\n            toward a climate-safe existence to ensure the forthcoming round of\n            Nationally Determined Contributions in 2025 represents a transformative\n            leap forward, realigning us with the 1.5°C goal. This report outlines the\n            essential actions governments must prioritise to achieve this objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Douglas\n            Chief Executive Officer, Global Renewables Alliance\nThis is the ‘make or break’ decade to avoid the most catastrophic impacts\n            of climate change. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future.\n            \nDouble down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This\n            would deliver cleaner electricity systems, access to affordable energy and\n            green jobs for millions of people, billions of dollars in public and private\n            capital to foster climate-resilient growth, and reduce loss and damage for\n            nature and people wrought by harmful climate change.\n            \nTo achieve these targets, we need to dramatically ramp up wind power,\n            solar power, hydropower and geothermal power. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. On average, 1 000 GW\n            of renewables needs to be installed each year for the rest of the decade to\n            bring total renewables capacity to 11 000 GW by 2030. As the growth curve\n            will rise over the course of the decade, the renewables industry believes\n            at least 1 500 GW of renewables capacity could be installed in 2030 alone.\n            \nGlobal leaders must commit to these targets at COP28. However, progress\n            towards 2030 goals cannot be taken for granted. Policy makers must\n            work hand-in-hand with industry and civil society to urgently implement\n            the enabling actions in this report, centred on: infrastructure and system\n            operation; policy and regulation; and supply chains, skills and capacities.\n            Critically, these areas must be reinforced by low-cost financing and\n            international collaboration.\n            \nThis is a unique “once in a generation” opportunity, but we need urgent\n            action to scale renewable energy in every region of the world. Only then\n            can we protect the planet and secure a liveable future for all.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPreface\r\n \n\n\n\n\nSince the Rio Earth Summit and the adoption of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, the\nConference of the Parties to the Convention (COP) has convened\nsignatory Parties each year to determine ambitions and responsibilities,\nand identify and assess the progress of climate measures. The 21st\nsession of the COP (COP21) led to the Paris Agreement, which mobilised\ncollective action to limit the increase in global average temperature\nto well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, pursue efforts to limit\nthe temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and\nstrengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.\n\nCOP28, and the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement, can\nbe the turning point on climate action over this critical decade to\naccelerate a transition that puts economies on the path toward a new\nlow-carbon, high-growth, sustainable economic model in a way that\nis both transformational and just. COP28 has the vision to deliver on\nthe pillars of the Paris Agreement, focusing on specific action on four\nparadigm shifts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nfast-tracking the energy transition and slashing emissions before 2030;\ntransforming climate finance, by delivering on old promises and\n    setting the framework for a new deal on finance;\nputting nature, people, lives and livelihoods at the heart of climate\n    action; and\nmobilising for the most inclusive COP ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nDisclaimer and acknowledgements\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThis publication and the material herein are provided “as is”.

According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario identifies a technically and economically feasible pathway to an energy future that\nis consistent with Paris Agreement goals. It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system.\n\nDespite the progress achieved to date, the current deployment of energy transition technologies is\ninsufficient in speed and scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions.\n\nBy 2030, global total installed renewable power generation capacity would need to expand more than\nthree-fold, from 3 382 GW in 2022 to 11 174 GW, according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Specifically,\ninstalled solar PV capacity would rise to more than 5 400 GW, from 1 055 GW in 2022, and wind installations\nwould surpass 3 500 GW (3 040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore), up from 899 GW in 2022, over the\nsame period (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c). The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. After solar PV and\nwind power, the third-largest increase in generation capacity would be in hydropower; by 2030, global\ninstalled hydropower capacity (excluding pumped hydro) would grow by almost 17% from the 2022 level,\nreaching 1 465 GW under the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario.\n\n\nFIGURE 1 Key performance indicators for achieving the 1.5°C Scenario in the Decade for Action\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c).\n\n\nThis suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Energy storage capacity would expand in tandem, with\ncumulative global battery storage increasing by a factor of 21, from 17 GW in 2020 to 359 GW in 2030\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRenewable power additions this decade may not be linear, however, with many factors impacting the\nrate of growth. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Some projections of solar growth foresee that 1 000 GW of annual solar PV installations\nalone may be reached as soon as 2028 (Haegel et al., 2023). To meet the tripling renewable power target,\nannual renewable additions need to ramp up as fast as possible, and as early as possible, in this decade.\n\nCountries and regions will follow different trajectories in accelerating the deployment of renewable\npower capacity. Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. This will allow them to assist others by sharing\nlessons learnt, technological and technical know-how, and experiences in establishing the right\nconditions for the scaling up of renewables.\n\nUnder the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario, the global solar PV market would be dominated by G20 countries; but\noutside this group, cumulative capacity will need to surpass 900 GW by 2030, while the cumulative capacity\nin G20 countries would reach approximately 4 530 GW. For wind, China, the United States, Canada, Brazil\nand several European countries have high onshore wind potential, while the majority of expansions in\noffshore wind would be in four key markets (China, EU-27, the United States and India), accounting for\nmore than 60% of offshore wind deployment by 2030. For hydropower, G20 countries together would\naccount for 79% (over 1 150 GW) of global hydropower capacity by 2030, with almost 305 GW of total\ncapacity spread across the rest of the world.\n\nFIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. Bioenergy includes biogas, biomass\nwaste and biomass solid.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nIt is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022).\n\nAccelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nIn 2010, the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of onshore wind was\nUSD 0.107/kilowatt hour (kWh) – 95% higher than the lowest fossil fuel cost of USD 0.056/kWh. Yet,\nby 2022, the global weighted average LCOE of new onshore wind projects was USD 0.033/kWh – 52%\nlower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option, at USD 0.069/kWh (Figure 3).\n\nThis improvement was surpassed by that of solar PV, however. In 2010, solar PV had a global weighted\naverage LCOE of USD 0.445/kWh – 710% more expensive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option; but\nby 2022, a spectacular decline in costs – to USD 0.049/kWh – made solar PV’s global weighted average\nLCOE 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nFIGURE 3 Cost competitiveness of solar and wind power, 2010-2022\n\nNote: LCOE = levelised cost of electricity.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nThe global weighted-average LCOE of offshore wind fell from being 258% more expensive than the cheapest\nfossil fuel option in 2010 to being just 17% more expensive in 2022, with costs falling from USD 0.197/kWh\nto USD 0.081/kWh. Concentrated solar power (CSP) saw its global weighted average LCOE fall from 591%\nhigher than the cheapest fossil fuel option in 2010 to 71% higher in 2022 (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nWhile hydropower’s global weighted average LCOE increased in 2021-2022 to USD 0.061/kWh – largely\nowing to the development of more challenging and remote sites – it remains cheaper than new\nfossil-fuel fired options. This is also true for geothermal projects, with a global weighted-average LCOE\nof USD 0.056/kWh in 2022, as well as for bioenergy projects, at USD 0.061/kWh (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nIt is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. 2 As 2022\nshowed, the indirect economic benefits of this enhanced energy security can be significant; yet they are\ntypically not valued in current policy.\n\nFIGURE 4 Investments required to meet the 1.5°C goal\n\nSource: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nSimilarly, the economic benefits of reducing pollution, and thereby improving climate, environmental and\nhealth outcomes, are almost never properly valued in policy-setting (IRENA, 2023b). These unpriced\nbenefits significantly improve the competitiveness of renewable power and make the business case for\naccelerated deployment even more compelling.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. This represents a transformative shift in power system\nsupply dynamics and poses new challenges to power system operations. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies.\n\nIn recent years, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity – known as ‘green hydrogen’ – and its\nderivatives have been identified as industrial feedstocks for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors.\nHydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. These measures can often generate\neconomic and environmental co-benefits. A range of measures will be needed across all end-use sectors,\nincluding modal shifts from private passenger cars to collective transport, and from passenger aviation\nand road-based freight to rail, as well as the adoption of circular economy principles, improved building\ninsulation, heat pumps and efficient electric motors – especially for industrial end-use sectors.\n\nEnergy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification.\nThe electrification of end-use sectors – such as in transport and buildings – would see a rise in direct use\nof electricity in total final energy consumption from 22% in 2020 to 29% in 2030.\n\nTechnical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nTo align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). If this rate is achieved, global final energy consumption would experience\nminimal growth over the same period.\n\nWith renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made.\n\nFIGURE 5 Energy intensity: Indicators in transport and buildings in 2030\n Based on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants.\nThis will require enhancements to – and expansion of – current power\ngrid systems, and the modernisation and upgrading of power system\noperations.\n\nWith VRE sources becoming the major source of power in a\n1.5°C-compatible world, countries must start upgrading and\nexpanding their power grid infrastructure to prepare for increasing\nend-use sector electrification. Multiple measures are required,\nincluding:\n\n\nInnovative power planning, grid expansion, modernisation and\n    enhancement, and addressing interconnection backlogs (projects\n    awaiting connection to the grid).\n    \nChanges in grid operation and management, potentially also\n    including new market design.\n    \nIncreased interconnectors between countries and regions.\n    \nGrowth in electricity storage; comprising short-duration storage\n    for increasing grid flexibility and long-duration storage to enhance\n    energy security (e.g. pumped storage).\n    \nMeasures to allow greater integration of demand-side management\n    and behind-the-meter (consumer) flexibility options (e.g. distributed\n    storage).\n    \nIntroducing other flexibility sources (e.g. green hydrogen, hybrid\n    renewable parks combining wind/solar/storage, etc.).\n    \n\n\nFIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). 4  With clarity on grid infrastructure development\nplans and reasonable guarantees on connection availability, investors will feel more confident building\nnew generation; meanwhile, consumers would be more likely to invest in electrification when a reliable\nsupply of low-cost electricity can be made available.\n\nWhen integrating higher shares of locally available variable solar and wind power, power systems will\nalso need to innovate to become: increasingly decentralised, allowing electricity to be generated at\nlocations closer to demand; and bi-directional, allowing electricity from distributed power generating\nfacilities to be injected into the grid.\n\nModernised, smarter grids are required; in the European Union (EU), around 30% of the envisaged\ninvestment in grids by 2030 could be earmarked for digitalisation 5  (European Commission, 2022).\nThey will also need to be larger and more robust. Hence, grid costs are expected to increase over time\n(IRENA, 2023a). This will require fast-tracked permitting to ensure timely investments in modern grids.\nAdding more widely distributed power generation sources will also bring resilience, especially against\nincreasingly intense extreme weather events owing to climate change (IPCC, 2023).\n\nThe electrification of transport also requires significant investments in enabling infrastructure. Electric\nvehicles will potentially account for more than 80% of all road transport activity by 2050; with 359 million\nelectric and plug-in hybrid light passenger vehicles worldwide by 2030 and 2 182 million by 2050 (IRENA,\n2023a); yet their market entry will be contingent upon coordinated investments in charging infrastructure\nand power grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure planning, timelines and assessments of investment needs for grids are aligned with long-term targets for renewable energy buildout and end-use sector decarbonisation, e.g. transport.\nMobilise funds for long-term grid investment; channel donor finance to building capacity and\n    infrastructure for integrating renewables; and streamline permitting procedures for new grid\n    infrastructure and upgrades to existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.\nDevelop modernised, decentralised (where suitable) and more resilient grid systems using\n    digitalisation, smart applications for demand-side management and interconnections with\n    neighbouring grid systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur.\nHistorically, this has been provided by pumped storage and hydropower with reservoirs.\nHowever, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). All of these technologies are undergoing rapid\ninnovation.\n\nFIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. saving energy from spring days with low loads and abundant solar to deploy\nduring high load days in the summer; or from windy autumn days to deploy during high load cloudy winter\ndays). Diverse storage technologies enhance the resilience of grids that are subject to extreme weather\nfor prolonged periods, help relieve grid congestion, provide transmission services and shore up local\narea reliability.\n\nLDES, including storage technologies spanning 10+, 24+, 100+ and 150+ hours in duration and providing\nboth power and heat, is also able to provide other grid services including black start (restarting parts\nof the grid where power has been lost in a blackout) and micro-grid level assistance for areas or key\ninfrastructure that may lose power. Storage durations can span weeks or months in the case of pumped\nstorage and reservoir hydropower. As the largest form of installed flexibility at over 175 GW worldwide,\npumped storage hydropower can play an important role in providing LDES and vital grid services, with\nsubstantial potential for off-river pumped storage to be developed in the coming decades (IHA, 2023).\nSome LDES technologies are commercially available today, while others are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Numerous companies are signing contracts (e.g. with utilities, airports, data centres,\nindustrial users, etc.) and are deploying LDES at grid-scale quantities, and pumped storage has been\nsuccessfully deployed for decades.\n\nOne emerging LDES technology is hydrogen storage. Hydrogen’s true competitive strength lies in its\nunique ability to store energy for long periods of time in large quantities. As green hydrogen displaces\nfossil fuels in some end uses, hydrogen storage could become increasingly critical to energy security,\nin the same way that natural gas storage is today in many regions. Hydrogen storage will be needed\nprimarily to meet variation in supply (rather than demand), as green hydrogen is created using VRE\nsources. Long-term hydrogen storage can play an important role in strengthening energy security and\nsystem resilience (IRENA, 2023d). Support for the continued development of these technologies is\ncritical for decarbonisation.\n\nIn many places, however, legacy market arrangements and policy frameworks do not incentivise\ninvestment in storage at scale. Action from policy makers can drive progress in this sector, such as:\nassessing energy storage and flexibility needs; setting LDES mandates for medium- and long-term\ncapacity targets; updating criteria for marketplaces; providing innovation grants and subsidies for prefeasibility studies; and establishing public-private partnerships.\n\nOther market innovations can also foster a healthy storage market, such as the introduction of congestion\nmanagement trading platforms, ancillary services markets to support the grid, and awarding additional\nvalue for features such as flexibility in capacity payments and capability to provide peaking power\n(e.g. storage technologies that can replace a natural gas peaking plant should be reflected in system\nmodelling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConduct technical assessments of system decarbonisation needs and timelines, and ensure the\n    planned buildout of renewables is complemented by storage resources of varying duration, as\n    well as other sources of flexibility.\nCollaborate with regulators and the renewables sector to enhance power market planning and\n    ensure price signals, clear targets and procurement incentivise longer duration storage.\nEncourage investment and innovation in diverse storage technologies to suit different users, such\n    as by establishing research, development and innovation (RDI) grant programmes, encouraging\n    public–private partnerships and setting medium- and long-term capacity targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-use electrification and sector coupling\nWith solar and wind power scaling up rapidly in this decade, electrification has become a vital\ndecarbonisation pathway. Green hydrogen and its derivatives, produced by electrolysers using low-cost\nrenewable power, can be used to decarbonise end-use sectors that are difficult to electrify directly –\nsuch as iron and steel making, and shipping – and to provide seasonal energy storage solutions.\n\nHowever, electrification needs to be accelerated by systemic innovation, making it not only faster but\nsmarter. Smart electrification – through sector coupling and enhanced flexibility – prevents a higher peak\nelectricity load on the power system. It also enables the power system to accommodate new loads while\nallowing integration of a higher share of variable renewable electricity in a cost-efficient manner. This\ncan help sustain renewables-based electrification without jeopardising energy system operation, thus\nmaking the power system robust and resilient. To harness all these benefits, systemic innovation should\ninvolve the entire energy value chain across four key dimensions: technology and infrastructure; market\ndesign and regulation; system planning and operation; and business models (IRENA, 2023d). Smart\ncharging for electric vehicles is a good example in this regard.\n\nSector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nThe benefit of this will be smarter, more intelligent demand-side management, achieved by deploying\nmore advanced digital technologies both behind-the-meter (by energy consumers) and in power\nsystems. Demand response would become more agile and inter-operational through sector-coupled\ntechnologies such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to smart charging\nfacilities. This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nEnd-use electrification, sector-coupling and the rapid scale-up of variable renewable electricity all\nrequire integrated cross-sectoral infrastructure planning – a process for optimising the co-development\nof increasingly connected infrastructure in various sectors. 7 The European Hotmaps project offers an\nopen-source toolbox to support public authorities, energy agencies and urban planners as they plan\nheating and cooling at local, regional and national levels. It allows users to map cooling and heating\ndemand, as well as supply, in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom, and provides renewable\nenergy generation and industrial waste heat potentials (Hotmaps, 2021). This facilitates the integration\nof heating and cooling with waste-to-energy and renewable energy, including power-to-heat. However,\nthis planning approach requires incentives for infrastructure investments where market barriers exist,\ngiven that different infrastructures operate under different legislative, regulatory and policy regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt a sector-coupling approach to the decarbonisation of economies by pursuing smart\n    electrification of the transport, buildings and industry sectors.\nCreate fora for co-ordinated planning among relevant authorities on infrastructure development,\n    including renewable energy projects, grid and transmission assets, electric vehicle charging\n    infrastructure and heat networks.\nIntroduce economic incentives for smart electrification and demand-side response (such as tax\n    credits and innovation grants) to encourage private investment in sector-coupling solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand-side management\nElectricity systems are complex; in addition to the grid infrastructure planning required to unlock the\nbenefits of sector coupling, distributed grid planning and operations will need well-defined energy\nmanagement schemes on both sides of the end-user meter. These schemes apply to both the supply side\n(power management) and demand side (load management).\nDemand-side management (DSM) comprises a set of strategies traditionally aimed at reducing peak\ndemand, which will be increasingly needed to incentivise consumption in periods of high VRE generation.\nDSM addresses various challenges, including VRE integration, rising electricity costs and environmental\nimpacts. For example, DSM can employ time-of-use pricing to encourage customers to shift electricity\nusage to off-peak hours, while demand response programmes can financially reward customers for\nreducing electricity usage during peak hours or consuming electricity during high VRE generation\nperiods. Critical-peak pricing, real-time pricing and critical-peak rebates are also among the strategies\navailable. These approaches are crucial for optimising energy efficiency in both residential and industrial\nbuildings.\nAs the transition advances, DSM will also provide flexibility to alleviate the need for more costly\nrequirements. Several challenges persist, however – particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, and other Global South regions. Notable issues include physical grid and digital technology\ninfrastructure gaps, as well as complex and inconsistent regulations and policies. Financing challenges\nalso hinder progress; attracting investment in clean energy enablers like DSM solutions requires\ninnovative financing models and incentives.\nIntelligent load control, demand response and energy efficiency are pivotal in enabling a secure and\nresilient renewables-based power system. Continued investment and innovation in these areas will\nfurther drive the adaptation of demand to supply in a renewable energy-driven future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAssess the cost-benefit of investment in DSM programmes, accounting for the energy and cost\n    savings it can provide instead of investing in grid infrastructure expansion.\nEnsure grid planning prioritises modernisation and DSM technology to close critical technology\n    gaps as infrastructure expands. Developing economies can explore innovative financing models –\n    such as blended finance – to mobilise investment in grid and DSM solutions.\nImprove data availability within the wider electricity system to enable innovation in DSM and\n    access to applications like smart meters by consumers and third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nGovernments have a crucial role to play in tripling renewable power capacity and placing the world on a\n1.5°C pathway. All too often, the energy transition discourse relegates governments’ responsibilities to\ncreating an enabling environment for private investments through predictable and stable policies, and\nthe creation of instruments that de-risk investment projects. Although this is crucial, a much broader and\nmore integrated policy approach is required to facilitate the adoption of an entire spectrum of energy\ntransition solutions needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and unlock its socio-economic benefits (Figure 8).\n\nGovernments need to be far more engaged in shaping and guiding the energy transition, including through\npolicies for ambitious public investment programmes and sufficient forward-planning for renewables\nscale-up, system integration and grid build-out.\n\nCross-cutting approaches covering all renewable technologies, electrification technologies and others\nare needed to facilitate the energy transition (e.g. energy storage), include enabling policies that set\nambitions and send clear signals to stakeholders, eliminate distortions, incentivise the uptake of solutions\nand facilitate access to affordable financing. They also include policies that ensure the integration of\nrenewables within energy systems, economies, nature and societies, as well as specific deployment\npolicies for various technologies. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand.\n\nTransitioning to a renewables-based economy may also bring challenges in the form of financing gaps,\nlabour market disruptions and energy sector insecurity. These misalignments, if not well-managed,\nrisk inequitable outcomes and a slower pace of the energy transition. Therefore, a set of structural and\njust transition policies, along with the creation of strong institutions to ensure policy co-ordination and\ncohesion, is required to manage potential misalignments.\n\nFinally, a holistic global policy framework that entails international collaboration including North-South\nand South-South co-operation is needed to bring stakeholders from countries around the world together\nto commit to a just transition that leaves no one behind and strengthens international finance flows,\ncapacities and technologies in an equitable manner.\n\nThis section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nFIGURE 8 The IRENA holistic policy framework for a just and inclusive energy transition\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2021b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Enhanced energy efficiency is a crucial enabler for making high\nlevels of end-use electrification feasible and affordable. Measures related to reducing energy demand\nand improving efficiency are needed across all end-use sectors.\n\nMinimum energy performance standards (MEPS) can support industrial, commercial and residential\nusers to procure and switch to more energy efficient appliances or equipment such as electric heating/\ncooling technologies. Building codes can set energy performance requirements by specifying insulation\nstandards, thereby reducing heating and cooling demands. They can also specify greenhouse gas\nemission targets and carbon footprints. For renovation, in particular, codes can be coupled with financial\nincentives.\n\nIt is also important to address prevailing challenges associated with building ownership structures,\nequitable access and benefit-sharing of energy efficiency investments and policies. “Green loans” could\ncarry lower interest rates and protect low-income energy consumers from energy price fluctuations\nand inflationary environments. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.\n\nIn the transport sector, significant improvements can be achieved by promoting energy efficient mobility\n(e.g. public transport such as railways, metros and buses, and car-sharing), as well as active (nonmotorised) transport such as cycling and walking in urban areas. Public campaigns can be undertaken by\nnational and local governments to encourage green mobility modes. Other policies, such as differentiated\nparking fees and highway tolls, can encourage a shift to public transport, complemented by dedicated\ndriving lanes for car-sharing. Public transportation fleets also offer the opportunity to utilise costcompetitive renewable fuels or electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement with specific time horizons and outline\n    clear avenues for implementation.\n    \nStrengthen regulatory frameworks, including building codes that specify low energy performance\n    and appliance energy efficiency standards.\n    \nExpand the availability of financial incentives and affordable lending schemes for meeting\n    standards on energy efficiency, such as tax credits or green loans with favourable interest rates\n    for building renovation or modernisation.\n    \nEstablish public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy efficiency measures, public\n    transport and green mobility for cost savings and collective decarbonisation goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket incentives and fiscal policy\nWhile renewables have become increasingly competitive, they still face barriers compared to fossil fuels.\nRising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective. The choice of instrument and its design should consider: the nature of the solution\n(e.g. utility-scale, distributed, off-grid); level of development of the sector; power system organisational\nstructure; wider macroeconomic environment (e.g. impact of inflation and commodity price volatility);\nand broader policy objectives. It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below). This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk. A mechanism to allow for bilateral power\nprocurement between generators and private off-takers (such as industrial actors or corporates) can\nfurther strengthen the case for large deployment volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments.\n    \nIntroduce tax credits, levies and/or exemptions on import/export duties for key materials and\n    components in the renewable energy supply chain.\n    \nEnsure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains.\n    \nConsider the trade-offs between ‘lowest-price’ objectives, and other policy outcomes such as\n    socio-economic development, system integration and industry sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower market design and regulation\nThe world is entering a new era in which electricity systems will be increasingly dominated by zeromarginal-cost renewable technologies. Power markets must evolve and adapt to new market forces,\nsuch as corporate and industrial demand, and behind-the-meter (prosumer) generation. They must be\norganised in a way that incentivises new investment in renewable power generation and the flexibility to\nprovide reliable electricity at a level required for the 1.5°C pathway. This requires governments and other\nstakeholders to undertake a close examination of their power systems’ organisational structures, i.e. the\ninstitutions, processes and arrangements through which electricity services are exchanged and rewarded.\n\nWholesale power markets today are based on marginal cost pricing, where the most expensive\ngenerator (with the highest variable cost – typically fossil fuel-fired plants) determines electricity\nprices for the time period in which the market operates. This poses a number of challenges. As the\nshare of renewable power grows, wholesale spot markets will see increased price volatility, as periods\nof high renewable power generation push clearing prices in the wholesale market close to zero. When\nrenewable generation is less than demand, flexibility resources will be needed, potentially resulting in\nvery high prices at certain times.\n\nIf wholesale markets are the main source of revenue, the economic feasibility of new investments will\nplummet, as even existing generators will struggle to recover their initial capital costs whilst prospective\ninvestors realise diminishing returns. The paradigm that relies on free markets to incentivise power\nsupply investment decisions therefore needs to change.\n\nUltimately, a renewables-based power system requires enhanced flexibility; wholesale market design\nmust deliver this as well as providing the volume of renewable power needed. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.\n\nPower system organisational structures must evolve to better align with energy policy and\ndecarbonisation goals. A “dual procurement” power market design could introduce long-term\ncontract mechanisms (e.g. Auctions, CfDs, PPAs) as the backbone of renewable power procurement,\nalongside a short-term market to dispatch flexible resources in an affordable way (IRENA, 2022a).\nThis holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system.\n\nThis transformation is partially underway, as auctions are becoming the preferred tool to procure\nrenewable energy, and wholesale markets are becoming more time and location granular (IRENA,\n2023a); but there are meaningful actions authorities can take now to ensure the acceleration of this trend.\n\nOne way to achieve enhanced system flexibility is for power markets to allow flexibility technologies\n(such as batteries and pumped hydropower) to provide ancillary services and be rewarded accordingly.\nAncillary services that serve to stabilise the grid network and will become increasingly important as\ndispatchable fossil fuel-based generation is phased out of the power mix. Today, many power systems\nreward the provision of energy but not ancillary services (where these services are not included in\ncontractual obligations). They therefore need to be appropriately valued and reflected in power system\ndesign. Valuing, pricing and procuring ancillary services astutely can bring new players to the grid, with\nadvantages for the whole power system. Examples of this include the enhanced frequency regulation\nauctions in the UK.\n\nTo achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This includes growth in distributed renewable energy\ngeneration systems – notably using solar PV – but also community solar and wind projects. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. Such measures can maximise the socio-economic benefits of renewable energy, insulate consumers from price volatility, create local supply\nchains and job opportunities, and enhance public perceptions of renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors.\nDesign auctions that balance competitive price discovery and long-term delivery of affordable\n    electricity. Auctions should also be run for sufficiently large and ambitious volumes, with\n    consistent, transparent tendering schedules to effectively foster competitive bidding.\nCreate a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix.\nRethink participation rules to allow new technologies to engage in the power market as flexibility\n    providers, including storage and demand side aggregators.\nEncourage investment in distributed renewable energy systems that allow consumers to become\n    “prosumers” by both using and producing clean electricity.\nReorganise power market structures to ensure policies for accelerating renewables deployment\n    account for system flexibility as well as sustainable returns to generators and investors.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamlining permitting\nThe time and cost constraints imposed by permitting procedures represent a major bottleneck\nimpacting the deployment of renewable energy projects in many countries. It is essential that permitting\nprocedures are fit-for-purpose and keep pace with renewable and climate targets, without compromising\nenvironmental and social impact standards. Experiences from the public and private sectors indicate\nthat best practices in permitting centre on four areas: administrative consolidation; digitalisation; policy\nsupport; and public engagement (European Commission, 2023).\n\nRenewable energy developers often need to consult numerous authorities at national, sub-national and\nsometimes village or prefecture level for the necessary permits to build a project. This process can be\nlengthy and extremely bureaucratic; for instance, the global average time required for permitting an\noffshore wind project is nine years. Onshore wind and utility-scale PV permitting processes can also\nbe long, although they are typically shorter than those for offshore wind. Similar obstacles exist for\nhydropower projects and smaller scale distributed projects for end consumers using renewable energy\ntechnologies like rooftop solar.\n\nCreating dedicated, centralised authorities is one way to streamline this process by ensuring developers\ncan refer to a single focal point. Countries like Denmark and the Philippines have already adopted a “one-stop shop” model to accelerate renewables deployment, but this model only works if it is adequately\nresourced. In addition, digitalised processes to submit and track applications would enable developments\nto progress more efficiently, while access to digitised local consenting and historical dispute records\nwould allow developers and authorities to screen sites that could be high-risk or unsuitable at an early\nstage (IRENA, 2023h).\n\nAn overarching best practice is the introduction of legislation mandating a maximum lead time for the\npermitting of renewable energy projects. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. Gaining social acceptance through\npublic engagement with relevant stakeholders is critical in the consenting and constructing stages of a\nrenewable energy project. This includes early and continuous consultation by authorities and developers\nwith local communities to communicate the benefits and considerations brought by a project to the area,\nas well as a transparent conflict resolution mechanism that sincerely addresses community concerns.\n\nComprehensive and efficient permitting frameworks represent a clear win-win, allowing renewable\nenergy development to expand this decade while cultivating acceptance with other interests in land and\nsea spaces. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023).\n\nRecent studies indicate that adopting best practices in permitting could cut consenting time for utility-scale wind and solar projects by more than half; for example, onshore wind farms could be permitted in\none year, offshore wind farms in 1.5 years and solar farms in as little as three months (ETC, 2023). This\nmakes permitting a high-impact enabler for the energy transition, where the necessary investment in\nresource, policy support and capacity will bring enormous value to countries in accelerating renewables\ngrowth and securing associated socio-economic and environmental benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023).\n\nThe energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. If not well managed, these\nmisalignments risk inequitable outcomes, which could sow doubt among policy makers and the\npublic concerning the advantages of the transition and lead to a fractured and unco-ordinated policy\nenvironment. Hence, there is a need for policies and measures that equitably distribute the benefits of\nthe energy transition and raise public awareness about these positive impacts.\n\nIn terms of jobs, sectoral misalignments may arise due to potential shifts in value and supply chains\nduring the energy transition. For instance, transitioning from fossil fuel power generation to solar energy\nmay shift the focus from fuel extraction to the semi-conductor industry. The impact on employment\ndepends on factors such as domestic production and labour productivity. Labour-market interventions\nencompass adequate employment services attuned to evolving circumstances and needs, along with\nmeasures to facilitate labour mobility (IRENA and ILO, 2023).\n\nCommunity benefit schemes span countries from Costa Rica to Mali and adopt a range of structures,\nfrom shared ownership of renewable assets to industry sponsorship of critical social and economic\ninfrastructure in host communities (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2020). Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions.\n\nAligning policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition will facilitate local\nvalue creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, and on a larger scale, ensure political\nand social stability as renewable energy expands.\n\nAs part of a sensitive and efficient permitting framework, renewable development must be well integrated\nwith the principles of sustainability, circular economy and reduced environmental impact – particularly\non land use and biodiversity. This also applies to enabling infrastructure, with grid expansion into remote\nand biodiverse areas requiring careful siting.\n\nAdopting sustainable end-of-life management policies, including waste management legislation, can\nhelp countries prepare for the anticipated volumes of equipment waste such as solar PV panels and\nbatteries. Research and development programmes across the energy and waste sectors, and industrial\nclusters, can help to further scale waste management infrastructure on a national or regional basis\n(IRENA and IEA, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition and foster local\n    value creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, with a special focus on the\n    inclusion of marginalised groups.\nAnticipate labour market disruptions and establish programmes that can address workforce\n    gaps, minimise labour misalignments, create opportunities for targeted recruitment and labour\n    mobility, such as relocation grants, and establish social protection programmes.\nMinimise adverse environmental impacts and encourage nature-positive approaches, for example\n    by incentivising the uptake of sustainability standards for new renewable energy assets – such as\n    the Hydropower Sustainability Standard – as part of procurement schemes.\nEnsure the impacts of mining activities and the use of relatively scarce components are mitigated\n    through provisions for circular economy (end-of-life management, recycling and reuse of materials).\nGather information on renewables’ waste production through regular monitoring of waste\n    produced by technology, the composition of waste streams, installed system performance and the\n    causes and frequency of system failures, in order to adopt waste minimisation legislation suitable\n    for the pace and scale of the transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\r\n \n\n\n\n\nBuilding resilient supply chains\nThe vulnerabilities of key energy industries to logistics bottlenecks, commodity price volatility, trade\nbarriers, and commodity and component import dependencies have become increasingly apparent in\nrecent years. Energy supply chains have become a priority agenda for policy makers, as demand and\ncompetition for critical raw materials, rare earth elements and production capacity become more acute.\n\nWithout well-functioning and cost-efficient industrial supply chains, the energy transition will not\nmaterialise. If not well managed, competition, security and scarcity challenges in renewable energy\nsupply chains could lead to a disorderly transition, characterised by slower rates of renewables\ndeployment at inflated costs. A mismatch between supply and demand for several critical minerals is\nalready evident, with particularly high levels observed for lithium – a key material required for the shortduration energy storage and electric transport sectors (IRENA, 2023e). Bottlenecks for key components\nin the wind industry – e.g. nacelles, blades and gearboxes – are set to emerge by the second half of this\ndecade in Asia and the Americas (GWEC, 2023). High concentration risk in the global renewables supply\nchain also raises the prospect of price or security of supply uncertainty in the future.\n\nRobust and resilient global supply chains are required to support a 1.5°C pathway. The mining and\nprocessing of critical materials including lithium, copper, nickel and other rare earth metals are\nconstrained within specific geographies, exposing these supply chains to geopolitical tensions and\nconcentration risks (IRENA, 2023e). Policy makers should work with the private sector to identify\nproduction gaps and supply chain weaknesses on a national and regional basis, and generate strategies\nto reinforce supply chain security.\n\nSocially responsible procurement is another key issue, where many critical materials and components\nrefined or manufactured in one country are imported by others for use in the renewables sector. It will\nbe vital to ensure supply chains – in the mining and processing segments in particular – are managed\nwith respect to fair trade, and high environmental, social governance (ESG) and sustainability standards.\nResilient supply chains are also key to sustaining the cost-value proposition of renewable energy around\nthe world.\n\nAs countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. The need for local value creation and regional supply chain\ninvestment must be carefully balanced with reducing trade barriers for goods and services central to\nthe renewables renewables industry. This will be key to avoid intensifying supply chain bottlenecks\nand making renewables less cost-competitive, while maximising socio-economic benefits.\n\nMultilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. This will require governments to work with industry, civil society and other stakeholders to\nensure supply chain planning is conducted through a wider lens that encompasses national interests,\ncost-effective and socially responsible sourcing, long-term social and environmental sustainability, and\nclimate and renewable energy targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate with the renewables industry on industrial development reviews and plans for the\n    transition that are sustainable, achievable, and adequately mitigate risk of supply insecurity\n    and price volatility. Approaches include diversifying sources of production, anticipating critical\n    production gaps and localising value chains.\nEnsure socially responsible procurement of renewables by encouraging uptake of sustainable\n    supply chain assurance schemes, such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative.\nIncentivise public–private partnerships and investment in circularity to encourage reuse of\n    materials and a circular economy approach to project development, which can help to reduce\n    concentration risk and supply insecurity of critical materials.\nCo-operate with international fora and financial institutions to safeguard international trade\n    corridors for materials and components for key renewable energy technologies.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation, training and capacity-building\nBuilding a skilled energy transition workforce requires measures to both expand the talent pipeline and\nenhance the quality of education and training provisions.\n\nEarly exposure to renewable energy topics and careers is vital for sparking interest in pursuing a career in the\nsector, but also to increase social acceptance by a knowledgeable citizenry. The curricula at higher education\nand vocational training institutions must reflect the skills and competences required by the transition.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the content of education and training programmes, it is also important to\nenhance the instructional methods used. For example, experiential learning methods where students are\nencouraged to develop problem-solving strategies can help to prepare learners for jobs in the constantly\nevolving renewable energy sector, where independent knowledge-seeking will often be necessary.\n\nFacilitating collaboration between government agencies on workforce development, industry and\neducational institutions will contribute to more co-ordinated skill-matching efforts. It is vital to consider\nhow a just transition can respond to potential labour displacement in the existing energy sector workforce\nand re-skill or upskill appropriately.\n\nTargeted measures to train, recruit and retain women and other underrepresented or marginalised groups\n(including older workers, ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities and those on a low\nincome) will ensure the dividends of the transition are enjoyed by all. This inclusion can be implemented\nthrough early exposure to renewable energy leadership and career pathways, targeted scholarships,\ngovernment-funded training opportunities, and industry apprenticeship and mentorship schemes.\n\nOutside the renewables industry, it is equally important to ensure sufficiently skilled and trained workers\nare available in government departments concerned with international trade, supply chains, electric\ncharging infrastructure and land use. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government.\n\nCarefully designed public-private partnerships (PPPs) can also play a crucial role in improving overall\ntraining quality while meeting sectoral labour requirements, promoting national skill standards and\nmatchmaking communities with workplace training opportunities. In addition to improving training\ncontent, PPPs can also play a role in shifting the financing of training provisions to a more integrated\napproach that incorporates multiple funding mechanisms including payroll-based training levies, tax\nincentives, scholarships and donations, vouchers and student loans (Dunbar, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign workforce planning among all stakeholders, including labour agencies, labour unions, the\n    wider energy industry and educational institutions, to identify critical skill gaps and workforce\n    needs in advance, and to design skill-building strategies accordingly.\nProvide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition.\nEnsure energy transition goals are reflected in educational programmes and resources, such\n    as university curricula, vocational training institutions, occupational health and safety training\n    institutions, and professional education programmes.\nBuild the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce.\nInvest in reskilling and upskilling measures for vulnerable communities and those in fossil fuel\n    industries to ensure the employment benefits of the transition are extended to a wide subset of\n    the population. Such measures need to be embedded in broader regional economic revitalisation\n    programmes and investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). However, investments remain focused on a few technologies and concentrated\nin a limited number of countries. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). This trend is reflected in renewable power\ncapacity additions, as all of Africa accounted for less than 2% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA,\n2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023).\n\nTo achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. It is equally important that investments to modernise power grids and enhance operational flexibility\nincrease from the annual average investment of USD 274 billion in 2022 to USD 605 billion by 2030. 10 \n\nThis presents a dual challenge: 1) how to scale existing investment flows in countries and technologies;\nand 2) how to ensure these investment flows reach countries that are currently underserved by the\nenergy transition. Efforts to address the much higher cost of capital faced by developing economies –\nas much as three to five times more than in most OECD countries – are also needed (IRENA, 2023f). A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects.\n\nRepurposing public capital from the fossil fuel sector, including both direct investments and financial\nsupport in the form of subsidies, can help accelerate progress towards unlocking the capital required.\nThis public money can then catalyse private capital flows, amplifying investment efforts towards the\nUSD 35 trillion required (for the energy transition as a whole) in the remainder of this decade.\n\nFor example, public financial flows to fossil fuels in the G20 countries alone reached USD 1.4 trillion in\n2022 – more than double 2019 levels. Moreover, G20 governments supported the global fossil fuel industry\nthrough international aid, export credit support and concessional financing (such as equity, grants, loans\nand loan guarantees) at an average of USD 50 billion per year from 2019 to 2021 (IISD, 2023).\n\nPublic funding is urgently needed for basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to\ndrive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as industry and transport,\nor synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investment is scarce. Without this, the gap in\ninvestment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen, to the detriment of\nbillions of people and the success of a just and inclusive global energy transition.\n\nA more comprehensive definition of risk around investing in energy assets is needed. A narrow focus on\nthe return risk to investors must expand to encompass environmental and social risks. This approach,\nwhich should be exercised through rigorous international benchmarks and protocols for investment,\ncan also help to shift funding from fossil fuel assets to the renewables sector. With limited public funds\navailable in the developing world, the international community must step up.\n\nPublic funds (domestic or through international collaboration) must flow through intermediaries\n(e.g. governments, development finance institutions and global funds such as the Green Climate Fund).\nSuch instruments should channel public funds towards policies that support structural change and a\njust transition. Furthermore, these instruments should be designed progressively to ensure economic\nbenefits are shared in an equitable way.\n\nFinally, public investments are needed for economic interventions to support a more equitable\ndistribution of benefits from large-scale renewables growth. National carbon pricing revenues,\nfor example, could be redirected to support clean, affordable electricity access for lower-income\nhouseholds on a progressive basis.\n\nIt is also important to actively engage the private sector, given that public financing alone will not be\nanywhere near sufficient to address the huge investment needs for the global energy transition. The public\nsector can play a catalysing role by providing a conducive and predictable enabling environment for the\nlong-term investment decisions made in the private sector. Also, governments can set the right conditions\nfor private sector actors to build and finance a viable pipeline of energy transition-oriented projects.\n\nFor example, blended finance structures would allow concessional public finance, and even philanthropic\ngrant-based finance, to improve the risk-return profile of an investment, so that private capital is\nattracted at lower cost and/or better terms (IRENA, 2023g). Banks can also pool loans to relatively\nsmall renewables projects into a securitised product aimed at impact-minded investors, including retail\ninvestors who otherwise have few avenues to earn returns while funding renewables deployment (GFMA\nand BCG, 2020). The resulting financial portfolio of projects would reduce the perceived risk associated\nwith its individual components. Such an approach would require a level of contract standardisation to\nenable the bundling of small projects (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nWhile there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. In addition to the measures described above, capital mobilisation schemes like green\nbonds for renewables, as well as international coalition-building to guide distribution of renewables\ninvestment between the Global North and Global South, will be crucial to ensure renewables can\nequitably scale this decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation).\n    \nPromote the adoption of a comprehensive definition of investment risk within public and private\n    institutions that encompasses environmental and social externalities, thereby aligning financial\n    decision-making with broader public and social goals.\n    \nCollaborate with public and private sector actors to develop innovative, context-specific financing\n    and business models that address renewable energy financing gaps in underinvested countries.\n    This involves utilising blended finance, green bonds, financial aggregation, and innovative risk\n    mitigation tools tailored to each country’s unique needs.\n    \nDirect the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access.\n    \nFor Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. A fractured and unaligned approach to renewables deployment will lead\nto missed opportunities for countries to accelerate growth and enjoy the benefits of clean electricity,\nparticularly in the Global South. Public and private stakeholders alike are responsible for enhancing\nparticipation in multilateral initiatives that can facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building to\ndeliver a just transition via a 1.5°C pathway.\n\nWith the lion’s share of renewables investment benefiting developed economies, it will be important to\nstrengthen North-South and South-South collaboration to maximise the social and economic benefits\nfrom clean industrialisation. Country blocs such as the G20 can be powerful coalitions to mobilise support\nand investment around the global renewable energy target and its key enablers.\n\nMobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables.\n\nAdvanced economies are better positioned to mobilise public financing, but global policy frameworks are\nnecessary to secure affordable funding to underpin the energy transition at the national level elsewhere. In\nemerging economies, just transition funds need to be established to support plant closures, communities\nin transition, repurposing/rehabilitation, and retraining and skilling, among other priorities. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. A high proportion of the public funding mobilised will need to\nbe grant-based, avoiding the danger of adding to already high debt burdens faced by many countries.\n\nInternational climate finance has a key role to play in providing the public financing necessary for a just and\nfair energy transition. Its function will vary depending on the context; fossil fuel-dependent communities\nand countries will require targeted efforts to unwind lock-ins to the fossil fuel economy and plan an\nalternative development trajectory based on renewable power generation and economic activities (CPR,\n2021). Countries where mitigation requirements consistent with climate targets go beyond their fair\nshare of the global mitigation burden will require support to trigger the needed collaborative framework,\nleapfrog to renewables-based energy systems and reap their share of the transition benefits.\n\nIt will be important to ensure definitions, standards, governance and investment protocols for the\nenergy transition are fairly aligned to effectively funnel capital to renewables development that meets\nhigh social and environmental standards. From green taxonomy to emissions reduction standards, the\nneed for common ground in the renewables and green hydrogen sectors will be increasingly helpful for\nmultinational investors, companies and civil society actors to navigate the transition.\n\nInternational collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. There are many areas for continued innovation and learning, from DSM\nto LDES to green hydrogen derivatives – all of which will have a positive impact on decarbonisation.\nPlatforms for knowledge-sharing and imparting lessons learnt, such as the IRENA Collaborative Frameworks or the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), are important vehicles to ensure ambition\ncan be transformed into effective action at country level. This is particularly important for those countries\nthat are most vulnerable to the severe impacts of climate change, and so face more significant challenges\nto protect communities without adequate support for adaptation measures (UNCTAD, 2022).\n\nFinally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy.\nThe ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). Scaling up grid planning will support a more economic and\nsustainable approach to the transition, enabling better system balancing and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. This requires public-private platforms that bring governments together with financial institutions, renewable energy\n    developers and supply chain actors, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.\n    \nEnsure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth.\nEncourage robust standards and investment protocols for the transition that can allocate capital\n    to high-impact solutions in the renewables sector. This includes strict emissions standards as part\n    of green taxonomies to guide a capital shift away from fossil fuels and accelerate the development\n    of a green hydrogen sector.\nParticipate in platforms for knowledge-sharing and exchange on renewable energy research,\n    innovation and best practices across policy areas including auction design and corporate\n    procurement. Technology exchange and harmonised standards can also build the resilience of\n    the global renewable energy supply chain by achieving cost efficiencies, supporting best-in-class\n    asset development and lowering barriers to market.\nIntensify co-operation with neighbouring governments and grid authorities on regional grid\n    planning and opportunities for building interconnections, cross-border power trading, regional\n    power pools and innovative approaches like meshed grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario in the World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 shows, global energy-related\nCO2 emissions will need to be reduced significantly by 2030 to keep the Paris Agreement climate target\nwithin reach. This reduction will require a step change in action on both the supply and demand sides\nacross the entire energy system.\nTotal global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. This will\nneed to be complemented by a phase-down in fossil fuel generation, physical infrastructure upgrades,\nmodernisation and expansion, as well as enhanced grid flexibility.\nOn the demand side, energy efficiency improvements will be key. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This will not only require technological solutions but also behavioural\nchanges, necessitating greater awareness and broad support from communities and individuals for the\nenergy transition.\nThe twin goals of tripling renewable power and doubling energy efficiency by the end of this decade\nare undoubtedly challenging; but they are achievable. Their realisation requires urgent action by all\nstakeholders – governments (national, regional and local), international organisations, industry,\nfinance institutions and energy end-users (from big industrial users to individual households). The\nsooner we act, the sooner we will unlock the net economic, environmental and socio-economic benefits\nof an energy transition pathway that is consistent with the Paris Agreement goals.\n\nThis report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. They also need to make sure that the energy transition fosters socio-economic\nbenefits and minimises adverse environmental impacts. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth. Enhanced international collaboration can help facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building, as well as mobilise additional funding.\nThe current pace of action falls far short of that required to meet the 1.5°C target. COP28 provides a\nclear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit\nto tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target. Now is\nthe time for an ambitious new pledge that safeguards the wellbeing of our planet and enables the\nequitable distribution of the benefits of the energy transition among all peoples, nations and regions\nof the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nReferences\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPR (2021), Managing a fair transition away from coal in India, Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi, www.cprindia.org/managing-fair-transition-away-coal-india\n\nDunbar, M.

In IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario this will be driven by a combination\nof efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. These\nvital milestones must be achieved to keep the global energy transition on track\nto meet Paris Agreement goals.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF POLICIES IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THESE\nAMBITIOUS TARGETS. Aside from deployment and enabling policies, structural\nchange is needed to ensure the transition to an energy-efficient economy and a\nrenewables-based power system is just and fair, and provides benefits for all.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES ENABLING MEASURES THAT GO BEYOND\nREGULATIONS OR FISCAL AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. The organisational structures of power\nsectors must be reshaped to integrate a higher share of renewables. Procurement mechanisms\nmust be designed in a way that strengthens value chains and trade, and industrial policies must\nbe fit for building resilient supply chains. Education, training, re-skilling and up-skilling should\nbe prioritised; women and under-represented groups must be empowered; and collaboration\nbetween industry, civil society, policy makers and other key stakeholders should be encouraged.\n\nEXISTING ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE EXPANDED AND MODERNISED TO\nCREATE A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM FIT FOR RENEWABLES. There is an urgent need to boost crosssector infrastructure planning, increase cross-border co-operation and develop regional power\ngrids. Action is also needed to drive grid modernisation and expansion and ensure supply-side\nflexibility and demand-side management.\n\nRENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries.\n\nWE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. Annual average investment in renewable\npower generation must reach USD 1 300 billion by 2030, compared to 486 billion in 2022. In the\ndeveloping world, we must minimise investment risks and provide access to low-cost financing.\nThe global financial architecture must be reformed to support the energy transition in the Global\nSouth. Climate-related funding from multilateral development banks must be ramped up, and\npublic capital should be redirected from the fossil fuels sector to renewable energy.\n\nTHIS WILL REQUIRE STRONG INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. Immediate efforts are\nrequired to facilitate and contribute to multilateral initiatives that promote knowledge sharing\nand capacity building to deliver a just transition whilst also safeguarding nature and biodiversity.\nCollaboration is urgently required to foster collective action on governance, climate finance and\ninnovation. North-South and South-South dialogues should be cultivated; groups like the G7 and\nG20 must mobilise support and investment; and just transition funds should be established and\noperationalised in emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its\nlatest Assessment Report (AR6), sent a clear message to the world that this\ndecade is critical to our success in limiting global surface temperature increase\nto 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (IPCC, 2023).\nThere is an urgent need for rapid and immediate action to reduce global net\nanthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by almost 50% from 2019 levels\nby 2030, with a significant proportion of this reduction occurring within the field\nof energy.\n\nHowever, the energy transition remains off-track and global greenhouse gas\nemissions have reached record levels. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels.\nThis is far below the emission reductions required to place the world on a 1.5°C\npathway. The message is clear: we cannot limit global surface temperature\nincrease to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century without\nrapid, sustained and concerted action.\n\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake (GST), through which policy\nmakers, industry, financial institutions, civil society and other stakeholders will\nreflect on the progress achieved in implementing climate pledges since the\nadoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Leveraging low-cost solar PV, onshore and offshore wind, and\nother renewable electricity generation sources, the power sector must lead the way as solutions in other\nsectors scale up. Accelerating the progress of the transition worldwide requires a holistic approach,\nbacked by systemic innovation to transform existing structures and systems built for the fossil fuel era.\n\nWhilst the phase down of fossil fuels is both essential and inevitable, it must also be responsible. The\ntransition needs to be delivered in a way that ensures energy security, accessibility and affordability,\nwhile also sustaining socio-economic development and adopting nature-positive approaches. The\nspeed at which the transition is achieved will be determined by how quickly zero-carbon alternatives can\nbe introduced and scaled up.\n\nGreater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030.\nThese goals represent some of the most important levers for change to advance the energy transition\nthis decade.\n\nThis report consolidates high-level analysis of these targets, detailing existing shortfalls and identifying\nkey enablers to resolve them. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets.\n\nThe solutions presented are technologically mature, cost-competitive and commercially available, and can\nbe scaled up rapidly in most countries around the world; indeed, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind\nare already the most cost-competitive sources of new electricity supply in most countries today (IRENA,\n2023b). Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices.\nIt would also improve air quality and reduce health costs; deliver universal access to clean affordable\nenergy; and provide greater collective security and well-being. With the right policies in place, the global\nenergy transition will also bring extensive socio-economic benefits, including in the form of job creation\nand income generation.\n\nThe key enabling frameworks, policies and recommendations detailed in this report provide concrete\nadvice to governments around the world on the necessary steps required between now and 2030 to meet\nthese targets. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIt is essential that global leaders convening at COP28 demonstrate the collective will to set a new pace for\naction this decade by committing to these targets; in short, this is a critical step in a critical decade to keep\nthe 1.5°C target within reach. This will require accelerated actions in many areas, in particular modernising\nand expanding physical energy infrastructure; improving power system operations; establishing the\nright policies and regulatory frameworks; building resilient supply chains; and developing skills and\ninstitutional capacities. These actions must be underpinned by a significant increase in public and private\nfinancing, particularly to support the developing world.\n\nTo ensure the energy transition is both just and inclusive, greater international\ncollaboration is also needed. Worldwide, around 675 million people still lack access\nto electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking methods (IEA et al., 2023).\nProviding renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n \n\n\n\n\nTOTAL GLOBAL RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY WILL NEED TO\nTRIPLE BY 2030 to reach more than 11 000 GW under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario\nin the World Energy Transitions Outlook, with solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind\npower accounting for about 90% of renewable energy capacity additions.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS MUST DOUBLE BY 2030 TO REMAIN ON\nA 1.5°C PATHWAY. In IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario this will be driven by a combination\nof efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. These\nvital milestones must be achieved to keep the global energy transition on track\nto meet Paris Agreement goals.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE MIX OF POLICIES IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THESE\nAMBITIOUS TARGETS. Aside from deployment and enabling policies, structural\nchange is needed to ensure the transition to an energy-efficient economy and a\nrenewables-based power system is just and fair, and provides benefits for all.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES ENABLING MEASURES THAT GO BEYOND\nREGULATIONS OR FISCAL AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. The organisational structures of power\nsectors must be reshaped to integrate a higher share of renewables. Procurement mechanisms\nmust be designed in a way that strengthens value chains and trade, and industrial policies must\nbe fit for building resilient supply chains. Education, training, re-skilling and up-skilling should\nbe prioritised; women and under-represented groups must be empowered; and collaboration\nbetween industry, civil society, policy makers and other key stakeholders should be encouraged.\n\nEXISTING ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE EXPANDED AND MODERNISED TO\nCREATE A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM FIT FOR RENEWABLES. There is an urgent need to boost crosssector infrastructure planning, increase cross-border co-operation and develop regional power\ngrids. Action is also needed to drive grid modernisation and expansion and ensure supply-side\nflexibility and demand-side management.\n\nRENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries.\n\nWE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. Annual average investment in renewable\npower generation must reach USD 1 300 billion by 2030, compared to 486 billion in 2022. In the\ndeveloping world, we must minimise investment risks and provide access to low-cost financing.\nThe global financial architecture must be reformed to support the energy transition in the Global\nSouth. Climate-related funding from multilateral development banks must be ramped up, and\npublic capital should be redirected from the fossil fuels sector to renewable energy.\n\nTHIS WILL REQUIRE STRONG INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. Immediate efforts are\nrequired to facilitate and contribute to multilateral initiatives that promote knowledge sharing\nand capacity building to deliver a just transition whilst also safeguarding nature and biodiversity.\nCollaboration is urgently required to foster collective action on governance, climate finance and\ninnovation. North-South and South-South dialogues should be cultivated; groups like the G7 and\nG20 must mobilise support and investment; and just transition funds should be established and\noperationalised in emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its\nlatest Assessment Report (AR6), sent a clear message to the world that this\ndecade is critical to our success in limiting global surface temperature increase\nto 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (IPCC, 2023).\nThere is an urgent need for rapid and immediate action to reduce global net\nanthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by almost 50% from 2019 levels\nby 2030, with a significant proportion of this reduction occurring within the field\nof energy.\n\nHowever, the energy transition remains off-track and global greenhouse gas\nemissions have reached record levels.

IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels.\nThis is far below the emission reductions required to place the world on a 1.5°C\npathway. The message is clear: we cannot limit global surface temperature\nincrease to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century without\nrapid, sustained and concerted action.\n\nCOP28 marks the year of the first Global Stocktake (GST), through which policy\nmakers, industry, financial institutions, civil society and other stakeholders will\nreflect on the progress achieved in implementing climate pledges since the\nadoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Leveraging low-cost solar PV, onshore and offshore wind, and\nother renewable electricity generation sources, the power sector must lead the way as solutions in other\nsectors scale up. Accelerating the progress of the transition worldwide requires a holistic approach,\nbacked by systemic innovation to transform existing structures and systems built for the fossil fuel era.\n\nWhilst the phase down of fossil fuels is both essential and inevitable, it must also be responsible. The\ntransition needs to be delivered in a way that ensures energy security, accessibility and affordability,\nwhile also sustaining socio-economic development and adopting nature-positive approaches. The\nspeed at which the transition is achieved will be determined by how quickly zero-carbon alternatives can\nbe introduced and scaled up.\n\nGreater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030.\nThese goals represent some of the most important levers for change to advance the energy transition\nthis decade.\n\nThis report consolidates high-level analysis of these targets, detailing existing shortfalls and identifying\nkey enablers to resolve them.

A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future.\n            \nDouble down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This\n            would deliver cleaner electricity systems, access to affordable energy and\n            green jobs for millions of people, billions of dollars in public and private\n            capital to foster climate-resilient growth, and reduce loss and damage for\n            nature and people wrought by harmful climate change.\n            \nTo achieve these targets, we need to dramatically ramp up wind power,\n            solar power, hydropower and geothermal power. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. On average, 1 000 GW\n            of renewables needs to be installed each year for the rest of the decade to\n            bring total renewables capacity to 11 000 GW by 2030. As the growth curve\n            will rise over the course of the decade, the renewables industry believes\n            at least 1 500 GW of renewables capacity could be installed in 2030 alone.\n            \nGlobal leaders must commit to these targets at COP28. However, progress\n            towards 2030 goals cannot be taken for granted.

As the growth curve\n            will rise over the course of the decade, the renewables industry believes\n            at least 1 500 GW of renewables capacity could be installed in 2030 alone.\n            \nGlobal leaders must commit to these targets at COP28. However, progress\n            towards 2030 goals cannot be taken for granted. Policy makers must\n            work hand-in-hand with industry and civil society to urgently implement\n            the enabling actions in this report, centred on: infrastructure and system\n            operation; policy and regulation; and supply chains, skills and capacities.\n            Critically, these areas must be reinforced by low-cost financing and\n            international collaboration.\n            \nThis is a unique “once in a generation” opportunity, but we need urgent\n            action to scale renewable energy in every region of the world. Only then\n            can we protect the planet and secure a liveable future for all.\n\nThis is the ‘make or break’ decade to avoid the most catastrophic impacts\n            of climate change. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future.\n\nDouble down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This\n            would deliver cleaner electricity systems, access to affordable energy and\n            green jobs for millions of people, billions of dollars in public and private\n            capital to foster climate-resilient growth, and reduce loss and damage for\n            nature and people wrought by harmful climate change.\n\nTo achieve these targets, we need to dramatically ramp up wind power,\n            solar power, hydropower and geothermal power. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient.

According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario identifies a technically and economically feasible pathway to an energy future that\nis consistent with Paris Agreement goals. It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system.\n\nDespite the progress achieved to date, the current deployment of energy transition technologies is\ninsufficient in speed and scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions.\n\nBy 2030, global total installed renewable power generation capacity would need to expand more than\nthree-fold, from 3 382 GW in 2022 to 11 174 GW, according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Specifically,\ninstalled solar PV capacity would rise to more than 5 400 GW, from 1 055 GW in 2022, and wind installations\nwould surpass 3 500 GW (3 040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore), up from 899 GW in 2022, over the\nsame period (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c). The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. After solar PV and\nwind power, the third-largest increase in generation capacity would be in hydropower; by 2030, global\ninstalled hydropower capacity (excluding pumped hydro) would grow by almost 17% from the 2022 level,\nreaching 1 465 GW under the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario.\n\n\nFIGURE 1 Key performance indicators for achieving the 1.5°C Scenario in the Decade for Action\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c).\n\n\nThis suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Energy storage capacity would expand in tandem, with\ncumulative global battery storage increasing by a factor of 21, from 17 GW in 2020 to 359 GW in 2030\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRenewable power additions this decade may not be linear, however, with many factors impacting the\nrate of growth. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Some projections of solar growth foresee that 1 000 GW of annual solar PV installations\nalone may be reached as soon as 2028 (Haegel et al., 2023). To meet the tripling renewable power target,\nannual renewable additions need to ramp up as fast as possible, and as early as possible, in this decade.\n\nCountries and regions will follow different trajectories in accelerating the deployment of renewable\npower capacity. Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. This will allow them to assist others by sharing\nlessons learnt, technological and technical know-how, and experiences in establishing the right\nconditions for the scaling up of renewables.\n\nUnder the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario, the global solar PV market would be dominated by G20 countries; but\noutside this group, cumulative capacity will need to surpass 900 GW by 2030, while the cumulative capacity\nin G20 countries would reach approximately 4 530 GW. For wind, China, the United States, Canada, Brazil\nand several European countries have high onshore wind potential, while the majority of expansions in\noffshore wind would be in four key markets (China, EU-27, the United States and India), accounting for\nmore than 60% of offshore wind deployment by 2030. For hydropower, G20 countries together would\naccount for 79% (over 1 150 GW) of global hydropower capacity by 2030, with almost 305 GW of total\ncapacity spread across the rest of the world.\n\nFIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. Bioenergy includes biogas, biomass\nwaste and biomass solid.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nIt is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022).\n\nAccelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nIn 2010, the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of onshore wind was\nUSD 0.107/kilowatt hour (kWh) – 95% higher than the lowest fossil fuel cost of USD 0.056/kWh. Yet,\nby 2022, the global weighted average LCOE of new onshore wind projects was USD 0.033/kWh – 52%\nlower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option, at USD 0.069/kWh (Figure 3).\n\nThis improvement was surpassed by that of solar PV, however. In 2010, solar PV had a global weighted\naverage LCOE of USD 0.445/kWh – 710% more expensive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option; but\nby 2022, a spectacular decline in costs – to USD 0.049/kWh – made solar PV’s global weighted average\nLCOE 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nFIGURE 3 Cost competitiveness of solar and wind power, 2010-2022\n\nNote: LCOE = levelised cost of electricity.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nThe global weighted-average LCOE of offshore wind fell from being 258% more expensive than the cheapest\nfossil fuel option in 2010 to being just 17% more expensive in 2022, with costs falling from USD 0.197/kWh\nto USD 0.081/kWh. Concentrated solar power (CSP) saw its global weighted average LCOE fall from 591%\nhigher than the cheapest fossil fuel option in 2010 to 71% higher in 2022 (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nWhile hydropower’s global weighted average LCOE increased in 2021-2022 to USD 0.061/kWh – largely\nowing to the development of more challenging and remote sites – it remains cheaper than new\nfossil-fuel fired options. This is also true for geothermal projects, with a global weighted-average LCOE\nof USD 0.056/kWh in 2022, as well as for bioenergy projects, at USD 0.061/kWh (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nIt is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. 2 As 2022\nshowed, the indirect economic benefits of this enhanced energy security can be significant; yet they are\ntypically not valued in current policy.\n\nFIGURE 4 Investments required to meet the 1.5°C goal\n\nSource: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nSimilarly, the economic benefits of reducing pollution, and thereby improving climate, environmental and\nhealth outcomes, are almost never properly valued in policy-setting (IRENA, 2023b). These unpriced\nbenefits significantly improve the competitiveness of renewable power and make the business case for\naccelerated deployment even more compelling.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. This represents a transformative shift in power system\nsupply dynamics and poses new challenges to power system operations. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies.\n\nIn recent years, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity – known as ‘green hydrogen’ – and its\nderivatives have been identified as industrial feedstocks for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors.\nHydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. These measures can often generate\neconomic and environmental co-benefits. A range of measures will be needed across all end-use sectors,\nincluding modal shifts from private passenger cars to collective transport, and from passenger aviation\nand road-based freight to rail, as well as the adoption of circular economy principles, improved building\ninsulation, heat pumps and efficient electric motors – especially for industrial end-use sectors.\n\nEnergy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification.\nThe electrification of end-use sectors – such as in transport and buildings – would see a rise in direct use\nof electricity in total final energy consumption from 22% in 2020 to 29% in 2030.\n\nTechnical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nTo align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). If this rate is achieved, global final energy consumption would experience\nminimal growth over the same period.\n\nWith renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made.\n\nFIGURE 5 Energy intensity: Indicators in transport and buildings in 2030\n Based on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRENEWABLE POWER\r\n \n\n\n\n\nOur success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions this decade will determine whether global temperature\nrise can be limited to 1.5°C.

Bioenergy includes biogas, biomass\nwaste and biomass solid.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nIt is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022).\n\nAccelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nIn 2010, the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of onshore wind was\nUSD 0.107/kilowatt hour (kWh) – 95% higher than the lowest fossil fuel cost of USD 0.056/kWh. Yet,\nby 2022, the global weighted average LCOE of new onshore wind projects was USD 0.033/kWh – 52%\nlower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option, at USD 0.069/kWh (Figure 3).\n\nThis improvement was surpassed by that of solar PV, however. In 2010, solar PV had a global weighted\naverage LCOE of USD 0.445/kWh – 710% more expensive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option; but\nby 2022, a spectacular decline in costs – to USD 0.049/kWh – made solar PV’s global weighted average\nLCOE 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nFIGURE 3 Cost competitiveness of solar and wind power, 2010-2022\n\nNote: LCOE = levelised cost of electricity.\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\n\nThe global weighted-average LCOE of offshore wind fell from being 258% more expensive than the cheapest\nfossil fuel option in 2010 to being just 17% more expensive in 2022, with costs falling from USD 0.197/kWh\nto USD 0.081/kWh. Concentrated solar power (CSP) saw its global weighted average LCOE fall from 591%\nhigher than the cheapest fossil fuel option in 2010 to 71% higher in 2022 (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nWhile hydropower’s global weighted average LCOE increased in 2021-2022 to USD 0.061/kWh – largely\nowing to the development of more challenging and remote sites – it remains cheaper than new\nfossil-fuel fired options. This is also true for geothermal projects, with a global weighted-average LCOE\nof USD 0.056/kWh in 2022, as well as for bioenergy projects, at USD 0.061/kWh (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nIt is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. 2 As 2022\nshowed, the indirect economic benefits of this enhanced energy security can be significant; yet they are\ntypically not valued in current policy.\n\nFIGURE 4 Investments required to meet the 1.5°C goal\n\nSource: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nSimilarly, the economic benefits of reducing pollution, and thereby improving climate, environmental and\nhealth outcomes, are almost never properly valued in policy-setting (IRENA, 2023b). These unpriced\nbenefits significantly improve the competitiveness of renewable power and make the business case for\naccelerated deployment even more compelling.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. This represents a transformative shift in power system\nsupply dynamics and poses new challenges to power system operations. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies.\n\nIn recent years, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity – known as ‘green hydrogen’ – and its\nderivatives have been identified as industrial feedstocks for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors.\nHydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage.\n\nRENEWABLE POWER\n\nOur success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions this decade will determine whether global temperature\nrise can be limited to 1.5°C. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nIRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario identifies a technically and economically feasible pathway to an energy future that\nis consistent with Paris Agreement goals. It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system.\n\nDespite the progress achieved to date, the current deployment of energy transition technologies is\ninsufficient in speed and scale to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions.\n\nBy 2030, global total installed renewable power generation capacity would need to expand more than\nthree-fold, from 3 382 GW in 2022 to 11 174 GW, according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Specifically,\ninstalled solar PV capacity would rise to more than 5 400 GW, from 1 055 GW in 2022, and wind installations\nwould surpass 3 500 GW (3 040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore), up from 899 GW in 2022, over the\nsame period (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c). The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. After solar PV and\nwind power, the third-largest increase in generation capacity would be in hydropower; by 2030, global\ninstalled hydropower capacity (excluding pumped hydro) would grow by almost 17% from the 2022 level,\nreaching 1 465 GW under the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario.\n\n\nFIGURE 1 Key performance indicators for achieving the 1.5°C Scenario in the Decade for Action\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2023a, 2023c).\n\n\nThis suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Energy storage capacity would expand in tandem, with\ncumulative global battery storage increasing by a factor of 21, from 17 GW in 2020 to 359 GW in 2030\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRenewable power additions this decade may not be linear, however, with many factors impacting the\nrate of growth. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Some projections of solar growth foresee that 1 000 GW of annual solar PV installations\nalone may be reached as soon as 2028 (Haegel et al., 2023). To meet the tripling renewable power target,\nannual renewable additions need to ramp up as fast as possible, and as early as possible, in this decade.\n\nCountries and regions will follow different trajectories in accelerating the deployment of renewable\npower capacity. Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. This will allow them to assist others by sharing\nlessons learnt, technological and technical know-how, and experiences in establishing the right\nconditions for the scaling up of renewables.\n\nUnder the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario, the global solar PV market would be dominated by G20 countries; but\noutside this group, cumulative capacity will need to surpass 900 GW by 2030, while the cumulative capacity\nin G20 countries would reach approximately 4 530 GW.

For hydropower, G20 countries together would\naccount for 79% (over 1 150 GW) of global hydropower capacity by 2030, with almost 305 GW of total\ncapacity spread across the rest of the world.\n\nIt is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022).\n\nAccelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nIn 2010, the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of onshore wind was\nUSD 0.107/kilowatt hour (kWh) – 95% higher than the lowest fossil fuel cost of USD 0.056/kWh. Yet,\nby 2022, the global weighted average LCOE of new onshore wind projects was USD 0.033/kWh – 52%\nlower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option, at USD 0.069/kWh (Figure 3).\n\nThis improvement was surpassed by that of solar PV, however. In 2010, solar PV had a global weighted\naverage LCOE of USD 0.445/kWh – 710% more expensive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option; but\nby 2022, a spectacular decline in costs – to USD 0.049/kWh – made solar PV’s global weighted average\nLCOE 29% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired option (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nThe global weighted-average LCOE of offshore wind fell from being 258% more expensive than the cheapest\nfossil fuel option in 2010 to being just 17% more expensive in 2022, with costs falling from USD 0.197/kWh\nto USD 0.081/kWh. Concentrated solar power (CSP) saw its global weighted average LCOE fall from 591%\nhigher than the cheapest fossil fuel option in 2010 to 71% higher in 2022 (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nWhile hydropower’s global weighted average LCOE increased in 2021-2022 to USD 0.061/kWh – largely\nowing to the development of more challenging and remote sites – it remains cheaper than new\nfossil-fuel fired options. This is also true for geothermal projects, with a global weighted-average LCOE\nof USD 0.056/kWh in 2022, as well as for bioenergy projects, at USD 0.061/kWh (IRENA, 2023b).\n\nIt is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. 2 As 2022\nshowed, the indirect economic benefits of this enhanced energy security can be significant; yet they are\ntypically not valued in current policy.\n\nSimilarly, the economic benefits of reducing pollution, and thereby improving climate, environmental and\nhealth outcomes, are almost never properly valued in policy-setting (IRENA, 2023b). These unpriced\nbenefits significantly improve the competitiveness of renewable power and make the business case for\naccelerated deployment even more compelling.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. This represents a transformative shift in power system\nsupply dynamics and poses new challenges to power system operations. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies.\n\nIn recent years, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity – known as ‘green hydrogen’ – and its\nderivatives have been identified as industrial feedstocks for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors.\nHydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. These measures can often generate\neconomic and environmental co-benefits. A range of measures will be needed across all end-use sectors,\nincluding modal shifts from private passenger cars to collective transport, and from passenger aviation\nand road-based freight to rail, as well as the adoption of circular economy principles, improved building\ninsulation, heat pumps and efficient electric motors – especially for industrial end-use sectors.\n\nEnergy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification.\nThe electrification of end-use sectors – such as in transport and buildings – would see a rise in direct use\nof electricity in total final energy consumption from 22% in 2020 to 29% in 2030.\n\nTechnical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a).\n\nTo align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). If this rate is achieved, global final energy consumption would experience\nminimal growth over the same period.\n\nWith renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made.\n\nFIGURE 5 Energy intensity: Indicators in transport and buildings in 2030\n Based on: (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation.

Multiple measures are required,\nincluding:\n\n\nInnovative power planning, grid expansion, modernisation and\n    enhancement, and addressing interconnection backlogs (projects\n    awaiting connection to the grid).\n    \nChanges in grid operation and management, potentially also\n    including new market design.\n    \nIncreased interconnectors between countries and regions.\n    \nGrowth in electricity storage; comprising short-duration storage\n    for increasing grid flexibility and long-duration storage to enhance\n    energy security (e.g. pumped storage).\n    \nMeasures to allow greater integration of demand-side management\n    and behind-the-meter (consumer) flexibility options (e.g. distributed\n    storage).\n    \nIntroducing other flexibility sources (e.g. green hydrogen, hybrid\n    renewable parks combining wind/solar/storage, etc.).\n    \n\n\nFIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). 4  With clarity on grid infrastructure development\nplans and reasonable guarantees on connection availability, investors will feel more confident building\nnew generation; meanwhile, consumers would be more likely to invest in electrification when a reliable\nsupply of low-cost electricity can be made available.\n\nWhen integrating higher shares of locally available variable solar and wind power, power systems will\nalso need to innovate to become: increasingly decentralised, allowing electricity to be generated at\nlocations closer to demand; and bi-directional, allowing electricity from distributed power generating\nfacilities to be injected into the grid.\n\nModernised, smarter grids are required; in the European Union (EU), around 30% of the envisaged\ninvestment in grids by 2030 could be earmarked for digitalisation 5  (European Commission, 2022).\nThey will also need to be larger and more robust. Hence, grid costs are expected to increase over time\n(IRENA, 2023a). This will require fast-tracked permitting to ensure timely investments in modern grids.\nAdding more widely distributed power generation sources will also bring resilience, especially against\nincreasingly intense extreme weather events owing to climate change (IPCC, 2023).\n\nThe electrification of transport also requires significant investments in enabling infrastructure. Electric\nvehicles will potentially account for more than 80% of all road transport activity by 2050; with 359 million\nelectric and plug-in hybrid light passenger vehicles worldwide by 2030 and 2 182 million by 2050 (IRENA,\n2023a); yet their market entry will be contingent upon coordinated investments in charging infrastructure\nand power grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure planning, timelines and assessments of investment needs for grids are aligned with long-term targets for renewable energy buildout and end-use sector decarbonisation, e.g. transport.\nMobilise funds for long-term grid investment; channel donor finance to building capacity and\n    infrastructure for integrating renewables; and streamline permitting procedures for new grid\n    infrastructure and upgrades to existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.\nDevelop modernised, decentralised (where suitable) and more resilient grid systems using\n    digitalisation, smart applications for demand-side management and interconnections with\n    neighbouring grid systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur.\nHistorically, this has been provided by pumped storage and hydropower with reservoirs.\nHowever, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). All of these technologies are undergoing rapid\ninnovation.\n\nFIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. saving energy from spring days with low loads and abundant solar to deploy\nduring high load days in the summer; or from windy autumn days to deploy during high load cloudy winter\ndays). Diverse storage technologies enhance the resilience of grids that are subject to extreme weather\nfor prolonged periods, help relieve grid congestion, provide transmission services and shore up local\narea reliability.\n\nLDES, including storage technologies spanning 10+, 24+, 100+ and 150+ hours in duration and providing\nboth power and heat, is also able to provide other grid services including black start (restarting parts\nof the grid where power has been lost in a blackout) and micro-grid level assistance for areas or key\ninfrastructure that may lose power. Storage durations can span weeks or months in the case of pumped\nstorage and reservoir hydropower. As the largest form of installed flexibility at over 175 GW worldwide,\npumped storage hydropower can play an important role in providing LDES and vital grid services, with\nsubstantial potential for off-river pumped storage to be developed in the coming decades (IHA, 2023).\nSome LDES technologies are commercially available today, while others are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Numerous companies are signing contracts (e.g. with utilities, airports, data centres,\nindustrial users, etc.) and are deploying LDES at grid-scale quantities, and pumped storage has been\nsuccessfully deployed for decades.\n\nOne emerging LDES technology is hydrogen storage. Hydrogen’s true competitive strength lies in its\nunique ability to store energy for long periods of time in large quantities. As green hydrogen displaces\nfossil fuels in some end uses, hydrogen storage could become increasingly critical to energy security,\nin the same way that natural gas storage is today in many regions. Hydrogen storage will be needed\nprimarily to meet variation in supply (rather than demand), as green hydrogen is created using VRE\nsources. Long-term hydrogen storage can play an important role in strengthening energy security and\nsystem resilience (IRENA, 2023d). Support for the continued development of these technologies is\ncritical for decarbonisation.\n\nIn many places, however, legacy market arrangements and policy frameworks do not incentivise\ninvestment in storage at scale. Action from policy makers can drive progress in this sector, such as:\nassessing energy storage and flexibility needs; setting LDES mandates for medium- and long-term\ncapacity targets; updating criteria for marketplaces; providing innovation grants and subsidies for prefeasibility studies; and establishing public-private partnerships.\n\nOther market innovations can also foster a healthy storage market, such as the introduction of congestion\nmanagement trading platforms, ancillary services markets to support the grid, and awarding additional\nvalue for features such as flexibility in capacity payments and capability to provide peaking power\n(e.g. storage technologies that can replace a natural gas peaking plant should be reflected in system\nmodelling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConduct technical assessments of system decarbonisation needs and timelines, and ensure the\n    planned buildout of renewables is complemented by storage resources of varying duration, as\n    well as other sources of flexibility.\nCollaborate with regulators and the renewables sector to enhance power market planning and\n    ensure price signals, clear targets and procurement incentivise longer duration storage.\nEncourage investment and innovation in diverse storage technologies to suit different users, such\n    as by establishing research, development and innovation (RDI) grant programmes, encouraging\n    public–private partnerships and setting medium- and long-term capacity targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-use electrification and sector coupling\nWith solar and wind power scaling up rapidly in this decade, electrification has become a vital\ndecarbonisation pathway. Green hydrogen and its derivatives, produced by electrolysers using low-cost\nrenewable power, can be used to decarbonise end-use sectors that are difficult to electrify directly –\nsuch as iron and steel making, and shipping – and to provide seasonal energy storage solutions.\n\nHowever, electrification needs to be accelerated by systemic innovation, making it not only faster but\nsmarter. Smart electrification – through sector coupling and enhanced flexibility – prevents a higher peak\nelectricity load on the power system. It also enables the power system to accommodate new loads while\nallowing integration of a higher share of variable renewable electricity in a cost-efficient manner. This\ncan help sustain renewables-based electrification without jeopardising energy system operation, thus\nmaking the power system robust and resilient. To harness all these benefits, systemic innovation should\ninvolve the entire energy value chain across four key dimensions: technology and infrastructure; market\ndesign and regulation; system planning and operation; and business models (IRENA, 2023d). Smart\ncharging for electric vehicles is a good example in this regard.\n\nSector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nThe benefit of this will be smarter, more intelligent demand-side management, achieved by deploying\nmore advanced digital technologies both behind-the-meter (by energy consumers) and in power\nsystems. Demand response would become more agile and inter-operational through sector-coupled\ntechnologies such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to smart charging\nfacilities. This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nEnd-use electrification, sector-coupling and the rapid scale-up of variable renewable electricity all\nrequire integrated cross-sectoral infrastructure planning – a process for optimising the co-development\nof increasingly connected infrastructure in various sectors. 7 The European Hotmaps project offers an\nopen-source toolbox to support public authorities, energy agencies and urban planners as they plan\nheating and cooling at local, regional and national levels. It allows users to map cooling and heating\ndemand, as well as supply, in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom, and provides renewable\nenergy generation and industrial waste heat potentials (Hotmaps, 2021). This facilitates the integration\nof heating and cooling with waste-to-energy and renewable energy, including power-to-heat. However,\nthis planning approach requires incentives for infrastructure investments where market barriers exist,\ngiven that different infrastructures operate under different legislative, regulatory and policy regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt a sector-coupling approach to the decarbonisation of economies by pursuing smart\n    electrification of the transport, buildings and industry sectors.\nCreate fora for co-ordinated planning among relevant authorities on infrastructure development,\n    including renewable energy projects, grid and transmission assets, electric vehicle charging\n    infrastructure and heat networks.\nIntroduce economic incentives for smart electrification and demand-side response (such as tax\n    credits and innovation grants) to encourage private investment in sector-coupling solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand-side management\nElectricity systems are complex; in addition to the grid infrastructure planning required to unlock the\nbenefits of sector coupling, distributed grid planning and operations will need well-defined energy\nmanagement schemes on both sides of the end-user meter. These schemes apply to both the supply side\n(power management) and demand side (load management).\nDemand-side management (DSM) comprises a set of strategies traditionally aimed at reducing peak\ndemand, which will be increasingly needed to incentivise consumption in periods of high VRE generation.\nDSM addresses various challenges, including VRE integration, rising electricity costs and environmental\nimpacts. For example, DSM can employ time-of-use pricing to encourage customers to shift electricity\nusage to off-peak hours, while demand response programmes can financially reward customers for\nreducing electricity usage during peak hours or consuming electricity during high VRE generation\nperiods. Critical-peak pricing, real-time pricing and critical-peak rebates are also among the strategies\navailable. These approaches are crucial for optimising energy efficiency in both residential and industrial\nbuildings.\nAs the transition advances, DSM will also provide flexibility to alleviate the need for more costly\nrequirements. Several challenges persist, however – particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, and other Global South regions. Notable issues include physical grid and digital technology\ninfrastructure gaps, as well as complex and inconsistent regulations and policies. Financing challenges\nalso hinder progress; attracting investment in clean energy enablers like DSM solutions requires\ninnovative financing models and incentives.\nIntelligent load control, demand response and energy efficiency are pivotal in enabling a secure and\nresilient renewables-based power system. Continued investment and innovation in these areas will\nfurther drive the adaptation of demand to supply in a renewable energy-driven future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAssess the cost-benefit of investment in DSM programmes, accounting for the energy and cost\n    savings it can provide instead of investing in grid infrastructure expansion.\nEnsure grid planning prioritises modernisation and DSM technology to close critical technology\n    gaps as infrastructure expands. Developing economies can explore innovative financing models –\n    such as blended finance – to mobilise investment in grid and DSM solutions.\nImprove data availability within the wider electricity system to enable innovation in DSM and\n    access to applications like smart meters by consumers and third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nGovernments have a crucial role to play in tripling renewable power capacity and placing the world on a\n1.5°C pathway. All too often, the energy transition discourse relegates governments’ responsibilities to\ncreating an enabling environment for private investments through predictable and stable policies, and\nthe creation of instruments that de-risk investment projects. Although this is crucial, a much broader and\nmore integrated policy approach is required to facilitate the adoption of an entire spectrum of energy\ntransition solutions needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and unlock its socio-economic benefits (Figure 8).\n\nGovernments need to be far more engaged in shaping and guiding the energy transition, including through\npolicies for ambitious public investment programmes and sufficient forward-planning for renewables\nscale-up, system integration and grid build-out.\n\nCross-cutting approaches covering all renewable technologies, electrification technologies and others\nare needed to facilitate the energy transition (e.g. energy storage), include enabling policies that set\nambitions and send clear signals to stakeholders, eliminate distortions, incentivise the uptake of solutions\nand facilitate access to affordable financing. They also include policies that ensure the integration of\nrenewables within energy systems, economies, nature and societies, as well as specific deployment\npolicies for various technologies. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand.\n\nTransitioning to a renewables-based economy may also bring challenges in the form of financing gaps,\nlabour market disruptions and energy sector insecurity. These misalignments, if not well-managed,\nrisk inequitable outcomes and a slower pace of the energy transition. Therefore, a set of structural and\njust transition policies, along with the creation of strong institutions to ensure policy co-ordination and\ncohesion, is required to manage potential misalignments.\n\nFinally, a holistic global policy framework that entails international collaboration including North-South\nand South-South co-operation is needed to bring stakeholders from countries around the world together\nto commit to a just transition that leaves no one behind and strengthens international finance flows,\ncapacities and technologies in an equitable manner.\n\nThis section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nFIGURE 8 The IRENA holistic policy framework for a just and inclusive energy transition\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2021b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Enhanced energy efficiency is a crucial enabler for making high\nlevels of end-use electrification feasible and affordable. Measures related to reducing energy demand\nand improving efficiency are needed across all end-use sectors.\n\nMinimum energy performance standards (MEPS) can support industrial, commercial and residential\nusers to procure and switch to more energy efficient appliances or equipment such as electric heating/\ncooling technologies. Building codes can set energy performance requirements by specifying insulation\nstandards, thereby reducing heating and cooling demands. They can also specify greenhouse gas\nemission targets and carbon footprints. For renovation, in particular, codes can be coupled with financial\nincentives.\n\nIt is also important to address prevailing challenges associated with building ownership structures,\nequitable access and benefit-sharing of energy efficiency investments and policies. “Green loans” could\ncarry lower interest rates and protect low-income energy consumers from energy price fluctuations\nand inflationary environments. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.\n\nIn the transport sector, significant improvements can be achieved by promoting energy efficient mobility\n(e.g. public transport such as railways, metros and buses, and car-sharing), as well as active (nonmotorised) transport such as cycling and walking in urban areas. Public campaigns can be undertaken by\nnational and local governments to encourage green mobility modes. Other policies, such as differentiated\nparking fees and highway tolls, can encourage a shift to public transport, complemented by dedicated\ndriving lanes for car-sharing. Public transportation fleets also offer the opportunity to utilise costcompetitive renewable fuels or electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement with specific time horizons and outline\n    clear avenues for implementation.\n    \nStrengthen regulatory frameworks, including building codes that specify low energy performance\n    and appliance energy efficiency standards.\n    \nExpand the availability of financial incentives and affordable lending schemes for meeting\n    standards on energy efficiency, such as tax credits or green loans with favourable interest rates\n    for building renovation or modernisation.\n    \nEstablish public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy efficiency measures, public\n    transport and green mobility for cost savings and collective decarbonisation goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket incentives and fiscal policy\nWhile renewables have become increasingly competitive, they still face barriers compared to fossil fuels.\nRising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective. The choice of instrument and its design should consider: the nature of the solution\n(e.g. utility-scale, distributed, off-grid); level of development of the sector; power system organisational\nstructure; wider macroeconomic environment (e.g. impact of inflation and commodity price volatility);\nand broader policy objectives. It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below). This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk. A mechanism to allow for bilateral power\nprocurement between generators and private off-takers (such as industrial actors or corporates) can\nfurther strengthen the case for large deployment volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments.\n    \nIntroduce tax credits, levies and/or exemptions on import/export duties for key materials and\n    components in the renewable energy supply chain.\n    \nEnsure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains.\n    \nConsider the trade-offs between ‘lowest-price’ objectives, and other policy outcomes such as\n    socio-economic development, system integration and industry sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower market design and regulation\nThe world is entering a new era in which electricity systems will be increasingly dominated by zeromarginal-cost renewable technologies. Power markets must evolve and adapt to new market forces,\nsuch as corporate and industrial demand, and behind-the-meter (prosumer) generation. They must be\norganised in a way that incentivises new investment in renewable power generation and the flexibility to\nprovide reliable electricity at a level required for the 1.5°C pathway. This requires governments and other\nstakeholders to undertake a close examination of their power systems’ organisational structures, i.e. the\ninstitutions, processes and arrangements through which electricity services are exchanged and rewarded.\n\nWholesale power markets today are based on marginal cost pricing, where the most expensive\ngenerator (with the highest variable cost – typically fossil fuel-fired plants) determines electricity\nprices for the time period in which the market operates. This poses a number of challenges. As the\nshare of renewable power grows, wholesale spot markets will see increased price volatility, as periods\nof high renewable power generation push clearing prices in the wholesale market close to zero. When\nrenewable generation is less than demand, flexibility resources will be needed, potentially resulting in\nvery high prices at certain times.\n\nIf wholesale markets are the main source of revenue, the economic feasibility of new investments will\nplummet, as even existing generators will struggle to recover their initial capital costs whilst prospective\ninvestors realise diminishing returns. The paradigm that relies on free markets to incentivise power\nsupply investment decisions therefore needs to change.\n\nUltimately, a renewables-based power system requires enhanced flexibility; wholesale market design\nmust deliver this as well as providing the volume of renewable power needed. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.\n\nPower system organisational structures must evolve to better align with energy policy and\ndecarbonisation goals. A “dual procurement” power market design could introduce long-term\ncontract mechanisms (e.g. Auctions, CfDs, PPAs) as the backbone of renewable power procurement,\nalongside a short-term market to dispatch flexible resources in an affordable way (IRENA, 2022a).\nThis holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system.\n\nThis transformation is partially underway, as auctions are becoming the preferred tool to procure\nrenewable energy, and wholesale markets are becoming more time and location granular (IRENA,\n2023a); but there are meaningful actions authorities can take now to ensure the acceleration of this trend.\n\nOne way to achieve enhanced system flexibility is for power markets to allow flexibility technologies\n(such as batteries and pumped hydropower) to provide ancillary services and be rewarded accordingly.\nAncillary services that serve to stabilise the grid network and will become increasingly important as\ndispatchable fossil fuel-based generation is phased out of the power mix. Today, many power systems\nreward the provision of energy but not ancillary services (where these services are not included in\ncontractual obligations). They therefore need to be appropriately valued and reflected in power system\ndesign. Valuing, pricing and procuring ancillary services astutely can bring new players to the grid, with\nadvantages for the whole power system. Examples of this include the enhanced frequency regulation\nauctions in the UK.\n\nTo achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This includes growth in distributed renewable energy\ngeneration systems – notably using solar PV – but also community solar and wind projects. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. Such measures can maximise the socio-economic benefits of renewable energy, insulate consumers from price volatility, create local supply\nchains and job opportunities, and enhance public perceptions of renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors.\nDesign auctions that balance competitive price discovery and long-term delivery of affordable\n    electricity. Auctions should also be run for sufficiently large and ambitious volumes, with\n    consistent, transparent tendering schedules to effectively foster competitive bidding.\nCreate a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix.\nRethink participation rules to allow new technologies to engage in the power market as flexibility\n    providers, including storage and demand side aggregators.\nEncourage investment in distributed renewable energy systems that allow consumers to become\n    “prosumers” by both using and producing clean electricity.\nReorganise power market structures to ensure policies for accelerating renewables deployment\n    account for system flexibility as well as sustainable returns to generators and investors.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamlining permitting\nThe time and cost constraints imposed by permitting procedures represent a major bottleneck\nimpacting the deployment of renewable energy projects in many countries. It is essential that permitting\nprocedures are fit-for-purpose and keep pace with renewable and climate targets, without compromising\nenvironmental and social impact standards. Experiences from the public and private sectors indicate\nthat best practices in permitting centre on four areas: administrative consolidation; digitalisation; policy\nsupport; and public engagement (European Commission, 2023).\n\nRenewable energy developers often need to consult numerous authorities at national, sub-national and\nsometimes village or prefecture level for the necessary permits to build a project. This process can be\nlengthy and extremely bureaucratic; for instance, the global average time required for permitting an\noffshore wind project is nine years. Onshore wind and utility-scale PV permitting processes can also\nbe long, although they are typically shorter than those for offshore wind. Similar obstacles exist for\nhydropower projects and smaller scale distributed projects for end consumers using renewable energy\ntechnologies like rooftop solar.\n\nCreating dedicated, centralised authorities is one way to streamline this process by ensuring developers\ncan refer to a single focal point. Countries like Denmark and the Philippines have already adopted a “one-stop shop” model to accelerate renewables deployment, but this model only works if it is adequately\nresourced. In addition, digitalised processes to submit and track applications would enable developments\nto progress more efficiently, while access to digitised local consenting and historical dispute records\nwould allow developers and authorities to screen sites that could be high-risk or unsuitable at an early\nstage (IRENA, 2023h).\n\nAn overarching best practice is the introduction of legislation mandating a maximum lead time for the\npermitting of renewable energy projects. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. Gaining social acceptance through\npublic engagement with relevant stakeholders is critical in the consenting and constructing stages of a\nrenewable energy project. This includes early and continuous consultation by authorities and developers\nwith local communities to communicate the benefits and considerations brought by a project to the area,\nas well as a transparent conflict resolution mechanism that sincerely addresses community concerns.\n\nComprehensive and efficient permitting frameworks represent a clear win-win, allowing renewable\nenergy development to expand this decade while cultivating acceptance with other interests in land and\nsea spaces. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023).\n\nRecent studies indicate that adopting best practices in permitting could cut consenting time for utility-scale wind and solar projects by more than half; for example, onshore wind farms could be permitted in\none year, offshore wind farms in 1.5 years and solar farms in as little as three months (ETC, 2023). This\nmakes permitting a high-impact enabler for the energy transition, where the necessary investment in\nresource, policy support and capacity will bring enormous value to countries in accelerating renewables\ngrowth and securing associated socio-economic and environmental benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023).\n\nThe energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. If not well managed, these\nmisalignments risk inequitable outcomes, which could sow doubt among policy makers and the\npublic concerning the advantages of the transition and lead to a fractured and unco-ordinated policy\nenvironment. Hence, there is a need for policies and measures that equitably distribute the benefits of\nthe energy transition and raise public awareness about these positive impacts.\n\nIn terms of jobs, sectoral misalignments may arise due to potential shifts in value and supply chains\nduring the energy transition. For instance, transitioning from fossil fuel power generation to solar energy\nmay shift the focus from fuel extraction to the semi-conductor industry. The impact on employment\ndepends on factors such as domestic production and labour productivity. Labour-market interventions\nencompass adequate employment services attuned to evolving circumstances and needs, along with\nmeasures to facilitate labour mobility (IRENA and ILO, 2023).\n\nCommunity benefit schemes span countries from Costa Rica to Mali and adopt a range of structures,\nfrom shared ownership of renewable assets to industry sponsorship of critical social and economic\ninfrastructure in host communities (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2020). Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions.\n\nAligning policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition will facilitate local\nvalue creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, and on a larger scale, ensure political\nand social stability as renewable energy expands.\n\nAs part of a sensitive and efficient permitting framework, renewable development must be well integrated\nwith the principles of sustainability, circular economy and reduced environmental impact – particularly\non land use and biodiversity. This also applies to enabling infrastructure, with grid expansion into remote\nand biodiverse areas requiring careful siting.\n\nAdopting sustainable end-of-life management policies, including waste management legislation, can\nhelp countries prepare for the anticipated volumes of equipment waste such as solar PV panels and\nbatteries. Research and development programmes across the energy and waste sectors, and industrial\nclusters, can help to further scale waste management infrastructure on a national or regional basis\n(IRENA and IEA, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition and foster local\n    value creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, with a special focus on the\n    inclusion of marginalised groups.\nAnticipate labour market disruptions and establish programmes that can address workforce\n    gaps, minimise labour misalignments, create opportunities for targeted recruitment and labour\n    mobility, such as relocation grants, and establish social protection programmes.\nMinimise adverse environmental impacts and encourage nature-positive approaches, for example\n    by incentivising the uptake of sustainability standards for new renewable energy assets – such as\n    the Hydropower Sustainability Standard – as part of procurement schemes.\nEnsure the impacts of mining activities and the use of relatively scarce components are mitigated\n    through provisions for circular economy (end-of-life management, recycling and reuse of materials).\nGather information on renewables’ waste production through regular monitoring of waste\n    produced by technology, the composition of waste streams, installed system performance and the\n    causes and frequency of system failures, in order to adopt waste minimisation legislation suitable\n    for the pace and scale of the transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\r\n \n\n\n\n\nBuilding resilient supply chains\nThe vulnerabilities of key energy industries to logistics bottlenecks, commodity price volatility, trade\nbarriers, and commodity and component import dependencies have become increasingly apparent in\nrecent years. Energy supply chains have become a priority agenda for policy makers, as demand and\ncompetition for critical raw materials, rare earth elements and production capacity become more acute.\n\nWithout well-functioning and cost-efficient industrial supply chains, the energy transition will not\nmaterialise. If not well managed, competition, security and scarcity challenges in renewable energy\nsupply chains could lead to a disorderly transition, characterised by slower rates of renewables\ndeployment at inflated costs. A mismatch between supply and demand for several critical minerals is\nalready evident, with particularly high levels observed for lithium – a key material required for the shortduration energy storage and electric transport sectors (IRENA, 2023e). Bottlenecks for key components\nin the wind industry – e.g. nacelles, blades and gearboxes – are set to emerge by the second half of this\ndecade in Asia and the Americas (GWEC, 2023). High concentration risk in the global renewables supply\nchain also raises the prospect of price or security of supply uncertainty in the future.\n\nRobust and resilient global supply chains are required to support a 1.5°C pathway. The mining and\nprocessing of critical materials including lithium, copper, nickel and other rare earth metals are\nconstrained within specific geographies, exposing these supply chains to geopolitical tensions and\nconcentration risks (IRENA, 2023e). Policy makers should work with the private sector to identify\nproduction gaps and supply chain weaknesses on a national and regional basis, and generate strategies\nto reinforce supply chain security.\n\nSocially responsible procurement is another key issue, where many critical materials and components\nrefined or manufactured in one country are imported by others for use in the renewables sector. It will\nbe vital to ensure supply chains – in the mining and processing segments in particular – are managed\nwith respect to fair trade, and high environmental, social governance (ESG) and sustainability standards.\nResilient supply chains are also key to sustaining the cost-value proposition of renewable energy around\nthe world.\n\nAs countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. The need for local value creation and regional supply chain\ninvestment must be carefully balanced with reducing trade barriers for goods and services central to\nthe renewables renewables industry. This will be key to avoid intensifying supply chain bottlenecks\nand making renewables less cost-competitive, while maximising socio-economic benefits.\n\nMultilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. This will require governments to work with industry, civil society and other stakeholders to\nensure supply chain planning is conducted through a wider lens that encompasses national interests,\ncost-effective and socially responsible sourcing, long-term social and environmental sustainability, and\nclimate and renewable energy targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate with the renewables industry on industrial development reviews and plans for the\n    transition that are sustainable, achievable, and adequately mitigate risk of supply insecurity\n    and price volatility. Approaches include diversifying sources of production, anticipating critical\n    production gaps and localising value chains.\nEnsure socially responsible procurement of renewables by encouraging uptake of sustainable\n    supply chain assurance schemes, such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative.\nIncentivise public–private partnerships and investment in circularity to encourage reuse of\n    materials and a circular economy approach to project development, which can help to reduce\n    concentration risk and supply insecurity of critical materials.\nCo-operate with international fora and financial institutions to safeguard international trade\n    corridors for materials and components for key renewable energy technologies.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation, training and capacity-building\nBuilding a skilled energy transition workforce requires measures to both expand the talent pipeline and\nenhance the quality of education and training provisions.\n\nEarly exposure to renewable energy topics and careers is vital for sparking interest in pursuing a career in the\nsector, but also to increase social acceptance by a knowledgeable citizenry. The curricula at higher education\nand vocational training institutions must reflect the skills and competences required by the transition.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the content of education and training programmes, it is also important to\nenhance the instructional methods used. For example, experiential learning methods where students are\nencouraged to develop problem-solving strategies can help to prepare learners for jobs in the constantly\nevolving renewable energy sector, where independent knowledge-seeking will often be necessary.\n\nFacilitating collaboration between government agencies on workforce development, industry and\neducational institutions will contribute to more co-ordinated skill-matching efforts. It is vital to consider\nhow a just transition can respond to potential labour displacement in the existing energy sector workforce\nand re-skill or upskill appropriately.\n\nTargeted measures to train, recruit and retain women and other underrepresented or marginalised groups\n(including older workers, ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities and those on a low\nincome) will ensure the dividends of the transition are enjoyed by all. This inclusion can be implemented\nthrough early exposure to renewable energy leadership and career pathways, targeted scholarships,\ngovernment-funded training opportunities, and industry apprenticeship and mentorship schemes.\n\nOutside the renewables industry, it is equally important to ensure sufficiently skilled and trained workers\nare available in government departments concerned with international trade, supply chains, electric\ncharging infrastructure and land use. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government.\n\nCarefully designed public-private partnerships (PPPs) can also play a crucial role in improving overall\ntraining quality while meeting sectoral labour requirements, promoting national skill standards and\nmatchmaking communities with workplace training opportunities. In addition to improving training\ncontent, PPPs can also play a role in shifting the financing of training provisions to a more integrated\napproach that incorporates multiple funding mechanisms including payroll-based training levies, tax\nincentives, scholarships and donations, vouchers and student loans (Dunbar, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign workforce planning among all stakeholders, including labour agencies, labour unions, the\n    wider energy industry and educational institutions, to identify critical skill gaps and workforce\n    needs in advance, and to design skill-building strategies accordingly.\nProvide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition.\nEnsure energy transition goals are reflected in educational programmes and resources, such\n    as university curricula, vocational training institutions, occupational health and safety training\n    institutions, and professional education programmes.\nBuild the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce.\nInvest in reskilling and upskilling measures for vulnerable communities and those in fossil fuel\n    industries to ensure the employment benefits of the transition are extended to a wide subset of\n    the population. Such measures need to be embedded in broader regional economic revitalisation\n    programmes and investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). However, investments remain focused on a few technologies and concentrated\nin a limited number of countries. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). This trend is reflected in renewable power\ncapacity additions, as all of Africa accounted for less than 2% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA,\n2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023).\n\nTo achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. It is equally important that investments to modernise power grids and enhance operational flexibility\nincrease from the annual average investment of USD 274 billion in 2022 to USD 605 billion by 2030. 10 \n\nThis presents a dual challenge: 1) how to scale existing investment flows in countries and technologies;\nand 2) how to ensure these investment flows reach countries that are currently underserved by the\nenergy transition. Efforts to address the much higher cost of capital faced by developing economies –\nas much as three to five times more than in most OECD countries – are also needed (IRENA, 2023f). A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects.\n\nRepurposing public capital from the fossil fuel sector, including both direct investments and financial\nsupport in the form of subsidies, can help accelerate progress towards unlocking the capital required.\nThis public money can then catalyse private capital flows, amplifying investment efforts towards the\nUSD 35 trillion required (for the energy transition as a whole) in the remainder of this decade.\n\nFor example, public financial flows to fossil fuels in the G20 countries alone reached USD 1.4 trillion in\n2022 – more than double 2019 levels. Moreover, G20 governments supported the global fossil fuel industry\nthrough international aid, export credit support and concessional financing (such as equity, grants, loans\nand loan guarantees) at an average of USD 50 billion per year from 2019 to 2021 (IISD, 2023).\n\nPublic funding is urgently needed for basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to\ndrive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as industry and transport,\nor synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investment is scarce. Without this, the gap in\ninvestment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen, to the detriment of\nbillions of people and the success of a just and inclusive global energy transition.\n\nA more comprehensive definition of risk around investing in energy assets is needed. A narrow focus on\nthe return risk to investors must expand to encompass environmental and social risks. This approach,\nwhich should be exercised through rigorous international benchmarks and protocols for investment,\ncan also help to shift funding from fossil fuel assets to the renewables sector. With limited public funds\navailable in the developing world, the international community must step up.\n\nPublic funds (domestic or through international collaboration) must flow through intermediaries\n(e.g. governments, development finance institutions and global funds such as the Green Climate Fund).\nSuch instruments should channel public funds towards policies that support structural change and a\njust transition. Furthermore, these instruments should be designed progressively to ensure economic\nbenefits are shared in an equitable way.\n\nFinally, public investments are needed for economic interventions to support a more equitable\ndistribution of benefits from large-scale renewables growth. National carbon pricing revenues,\nfor example, could be redirected to support clean, affordable electricity access for lower-income\nhouseholds on a progressive basis.\n\nIt is also important to actively engage the private sector, given that public financing alone will not be\nanywhere near sufficient to address the huge investment needs for the global energy transition. The public\nsector can play a catalysing role by providing a conducive and predictable enabling environment for the\nlong-term investment decisions made in the private sector. Also, governments can set the right conditions\nfor private sector actors to build and finance a viable pipeline of energy transition-oriented projects.\n\nFor example, blended finance structures would allow concessional public finance, and even philanthropic\ngrant-based finance, to improve the risk-return profile of an investment, so that private capital is\nattracted at lower cost and/or better terms (IRENA, 2023g). Banks can also pool loans to relatively\nsmall renewables projects into a securitised product aimed at impact-minded investors, including retail\ninvestors who otherwise have few avenues to earn returns while funding renewables deployment (GFMA\nand BCG, 2020). The resulting financial portfolio of projects would reduce the perceived risk associated\nwith its individual components. Such an approach would require a level of contract standardisation to\nenable the bundling of small projects (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nWhile there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. In addition to the measures described above, capital mobilisation schemes like green\nbonds for renewables, as well as international coalition-building to guide distribution of renewables\ninvestment between the Global North and Global South, will be crucial to ensure renewables can\nequitably scale this decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation).\n    \nPromote the adoption of a comprehensive definition of investment risk within public and private\n    institutions that encompasses environmental and social externalities, thereby aligning financial\n    decision-making with broader public and social goals.\n    \nCollaborate with public and private sector actors to develop innovative, context-specific financing\n    and business models that address renewable energy financing gaps in underinvested countries.\n    This involves utilising blended finance, green bonds, financial aggregation, and innovative risk\n    mitigation tools tailored to each country’s unique needs.\n    \nDirect the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access.\n    \nFor Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. A fractured and unaligned approach to renewables deployment will lead\nto missed opportunities for countries to accelerate growth and enjoy the benefits of clean electricity,\nparticularly in the Global South. Public and private stakeholders alike are responsible for enhancing\nparticipation in multilateral initiatives that can facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building to\ndeliver a just transition via a 1.5°C pathway.\n\nWith the lion’s share of renewables investment benefiting developed economies, it will be important to\nstrengthen North-South and South-South collaboration to maximise the social and economic benefits\nfrom clean industrialisation. Country blocs such as the G20 can be powerful coalitions to mobilise support\nand investment around the global renewable energy target and its key enablers.\n\nMobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables.\n\nAdvanced economies are better positioned to mobilise public financing, but global policy frameworks are\nnecessary to secure affordable funding to underpin the energy transition at the national level elsewhere. In\nemerging economies, just transition funds need to be established to support plant closures, communities\nin transition, repurposing/rehabilitation, and retraining and skilling, among other priorities. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. A high proportion of the public funding mobilised will need to\nbe grant-based, avoiding the danger of adding to already high debt burdens faced by many countries.\n\nInternational climate finance has a key role to play in providing the public financing necessary for a just and\nfair energy transition. Its function will vary depending on the context; fossil fuel-dependent communities\nand countries will require targeted efforts to unwind lock-ins to the fossil fuel economy and plan an\nalternative development trajectory based on renewable power generation and economic activities (CPR,\n2021). Countries where mitigation requirements consistent with climate targets go beyond their fair\nshare of the global mitigation burden will require support to trigger the needed collaborative framework,\nleapfrog to renewables-based energy systems and reap their share of the transition benefits.\n\nIt will be important to ensure definitions, standards, governance and investment protocols for the\nenergy transition are fairly aligned to effectively funnel capital to renewables development that meets\nhigh social and environmental standards. From green taxonomy to emissions reduction standards, the\nneed for common ground in the renewables and green hydrogen sectors will be increasingly helpful for\nmultinational investors, companies and civil society actors to navigate the transition.\n\nInternational collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. There are many areas for continued innovation and learning, from DSM\nto LDES to green hydrogen derivatives – all of which will have a positive impact on decarbonisation.\nPlatforms for knowledge-sharing and imparting lessons learnt, such as the IRENA Collaborative Frameworks or the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), are important vehicles to ensure ambition\ncan be transformed into effective action at country level. This is particularly important for those countries\nthat are most vulnerable to the severe impacts of climate change, and so face more significant challenges\nto protect communities without adequate support for adaptation measures (UNCTAD, 2022).\n\nFinally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy.\nThe ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). Scaling up grid planning will support a more economic and\nsustainable approach to the transition, enabling better system balancing and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. This requires public-private platforms that bring governments together with financial institutions, renewable energy\n    developers and supply chain actors, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.\n    \nEnsure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth.\nEncourage robust standards and investment protocols for the transition that can allocate capital\n    to high-impact solutions in the renewables sector. This includes strict emissions standards as part\n    of green taxonomies to guide a capital shift away from fossil fuels and accelerate the development\n    of a green hydrogen sector.\nParticipate in platforms for knowledge-sharing and exchange on renewable energy research,\n    innovation and best practices across policy areas including auction design and corporate\n    procurement. Technology exchange and harmonised standards can also build the resilience of\n    the global renewable energy supply chain by achieving cost efficiencies, supporting best-in-class\n    asset development and lowering barriers to market.\nIntensify co-operation with neighbouring governments and grid authorities on regional grid\n    planning and opportunities for building interconnections, cross-border power trading, regional\n    power pools and innovative approaches like meshed grids.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants.\nThis will require enhancements to – and expansion of – current power\ngrid systems, and the modernisation and upgrading of power system\noperations.\n\nWith VRE sources becoming the major source of power in a\n1.5°C-compatible world, countries must start upgrading and\nexpanding their power grid infrastructure to prepare for increasing\nend-use sector electrification. Multiple measures are required,\nincluding:\n\n\nInnovative power planning, grid expansion, modernisation and\n    enhancement, and addressing interconnection backlogs (projects\n    awaiting connection to the grid).\n    \nChanges in grid operation and management, potentially also\n    including new market design.\n    \nIncreased interconnectors between countries and regions.\n    \nGrowth in electricity storage; comprising short-duration storage\n    for increasing grid flexibility and long-duration storage to enhance\n    energy security (e.g. pumped storage).\n    \nMeasures to allow greater integration of demand-side management\n    and behind-the-meter (consumer) flexibility options (e.g. distributed\n    storage).\n    \nIntroducing other flexibility sources (e.g. green hydrogen, hybrid\n    renewable parks combining wind/solar/storage, etc.).\n    \n\n\nFIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). 4  With clarity on grid infrastructure development\nplans and reasonable guarantees on connection availability, investors will feel more confident building\nnew generation; meanwhile, consumers would be more likely to invest in electrification when a reliable\nsupply of low-cost electricity can be made available.\n\nWhen integrating higher shares of locally available variable solar and wind power, power systems will\nalso need to innovate to become: increasingly decentralised, allowing electricity to be generated at\nlocations closer to demand; and bi-directional, allowing electricity from distributed power generating\nfacilities to be injected into the grid.\n\nModernised, smarter grids are required; in the European Union (EU), around 30% of the envisaged\ninvestment in grids by 2030 could be earmarked for digitalisation 5  (European Commission, 2022).\nThey will also need to be larger and more robust. Hence, grid costs are expected to increase over time\n(IRENA, 2023a). This will require fast-tracked permitting to ensure timely investments in modern grids.\nAdding more widely distributed power generation sources will also bring resilience, especially against\nincreasingly intense extreme weather events owing to climate change (IPCC, 2023).\n\nThe electrification of transport also requires significant investments in enabling infrastructure. Electric\nvehicles will potentially account for more than 80% of all road transport activity by 2050; with 359 million\nelectric and plug-in hybrid light passenger vehicles worldwide by 2030 and 2 182 million by 2050 (IRENA,\n2023a); yet their market entry will be contingent upon coordinated investments in charging infrastructure\nand power grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure planning, timelines and assessments of investment needs for grids are aligned with long-term targets for renewable energy buildout and end-use sector decarbonisation, e.g. transport.\nMobilise funds for long-term grid investment; channel donor finance to building capacity and\n    infrastructure for integrating renewables; and streamline permitting procedures for new grid\n    infrastructure and upgrades to existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.\nDevelop modernised, decentralised (where suitable) and more resilient grid systems using\n    digitalisation, smart applications for demand-side management and interconnections with\n    neighbouring grid systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur.\nHistorically, this has been provided by pumped storage and hydropower with reservoirs.\nHowever, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). All of these technologies are undergoing rapid\ninnovation.\n\nFIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. saving energy from spring days with low loads and abundant solar to deploy\nduring high load days in the summer; or from windy autumn days to deploy during high load cloudy winter\ndays). Diverse storage technologies enhance the resilience of grids that are subject to extreme weather\nfor prolonged periods, help relieve grid congestion, provide transmission services and shore up local\narea reliability.\n\nLDES, including storage technologies spanning 10+, 24+, 100+ and 150+ hours in duration and providing\nboth power and heat, is also able to provide other grid services including black start (restarting parts\nof the grid where power has been lost in a blackout) and micro-grid level assistance for areas or key\ninfrastructure that may lose power. Storage durations can span weeks or months in the case of pumped\nstorage and reservoir hydropower. As the largest form of installed flexibility at over 175 GW worldwide,\npumped storage hydropower can play an important role in providing LDES and vital grid services, with\nsubstantial potential for off-river pumped storage to be developed in the coming decades (IHA, 2023).\nSome LDES technologies are commercially available today, while others are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Numerous companies are signing contracts (e.g. with utilities, airports, data centres,\nindustrial users, etc.) and are deploying LDES at grid-scale quantities, and pumped storage has been\nsuccessfully deployed for decades.\n\nOne emerging LDES technology is hydrogen storage. Hydrogen’s true competitive strength lies in its\nunique ability to store energy for long periods of time in large quantities. As green hydrogen displaces\nfossil fuels in some end uses, hydrogen storage could become increasingly critical to energy security,\nin the same way that natural gas storage is today in many regions. Hydrogen storage will be needed\nprimarily to meet variation in supply (rather than demand), as green hydrogen is created using VRE\nsources. Long-term hydrogen storage can play an important role in strengthening energy security and\nsystem resilience (IRENA, 2023d). Support for the continued development of these technologies is\ncritical for decarbonisation.\n\nIn many places, however, legacy market arrangements and policy frameworks do not incentivise\ninvestment in storage at scale. Action from policy makers can drive progress in this sector, such as:\nassessing energy storage and flexibility needs; setting LDES mandates for medium- and long-term\ncapacity targets; updating criteria for marketplaces; providing innovation grants and subsidies for prefeasibility studies; and establishing public-private partnerships.\n\nOther market innovations can also foster a healthy storage market, such as the introduction of congestion\nmanagement trading platforms, ancillary services markets to support the grid, and awarding additional\nvalue for features such as flexibility in capacity payments and capability to provide peaking power\n(e.g. storage technologies that can replace a natural gas peaking plant should be reflected in system\nmodelling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConduct technical assessments of system decarbonisation needs and timelines, and ensure the\n    planned buildout of renewables is complemented by storage resources of varying duration, as\n    well as other sources of flexibility.\nCollaborate with regulators and the renewables sector to enhance power market planning and\n    ensure price signals, clear targets and procurement incentivise longer duration storage.\nEncourage investment and innovation in diverse storage technologies to suit different users, such\n    as by establishing research, development and innovation (RDI) grant programmes, encouraging\n    public–private partnerships and setting medium- and long-term capacity targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-use electrification and sector coupling\nWith solar and wind power scaling up rapidly in this decade, electrification has become a vital\ndecarbonisation pathway. Green hydrogen and its derivatives, produced by electrolysers using low-cost\nrenewable power, can be used to decarbonise end-use sectors that are difficult to electrify directly –\nsuch as iron and steel making, and shipping – and to provide seasonal energy storage solutions.\n\nHowever, electrification needs to be accelerated by systemic innovation, making it not only faster but\nsmarter. Smart electrification – through sector coupling and enhanced flexibility – prevents a higher peak\nelectricity load on the power system. It also enables the power system to accommodate new loads while\nallowing integration of a higher share of variable renewable electricity in a cost-efficient manner. This\ncan help sustain renewables-based electrification without jeopardising energy system operation, thus\nmaking the power system robust and resilient. To harness all these benefits, systemic innovation should\ninvolve the entire energy value chain across four key dimensions: technology and infrastructure; market\ndesign and regulation; system planning and operation; and business models (IRENA, 2023d). Smart\ncharging for electric vehicles is a good example in this regard.\n\nSector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nThe benefit of this will be smarter, more intelligent demand-side management, achieved by deploying\nmore advanced digital technologies both behind-the-meter (by energy consumers) and in power\nsystems. Demand response would become more agile and inter-operational through sector-coupled\ntechnologies such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to smart charging\nfacilities. This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nEnd-use electrification, sector-coupling and the rapid scale-up of variable renewable electricity all\nrequire integrated cross-sectoral infrastructure planning – a process for optimising the co-development\nof increasingly connected infrastructure in various sectors. 7 The European Hotmaps project offers an\nopen-source toolbox to support public authorities, energy agencies and urban planners as they plan\nheating and cooling at local, regional and national levels. It allows users to map cooling and heating\ndemand, as well as supply, in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom, and provides renewable\nenergy generation and industrial waste heat potentials (Hotmaps, 2021). This facilitates the integration\nof heating and cooling with waste-to-energy and renewable energy, including power-to-heat. However,\nthis planning approach requires incentives for infrastructure investments where market barriers exist,\ngiven that different infrastructures operate under different legislative, regulatory and policy regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt a sector-coupling approach to the decarbonisation of economies by pursuing smart\n    electrification of the transport, buildings and industry sectors.\nCreate fora for co-ordinated planning among relevant authorities on infrastructure development,\n    including renewable energy projects, grid and transmission assets, electric vehicle charging\n    infrastructure and heat networks.\nIntroduce economic incentives for smart electrification and demand-side response (such as tax\n    credits and innovation grants) to encourage private investment in sector-coupling solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand-side management\nElectricity systems are complex; in addition to the grid infrastructure planning required to unlock the\nbenefits of sector coupling, distributed grid planning and operations will need well-defined energy\nmanagement schemes on both sides of the end-user meter. These schemes apply to both the supply side\n(power management) and demand side (load management).\nDemand-side management (DSM) comprises a set of strategies traditionally aimed at reducing peak\ndemand, which will be increasingly needed to incentivise consumption in periods of high VRE generation.\nDSM addresses various challenges, including VRE integration, rising electricity costs and environmental\nimpacts. For example, DSM can employ time-of-use pricing to encourage customers to shift electricity\nusage to off-peak hours, while demand response programmes can financially reward customers for\nreducing electricity usage during peak hours or consuming electricity during high VRE generation\nperiods. Critical-peak pricing, real-time pricing and critical-peak rebates are also among the strategies\navailable. These approaches are crucial for optimising energy efficiency in both residential and industrial\nbuildings.\nAs the transition advances, DSM will also provide flexibility to alleviate the need for more costly\nrequirements. Several challenges persist, however – particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, and other Global South regions. Notable issues include physical grid and digital technology\ninfrastructure gaps, as well as complex and inconsistent regulations and policies. Financing challenges\nalso hinder progress; attracting investment in clean energy enablers like DSM solutions requires\ninnovative financing models and incentives.\nIntelligent load control, demand response and energy efficiency are pivotal in enabling a secure and\nresilient renewables-based power system. Continued investment and innovation in these areas will\nfurther drive the adaptation of demand to supply in a renewable energy-driven future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAssess the cost-benefit of investment in DSM programmes, accounting for the energy and cost\n    savings it can provide instead of investing in grid infrastructure expansion.\nEnsure grid planning prioritises modernisation and DSM technology to close critical technology\n    gaps as infrastructure expands. Developing economies can explore innovative financing models –\n    such as blended finance – to mobilise investment in grid and DSM solutions.\nImprove data availability within the wider electricity system to enable innovation in DSM and\n    access to applications like smart meters by consumers and third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nGovernments have a crucial role to play in tripling renewable power capacity and placing the world on a\n1.5°C pathway. All too often, the energy transition discourse relegates governments’ responsibilities to\ncreating an enabling environment for private investments through predictable and stable policies, and\nthe creation of instruments that de-risk investment projects. Although this is crucial, a much broader and\nmore integrated policy approach is required to facilitate the adoption of an entire spectrum of energy\ntransition solutions needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and unlock its socio-economic benefits (Figure 8).\n\nGovernments need to be far more engaged in shaping and guiding the energy transition, including through\npolicies for ambitious public investment programmes and sufficient forward-planning for renewables\nscale-up, system integration and grid build-out.\n\nCross-cutting approaches covering all renewable technologies, electrification technologies and others\nare needed to facilitate the energy transition (e.g. energy storage), include enabling policies that set\nambitions and send clear signals to stakeholders, eliminate distortions, incentivise the uptake of solutions\nand facilitate access to affordable financing. They also include policies that ensure the integration of\nrenewables within energy systems, economies, nature and societies, as well as specific deployment\npolicies for various technologies. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand.\n\nTransitioning to a renewables-based economy may also bring challenges in the form of financing gaps,\nlabour market disruptions and energy sector insecurity. These misalignments, if not well-managed,\nrisk inequitable outcomes and a slower pace of the energy transition. Therefore, a set of structural and\njust transition policies, along with the creation of strong institutions to ensure policy co-ordination and\ncohesion, is required to manage potential misalignments.\n\nFinally, a holistic global policy framework that entails international collaboration including North-South\nand South-South co-operation is needed to bring stakeholders from countries around the world together\nto commit to a just transition that leaves no one behind and strengthens international finance flows,\ncapacities and technologies in an equitable manner.\n\nThis section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nFIGURE 8 The IRENA holistic policy framework for a just and inclusive energy transition\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2021b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Enhanced energy efficiency is a crucial enabler for making high\nlevels of end-use electrification feasible and affordable. Measures related to reducing energy demand\nand improving efficiency are needed across all end-use sectors.\n\nMinimum energy performance standards (MEPS) can support industrial, commercial and residential\nusers to procure and switch to more energy efficient appliances or equipment such as electric heating/\ncooling technologies. Building codes can set energy performance requirements by specifying insulation\nstandards, thereby reducing heating and cooling demands. They can also specify greenhouse gas\nemission targets and carbon footprints. For renovation, in particular, codes can be coupled with financial\nincentives.\n\nIt is also important to address prevailing challenges associated with building ownership structures,\nequitable access and benefit-sharing of energy efficiency investments and policies. “Green loans” could\ncarry lower interest rates and protect low-income energy consumers from energy price fluctuations\nand inflationary environments. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.\n\nIn the transport sector, significant improvements can be achieved by promoting energy efficient mobility\n(e.g. public transport such as railways, metros and buses, and car-sharing), as well as active (nonmotorised) transport such as cycling and walking in urban areas. Public campaigns can be undertaken by\nnational and local governments to encourage green mobility modes. Other policies, such as differentiated\nparking fees and highway tolls, can encourage a shift to public transport, complemented by dedicated\ndriving lanes for car-sharing. Public transportation fleets also offer the opportunity to utilise costcompetitive renewable fuels or electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement with specific time horizons and outline\n    clear avenues for implementation.\n    \nStrengthen regulatory frameworks, including building codes that specify low energy performance\n    and appliance energy efficiency standards.\n    \nExpand the availability of financial incentives and affordable lending schemes for meeting\n    standards on energy efficiency, such as tax credits or green loans with favourable interest rates\n    for building renovation or modernisation.\n    \nEstablish public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy efficiency measures, public\n    transport and green mobility for cost savings and collective decarbonisation goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket incentives and fiscal policy\nWhile renewables have become increasingly competitive, they still face barriers compared to fossil fuels.\nRising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective. The choice of instrument and its design should consider: the nature of the solution\n(e.g. utility-scale, distributed, off-grid); level of development of the sector; power system organisational\nstructure; wider macroeconomic environment (e.g. impact of inflation and commodity price volatility);\nand broader policy objectives. It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below). This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk. A mechanism to allow for bilateral power\nprocurement between generators and private off-takers (such as industrial actors or corporates) can\nfurther strengthen the case for large deployment volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments.\n    \nIntroduce tax credits, levies and/or exemptions on import/export duties for key materials and\n    components in the renewable energy supply chain.\n    \nEnsure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains.\n    \nConsider the trade-offs between ‘lowest-price’ objectives, and other policy outcomes such as\n    socio-economic development, system integration and industry sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower market design and regulation\nThe world is entering a new era in which electricity systems will be increasingly dominated by zeromarginal-cost renewable technologies. Power markets must evolve and adapt to new market forces,\nsuch as corporate and industrial demand, and behind-the-meter (prosumer) generation. They must be\norganised in a way that incentivises new investment in renewable power generation and the flexibility to\nprovide reliable electricity at a level required for the 1.5°C pathway. This requires governments and other\nstakeholders to undertake a close examination of their power systems’ organisational structures, i.e. the\ninstitutions, processes and arrangements through which electricity services are exchanged and rewarded.\n\nWholesale power markets today are based on marginal cost pricing, where the most expensive\ngenerator (with the highest variable cost – typically fossil fuel-fired plants) determines electricity\nprices for the time period in which the market operates. This poses a number of challenges. As the\nshare of renewable power grows, wholesale spot markets will see increased price volatility, as periods\nof high renewable power generation push clearing prices in the wholesale market close to zero. When\nrenewable generation is less than demand, flexibility resources will be needed, potentially resulting in\nvery high prices at certain times.\n\nIf wholesale markets are the main source of revenue, the economic feasibility of new investments will\nplummet, as even existing generators will struggle to recover their initial capital costs whilst prospective\ninvestors realise diminishing returns. The paradigm that relies on free markets to incentivise power\nsupply investment decisions therefore needs to change.\n\nUltimately, a renewables-based power system requires enhanced flexibility; wholesale market design\nmust deliver this as well as providing the volume of renewable power needed. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.\n\nPower system organisational structures must evolve to better align with energy policy and\ndecarbonisation goals. A “dual procurement” power market design could introduce long-term\ncontract mechanisms (e.g. Auctions, CfDs, PPAs) as the backbone of renewable power procurement,\nalongside a short-term market to dispatch flexible resources in an affordable way (IRENA, 2022a).\nThis holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system.\n\nThis transformation is partially underway, as auctions are becoming the preferred tool to procure\nrenewable energy, and wholesale markets are becoming more time and location granular (IRENA,\n2023a); but there are meaningful actions authorities can take now to ensure the acceleration of this trend.\n\nOne way to achieve enhanced system flexibility is for power markets to allow flexibility technologies\n(such as batteries and pumped hydropower) to provide ancillary services and be rewarded accordingly.\nAncillary services that serve to stabilise the grid network and will become increasingly important as\ndispatchable fossil fuel-based generation is phased out of the power mix. Today, many power systems\nreward the provision of energy but not ancillary services (where these services are not included in\ncontractual obligations). They therefore need to be appropriately valued and reflected in power system\ndesign. Valuing, pricing and procuring ancillary services astutely can bring new players to the grid, with\nadvantages for the whole power system. Examples of this include the enhanced frequency regulation\nauctions in the UK.\n\nTo achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This includes growth in distributed renewable energy\ngeneration systems – notably using solar PV – but also community solar and wind projects. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. Such measures can maximise the socio-economic benefits of renewable energy, insulate consumers from price volatility, create local supply\nchains and job opportunities, and enhance public perceptions of renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors.\nDesign auctions that balance competitive price discovery and long-term delivery of affordable\n    electricity. Auctions should also be run for sufficiently large and ambitious volumes, with\n    consistent, transparent tendering schedules to effectively foster competitive bidding.\nCreate a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix.\nRethink participation rules to allow new technologies to engage in the power market as flexibility\n    providers, including storage and demand side aggregators.\nEncourage investment in distributed renewable energy systems that allow consumers to become\n    “prosumers” by both using and producing clean electricity.\nReorganise power market structures to ensure policies for accelerating renewables deployment\n    account for system flexibility as well as sustainable returns to generators and investors.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamlining permitting\nThe time and cost constraints imposed by permitting procedures represent a major bottleneck\nimpacting the deployment of renewable energy projects in many countries. It is essential that permitting\nprocedures are fit-for-purpose and keep pace with renewable and climate targets, without compromising\nenvironmental and social impact standards. Experiences from the public and private sectors indicate\nthat best practices in permitting centre on four areas: administrative consolidation; digitalisation; policy\nsupport; and public engagement (European Commission, 2023).\n\nRenewable energy developers often need to consult numerous authorities at national, sub-national and\nsometimes village or prefecture level for the necessary permits to build a project. This process can be\nlengthy and extremely bureaucratic; for instance, the global average time required for permitting an\noffshore wind project is nine years. Onshore wind and utility-scale PV permitting processes can also\nbe long, although they are typically shorter than those for offshore wind. Similar obstacles exist for\nhydropower projects and smaller scale distributed projects for end consumers using renewable energy\ntechnologies like rooftop solar.\n\nCreating dedicated, centralised authorities is one way to streamline this process by ensuring developers\ncan refer to a single focal point. Countries like Denmark and the Philippines have already adopted a “one-stop shop” model to accelerate renewables deployment, but this model only works if it is adequately\nresourced. In addition, digitalised processes to submit and track applications would enable developments\nto progress more efficiently, while access to digitised local consenting and historical dispute records\nwould allow developers and authorities to screen sites that could be high-risk or unsuitable at an early\nstage (IRENA, 2023h).\n\nAn overarching best practice is the introduction of legislation mandating a maximum lead time for the\npermitting of renewable energy projects. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. Gaining social acceptance through\npublic engagement with relevant stakeholders is critical in the consenting and constructing stages of a\nrenewable energy project. This includes early and continuous consultation by authorities and developers\nwith local communities to communicate the benefits and considerations brought by a project to the area,\nas well as a transparent conflict resolution mechanism that sincerely addresses community concerns.\n\nComprehensive and efficient permitting frameworks represent a clear win-win, allowing renewable\nenergy development to expand this decade while cultivating acceptance with other interests in land and\nsea spaces. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023).\n\nRecent studies indicate that adopting best practices in permitting could cut consenting time for utility-scale wind and solar projects by more than half; for example, onshore wind farms could be permitted in\none year, offshore wind farms in 1.5 years and solar farms in as little as three months (ETC, 2023). This\nmakes permitting a high-impact enabler for the energy transition, where the necessary investment in\nresource, policy support and capacity will bring enormous value to countries in accelerating renewables\ngrowth and securing associated socio-economic and environmental benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023).\n\nThe energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. If not well managed, these\nmisalignments risk inequitable outcomes, which could sow doubt among policy makers and the\npublic concerning the advantages of the transition and lead to a fractured and unco-ordinated policy\nenvironment. Hence, there is a need for policies and measures that equitably distribute the benefits of\nthe energy transition and raise public awareness about these positive impacts.\n\nIn terms of jobs, sectoral misalignments may arise due to potential shifts in value and supply chains\nduring the energy transition. For instance, transitioning from fossil fuel power generation to solar energy\nmay shift the focus from fuel extraction to the semi-conductor industry. The impact on employment\ndepends on factors such as domestic production and labour productivity. Labour-market interventions\nencompass adequate employment services attuned to evolving circumstances and needs, along with\nmeasures to facilitate labour mobility (IRENA and ILO, 2023).\n\nCommunity benefit schemes span countries from Costa Rica to Mali and adopt a range of structures,\nfrom shared ownership of renewable assets to industry sponsorship of critical social and economic\ninfrastructure in host communities (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2020). Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions.\n\nAligning policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition will facilitate local\nvalue creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, and on a larger scale, ensure political\nand social stability as renewable energy expands.\n\nAs part of a sensitive and efficient permitting framework, renewable development must be well integrated\nwith the principles of sustainability, circular economy and reduced environmental impact – particularly\non land use and biodiversity. This also applies to enabling infrastructure, with grid expansion into remote\nand biodiverse areas requiring careful siting.\n\nAdopting sustainable end-of-life management policies, including waste management legislation, can\nhelp countries prepare for the anticipated volumes of equipment waste such as solar PV panels and\nbatteries. Research and development programmes across the energy and waste sectors, and industrial\nclusters, can help to further scale waste management infrastructure on a national or regional basis\n(IRENA and IEA, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition and foster local\n    value creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, with a special focus on the\n    inclusion of marginalised groups.\nAnticipate labour market disruptions and establish programmes that can address workforce\n    gaps, minimise labour misalignments, create opportunities for targeted recruitment and labour\n    mobility, such as relocation grants, and establish social protection programmes.\nMinimise adverse environmental impacts and encourage nature-positive approaches, for example\n    by incentivising the uptake of sustainability standards for new renewable energy assets – such as\n    the Hydropower Sustainability Standard – as part of procurement schemes.\nEnsure the impacts of mining activities and the use of relatively scarce components are mitigated\n    through provisions for circular economy (end-of-life management, recycling and reuse of materials).\nGather information on renewables’ waste production through regular monitoring of waste\n    produced by technology, the composition of waste streams, installed system performance and the\n    causes and frequency of system failures, in order to adopt waste minimisation legislation suitable\n    for the pace and scale of the transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\r\n \n\n\n\n\nBuilding resilient supply chains\nThe vulnerabilities of key energy industries to logistics bottlenecks, commodity price volatility, trade\nbarriers, and commodity and component import dependencies have become increasingly apparent in\nrecent years. Energy supply chains have become a priority agenda for policy makers, as demand and\ncompetition for critical raw materials, rare earth elements and production capacity become more acute.\n\nWithout well-functioning and cost-efficient industrial supply chains, the energy transition will not\nmaterialise. If not well managed, competition, security and scarcity challenges in renewable energy\nsupply chains could lead to a disorderly transition, characterised by slower rates of renewables\ndeployment at inflated costs. A mismatch between supply and demand for several critical minerals is\nalready evident, with particularly high levels observed for lithium – a key material required for the shortduration energy storage and electric transport sectors (IRENA, 2023e). Bottlenecks for key components\nin the wind industry – e.g. nacelles, blades and gearboxes – are set to emerge by the second half of this\ndecade in Asia and the Americas (GWEC, 2023). High concentration risk in the global renewables supply\nchain also raises the prospect of price or security of supply uncertainty in the future.\n\nRobust and resilient global supply chains are required to support a 1.5°C pathway. The mining and\nprocessing of critical materials including lithium, copper, nickel and other rare earth metals are\nconstrained within specific geographies, exposing these supply chains to geopolitical tensions and\nconcentration risks (IRENA, 2023e). Policy makers should work with the private sector to identify\nproduction gaps and supply chain weaknesses on a national and regional basis, and generate strategies\nto reinforce supply chain security.\n\nSocially responsible procurement is another key issue, where many critical materials and components\nrefined or manufactured in one country are imported by others for use in the renewables sector. It will\nbe vital to ensure supply chains – in the mining and processing segments in particular – are managed\nwith respect to fair trade, and high environmental, social governance (ESG) and sustainability standards.\nResilient supply chains are also key to sustaining the cost-value proposition of renewable energy around\nthe world.\n\nAs countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. The need for local value creation and regional supply chain\ninvestment must be carefully balanced with reducing trade barriers for goods and services central to\nthe renewables renewables industry. This will be key to avoid intensifying supply chain bottlenecks\nand making renewables less cost-competitive, while maximising socio-economic benefits.\n\nMultilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. This will require governments to work with industry, civil society and other stakeholders to\nensure supply chain planning is conducted through a wider lens that encompasses national interests,\ncost-effective and socially responsible sourcing, long-term social and environmental sustainability, and\nclimate and renewable energy targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate with the renewables industry on industrial development reviews and plans for the\n    transition that are sustainable, achievable, and adequately mitigate risk of supply insecurity\n    and price volatility. Approaches include diversifying sources of production, anticipating critical\n    production gaps and localising value chains.\nEnsure socially responsible procurement of renewables by encouraging uptake of sustainable\n    supply chain assurance schemes, such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative.\nIncentivise public–private partnerships and investment in circularity to encourage reuse of\n    materials and a circular economy approach to project development, which can help to reduce\n    concentration risk and supply insecurity of critical materials.\nCo-operate with international fora and financial institutions to safeguard international trade\n    corridors for materials and components for key renewable energy technologies.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation, training and capacity-building\nBuilding a skilled energy transition workforce requires measures to both expand the talent pipeline and\nenhance the quality of education and training provisions.\n\nEarly exposure to renewable energy topics and careers is vital for sparking interest in pursuing a career in the\nsector, but also to increase social acceptance by a knowledgeable citizenry. The curricula at higher education\nand vocational training institutions must reflect the skills and competences required by the transition.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the content of education and training programmes, it is also important to\nenhance the instructional methods used. For example, experiential learning methods where students are\nencouraged to develop problem-solving strategies can help to prepare learners for jobs in the constantly\nevolving renewable energy sector, where independent knowledge-seeking will often be necessary.\n\nFacilitating collaboration between government agencies on workforce development, industry and\neducational institutions will contribute to more co-ordinated skill-matching efforts. It is vital to consider\nhow a just transition can respond to potential labour displacement in the existing energy sector workforce\nand re-skill or upskill appropriately.\n\nTargeted measures to train, recruit and retain women and other underrepresented or marginalised groups\n(including older workers, ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities and those on a low\nincome) will ensure the dividends of the transition are enjoyed by all. This inclusion can be implemented\nthrough early exposure to renewable energy leadership and career pathways, targeted scholarships,\ngovernment-funded training opportunities, and industry apprenticeship and mentorship schemes.\n\nOutside the renewables industry, it is equally important to ensure sufficiently skilled and trained workers\nare available in government departments concerned with international trade, supply chains, electric\ncharging infrastructure and land use. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government.\n\nCarefully designed public-private partnerships (PPPs) can also play a crucial role in improving overall\ntraining quality while meeting sectoral labour requirements, promoting national skill standards and\nmatchmaking communities with workplace training opportunities. In addition to improving training\ncontent, PPPs can also play a role in shifting the financing of training provisions to a more integrated\napproach that incorporates multiple funding mechanisms including payroll-based training levies, tax\nincentives, scholarships and donations, vouchers and student loans (Dunbar, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign workforce planning among all stakeholders, including labour agencies, labour unions, the\n    wider energy industry and educational institutions, to identify critical skill gaps and workforce\n    needs in advance, and to design skill-building strategies accordingly.\nProvide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition.\nEnsure energy transition goals are reflected in educational programmes and resources, such\n    as university curricula, vocational training institutions, occupational health and safety training\n    institutions, and professional education programmes.\nBuild the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce.\nInvest in reskilling and upskilling measures for vulnerable communities and those in fossil fuel\n    industries to ensure the employment benefits of the transition are extended to a wide subset of\n    the population. Such measures need to be embedded in broader regional economic revitalisation\n    programmes and investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nSCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). However, investments remain focused on a few technologies and concentrated\nin a limited number of countries. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). This trend is reflected in renewable power\ncapacity additions, as all of Africa accounted for less than 2% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA,\n2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023).\n\nTo achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. It is equally important that investments to modernise power grids and enhance operational flexibility\nincrease from the annual average investment of USD 274 billion in 2022 to USD 605 billion by 2030. 10 \n\nThis presents a dual challenge: 1) how to scale existing investment flows in countries and technologies;\nand 2) how to ensure these investment flows reach countries that are currently underserved by the\nenergy transition. Efforts to address the much higher cost of capital faced by developing economies –\nas much as three to five times more than in most OECD countries – are also needed (IRENA, 2023f). A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects.\n\nRepurposing public capital from the fossil fuel sector, including both direct investments and financial\nsupport in the form of subsidies, can help accelerate progress towards unlocking the capital required.\nThis public money can then catalyse private capital flows, amplifying investment efforts towards the\nUSD 35 trillion required (for the energy transition as a whole) in the remainder of this decade.\n\nFor example, public financial flows to fossil fuels in the G20 countries alone reached USD 1.4 trillion in\n2022 – more than double 2019 levels. Moreover, G20 governments supported the global fossil fuel industry\nthrough international aid, export credit support and concessional financing (such as equity, grants, loans\nand loan guarantees) at an average of USD 50 billion per year from 2019 to 2021 (IISD, 2023).\n\nPublic funding is urgently needed for basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to\ndrive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as industry and transport,\nor synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investment is scarce. Without this, the gap in\ninvestment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen, to the detriment of\nbillions of people and the success of a just and inclusive global energy transition.\n\nA more comprehensive definition of risk around investing in energy assets is needed. A narrow focus on\nthe return risk to investors must expand to encompass environmental and social risks. This approach,\nwhich should be exercised through rigorous international benchmarks and protocols for investment,\ncan also help to shift funding from fossil fuel assets to the renewables sector. With limited public funds\navailable in the developing world, the international community must step up.\n\nPublic funds (domestic or through international collaboration) must flow through intermediaries\n(e.g. governments, development finance institutions and global funds such as the Green Climate Fund).\nSuch instruments should channel public funds towards policies that support structural change and a\njust transition. Furthermore, these instruments should be designed progressively to ensure economic\nbenefits are shared in an equitable way.\n\nFinally, public investments are needed for economic interventions to support a more equitable\ndistribution of benefits from large-scale renewables growth. National carbon pricing revenues,\nfor example, could be redirected to support clean, affordable electricity access for lower-income\nhouseholds on a progressive basis.\n\nIt is also important to actively engage the private sector, given that public financing alone will not be\nanywhere near sufficient to address the huge investment needs for the global energy transition. The public\nsector can play a catalysing role by providing a conducive and predictable enabling environment for the\nlong-term investment decisions made in the private sector. Also, governments can set the right conditions\nfor private sector actors to build and finance a viable pipeline of energy transition-oriented projects.\n\nFor example, blended finance structures would allow concessional public finance, and even philanthropic\ngrant-based finance, to improve the risk-return profile of an investment, so that private capital is\nattracted at lower cost and/or better terms (IRENA, 2023g). Banks can also pool loans to relatively\nsmall renewables projects into a securitised product aimed at impact-minded investors, including retail\ninvestors who otherwise have few avenues to earn returns while funding renewables deployment (GFMA\nand BCG, 2020). The resulting financial portfolio of projects would reduce the perceived risk associated\nwith its individual components. Such an approach would require a level of contract standardisation to\nenable the bundling of small projects (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nWhile there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. In addition to the measures described above, capital mobilisation schemes like green\nbonds for renewables, as well as international coalition-building to guide distribution of renewables\ninvestment between the Global North and Global South, will be crucial to ensure renewables can\nequitably scale this decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation).\n    \nPromote the adoption of a comprehensive definition of investment risk within public and private\n    institutions that encompasses environmental and social externalities, thereby aligning financial\n    decision-making with broader public and social goals.\n    \nCollaborate with public and private sector actors to develop innovative, context-specific financing\n    and business models that address renewable energy financing gaps in underinvested countries.\n    This involves utilising blended finance, green bonds, financial aggregation, and innovative risk\n    mitigation tools tailored to each country’s unique needs.\n    \nDirect the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access.\n    \nFor Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. A fractured and unaligned approach to renewables deployment will lead\nto missed opportunities for countries to accelerate growth and enjoy the benefits of clean electricity,\nparticularly in the Global South. Public and private stakeholders alike are responsible for enhancing\nparticipation in multilateral initiatives that can facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building to\ndeliver a just transition via a 1.5°C pathway.\n\nWith the lion’s share of renewables investment benefiting developed economies, it will be important to\nstrengthen North-South and South-South collaboration to maximise the social and economic benefits\nfrom clean industrialisation. Country blocs such as the G20 can be powerful coalitions to mobilise support\nand investment around the global renewable energy target and its key enablers.\n\nMobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables.\n\nAdvanced economies are better positioned to mobilise public financing, but global policy frameworks are\nnecessary to secure affordable funding to underpin the energy transition at the national level elsewhere. In\nemerging economies, just transition funds need to be established to support plant closures, communities\nin transition, repurposing/rehabilitation, and retraining and skilling, among other priorities. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. A high proportion of the public funding mobilised will need to\nbe grant-based, avoiding the danger of adding to already high debt burdens faced by many countries.\n\nInternational climate finance has a key role to play in providing the public financing necessary for a just and\nfair energy transition. Its function will vary depending on the context; fossil fuel-dependent communities\nand countries will require targeted efforts to unwind lock-ins to the fossil fuel economy and plan an\nalternative development trajectory based on renewable power generation and economic activities (CPR,\n2021). Countries where mitigation requirements consistent with climate targets go beyond their fair\nshare of the global mitigation burden will require support to trigger the needed collaborative framework,\nleapfrog to renewables-based energy systems and reap their share of the transition benefits.\n\nIt will be important to ensure definitions, standards, governance and investment protocols for the\nenergy transition are fairly aligned to effectively funnel capital to renewables development that meets\nhigh social and environmental standards. From green taxonomy to emissions reduction standards, the\nneed for common ground in the renewables and green hydrogen sectors will be increasingly helpful for\nmultinational investors, companies and civil society actors to navigate the transition.\n\nInternational collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. There are many areas for continued innovation and learning, from DSM\nto LDES to green hydrogen derivatives – all of which will have a positive impact on decarbonisation.\nPlatforms for knowledge-sharing and imparting lessons learnt, such as the IRENA Collaborative Frameworks or the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), are important vehicles to ensure ambition\ncan be transformed into effective action at country level. This is particularly important for those countries\nthat are most vulnerable to the severe impacts of climate change, and so face more significant challenges\nto protect communities without adequate support for adaptation measures (UNCTAD, 2022).\n\nFinally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy.\nThe ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). Scaling up grid planning will support a more economic and\nsustainable approach to the transition, enabling better system balancing and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity.

Multiple measures are required,\nincluding:\n\n\nInnovative power planning, grid expansion, modernisation and\n    enhancement, and addressing interconnection backlogs (projects\n    awaiting connection to the grid).\n    \nChanges in grid operation and management, potentially also\n    including new market design.\n    \nIncreased interconnectors between countries and regions.\n    \nGrowth in electricity storage; comprising short-duration storage\n    for increasing grid flexibility and long-duration storage to enhance\n    energy security (e.g. pumped storage).\n    \nMeasures to allow greater integration of demand-side management\n    and behind-the-meter (consumer) flexibility options (e.g. distributed\n    storage).\n    \nIntroducing other flexibility sources (e.g. green hydrogen, hybrid\n    renewable parks combining wind/solar/storage, etc.).\n    \n\n\nFIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). 4  With clarity on grid infrastructure development\nplans and reasonable guarantees on connection availability, investors will feel more confident building\nnew generation; meanwhile, consumers would be more likely to invest in electrification when a reliable\nsupply of low-cost electricity can be made available.\n\nWhen integrating higher shares of locally available variable solar and wind power, power systems will\nalso need to innovate to become: increasingly decentralised, allowing electricity to be generated at\nlocations closer to demand; and bi-directional, allowing electricity from distributed power generating\nfacilities to be injected into the grid.\n\nModernised, smarter grids are required; in the European Union (EU), around 30% of the envisaged\ninvestment in grids by 2030 could be earmarked for digitalisation 5  (European Commission, 2022).\nThey will also need to be larger and more robust. Hence, grid costs are expected to increase over time\n(IRENA, 2023a). This will require fast-tracked permitting to ensure timely investments in modern grids.\nAdding more widely distributed power generation sources will also bring resilience, especially against\nincreasingly intense extreme weather events owing to climate change (IPCC, 2023).\n\nThe electrification of transport also requires significant investments in enabling infrastructure. Electric\nvehicles will potentially account for more than 80% of all road transport activity by 2050; with 359 million\nelectric and plug-in hybrid light passenger vehicles worldwide by 2030 and 2 182 million by 2050 (IRENA,\n2023a); yet their market entry will be contingent upon coordinated investments in charging infrastructure\nand power grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure planning, timelines and assessments of investment needs for grids are aligned with long-term targets for renewable energy buildout and end-use sector decarbonisation, e.g. transport.\nMobilise funds for long-term grid investment; channel donor finance to building capacity and\n    infrastructure for integrating renewables; and streamline permitting procedures for new grid\n    infrastructure and upgrades to existing transmission and distribution infrastructure.\nDevelop modernised, decentralised (where suitable) and more resilient grid systems using\n    digitalisation, smart applications for demand-side management and interconnections with\n    neighbouring grid systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur.\nHistorically, this has been provided by pumped storage and hydropower with reservoirs.\nHowever, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). All of these technologies are undergoing rapid\ninnovation.\n\nFIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. saving energy from spring days with low loads and abundant solar to deploy\nduring high load days in the summer; or from windy autumn days to deploy during high load cloudy winter\ndays). Diverse storage technologies enhance the resilience of grids that are subject to extreme weather\nfor prolonged periods, help relieve grid congestion, provide transmission services and shore up local\narea reliability.\n\nLDES, including storage technologies spanning 10+, 24+, 100+ and 150+ hours in duration and providing\nboth power and heat, is also able to provide other grid services including black start (restarting parts\nof the grid where power has been lost in a blackout) and micro-grid level assistance for areas or key\ninfrastructure that may lose power. Storage durations can span weeks or months in the case of pumped\nstorage and reservoir hydropower. As the largest form of installed flexibility at over 175 GW worldwide,\npumped storage hydropower can play an important role in providing LDES and vital grid services, with\nsubstantial potential for off-river pumped storage to be developed in the coming decades (IHA, 2023).\nSome LDES technologies are commercially available today, while others are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Numerous companies are signing contracts (e.g. with utilities, airports, data centres,\nindustrial users, etc.) and are deploying LDES at grid-scale quantities, and pumped storage has been\nsuccessfully deployed for decades.\n\nOne emerging LDES technology is hydrogen storage. Hydrogen’s true competitive strength lies in its\nunique ability to store energy for long periods of time in large quantities. As green hydrogen displaces\nfossil fuels in some end uses, hydrogen storage could become increasingly critical to energy security,\nin the same way that natural gas storage is today in many regions. Hydrogen storage will be needed\nprimarily to meet variation in supply (rather than demand), as green hydrogen is created using VRE\nsources. Long-term hydrogen storage can play an important role in strengthening energy security and\nsystem resilience (IRENA, 2023d). Support for the continued development of these technologies is\ncritical for decarbonisation.\n\nIn many places, however, legacy market arrangements and policy frameworks do not incentivise\ninvestment in storage at scale. Action from policy makers can drive progress in this sector, such as:\nassessing energy storage and flexibility needs; setting LDES mandates for medium- and long-term\ncapacity targets; updating criteria for marketplaces; providing innovation grants and subsidies for prefeasibility studies; and establishing public-private partnerships.\n\nOther market innovations can also foster a healthy storage market, such as the introduction of congestion\nmanagement trading platforms, ancillary services markets to support the grid, and awarding additional\nvalue for features such as flexibility in capacity payments and capability to provide peaking power\n(e.g. storage technologies that can replace a natural gas peaking plant should be reflected in system\nmodelling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConduct technical assessments of system decarbonisation needs and timelines, and ensure the\n    planned buildout of renewables is complemented by storage resources of varying duration, as\n    well as other sources of flexibility.\nCollaborate with regulators and the renewables sector to enhance power market planning and\n    ensure price signals, clear targets and procurement incentivise longer duration storage.\nEncourage investment and innovation in diverse storage technologies to suit different users, such\n    as by establishing research, development and innovation (RDI) grant programmes, encouraging\n    public–private partnerships and setting medium- and long-term capacity targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-use electrification and sector coupling\nWith solar and wind power scaling up rapidly in this decade, electrification has become a vital\ndecarbonisation pathway. Green hydrogen and its derivatives, produced by electrolysers using low-cost\nrenewable power, can be used to decarbonise end-use sectors that are difficult to electrify directly –\nsuch as iron and steel making, and shipping – and to provide seasonal energy storage solutions.\n\nHowever, electrification needs to be accelerated by systemic innovation, making it not only faster but\nsmarter. Smart electrification – through sector coupling and enhanced flexibility – prevents a higher peak\nelectricity load on the power system. It also enables the power system to accommodate new loads while\nallowing integration of a higher share of variable renewable electricity in a cost-efficient manner. This\ncan help sustain renewables-based electrification without jeopardising energy system operation, thus\nmaking the power system robust and resilient. To harness all these benefits, systemic innovation should\ninvolve the entire energy value chain across four key dimensions: technology and infrastructure; market\ndesign and regulation; system planning and operation; and business models (IRENA, 2023d). Smart\ncharging for electric vehicles is a good example in this regard.\n\nSector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nThe benefit of this will be smarter, more intelligent demand-side management, achieved by deploying\nmore advanced digital technologies both behind-the-meter (by energy consumers) and in power\nsystems. Demand response would become more agile and inter-operational through sector-coupled\ntechnologies such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to smart charging\nfacilities. This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nEnd-use electrification, sector-coupling and the rapid scale-up of variable renewable electricity all\nrequire integrated cross-sectoral infrastructure planning – a process for optimising the co-development\nof increasingly connected infrastructure in various sectors. 7 The European Hotmaps project offers an\nopen-source toolbox to support public authorities, energy agencies and urban planners as they plan\nheating and cooling at local, regional and national levels. It allows users to map cooling and heating\ndemand, as well as supply, in the 27 EU Member States and the United Kingdom, and provides renewable\nenergy generation and industrial waste heat potentials (Hotmaps, 2021). This facilitates the integration\nof heating and cooling with waste-to-energy and renewable energy, including power-to-heat. However,\nthis planning approach requires incentives for infrastructure investments where market barriers exist,\ngiven that different infrastructures operate under different legislative, regulatory and policy regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt a sector-coupling approach to the decarbonisation of economies by pursuing smart\n    electrification of the transport, buildings and industry sectors.\nCreate fora for co-ordinated planning among relevant authorities on infrastructure development,\n    including renewable energy projects, grid and transmission assets, electric vehicle charging\n    infrastructure and heat networks.\nIntroduce economic incentives for smart electrification and demand-side response (such as tax\n    credits and innovation grants) to encourage private investment in sector-coupling solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand-side management\nElectricity systems are complex; in addition to the grid infrastructure planning required to unlock the\nbenefits of sector coupling, distributed grid planning and operations will need well-defined energy\nmanagement schemes on both sides of the end-user meter. These schemes apply to both the supply side\n(power management) and demand side (load management).\nDemand-side management (DSM) comprises a set of strategies traditionally aimed at reducing peak\ndemand, which will be increasingly needed to incentivise consumption in periods of high VRE generation.\nDSM addresses various challenges, including VRE integration, rising electricity costs and environmental\nimpacts. For example, DSM can employ time-of-use pricing to encourage customers to shift electricity\nusage to off-peak hours, while demand response programmes can financially reward customers for\nreducing electricity usage during peak hours or consuming electricity during high VRE generation\nperiods. Critical-peak pricing, real-time pricing and critical-peak rebates are also among the strategies\navailable. These approaches are crucial for optimising energy efficiency in both residential and industrial\nbuildings.\nAs the transition advances, DSM will also provide flexibility to alleviate the need for more costly\nrequirements. Several challenges persist, however – particularly in Latin America, the Middle East and\nNorth Africa, and other Global South regions. Notable issues include physical grid and digital technology\ninfrastructure gaps, as well as complex and inconsistent regulations and policies. Financing challenges\nalso hinder progress; attracting investment in clean energy enablers like DSM solutions requires\ninnovative financing models and incentives.\nIntelligent load control, demand response and energy efficiency are pivotal in enabling a secure and\nresilient renewables-based power system. Continued investment and innovation in these areas will\nfurther drive the adaptation of demand to supply in a renewable energy-driven future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAssess the cost-benefit of investment in DSM programmes, accounting for the energy and cost\n    savings it can provide instead of investing in grid infrastructure expansion.\nEnsure grid planning prioritises modernisation and DSM technology to close critical technology\n    gaps as infrastructure expands. Developing economies can explore innovative financing models –\n    such as blended finance – to mobilise investment in grid and DSM solutions.\nImprove data availability within the wider electricity system to enable innovation in DSM and\n    access to applications like smart meters by consumers and third parties.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants.\nThis will require enhancements to – and expansion of – current power\ngrid systems, and the modernisation and upgrading of power system\noperations.\n\nWith VRE sources becoming the major source of power in a\n1.5°C-compatible world, countries must start upgrading and\nexpanding their power grid infrastructure to prepare for increasing\nend-use sector electrification.

As green hydrogen displaces\nfossil fuels in some end uses, hydrogen storage could become increasingly critical to energy security,\nin the same way that natural gas storage is today in many regions. Hydrogen storage will be needed\nprimarily to meet variation in supply (rather than demand), as green hydrogen is created using VRE\nsources. Long-term hydrogen storage can play an important role in strengthening energy security and\nsystem resilience (IRENA, 2023d). Support for the continued development of these technologies is\ncritical for decarbonisation.\n\nIn many places, however, legacy market arrangements and policy frameworks do not incentivise\ninvestment in storage at scale. Action from policy makers can drive progress in this sector, such as:\nassessing energy storage and flexibility needs; setting LDES mandates for medium- and long-term\ncapacity targets; updating criteria for marketplaces; providing innovation grants and subsidies for prefeasibility studies; and establishing public-private partnerships.\n\nOther market innovations can also foster a healthy storage market, such as the introduction of congestion\nmanagement trading platforms, ancillary services markets to support the grid, and awarding additional\nvalue for features such as flexibility in capacity payments and capability to provide peaking power\n(e.g. storage technologies that can replace a natural gas peaking plant should be reflected in system\nmodelling).\n\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur.\nHistorically, this has been provided by pumped storage and hydropower with reservoirs.\nHowever, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). All of these technologies are undergoing rapid\ninnovation.\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. saving energy from spring days with low loads and abundant solar to deploy\nduring high load days in the summer; or from windy autumn days to deploy during high load cloudy winter\ndays). Diverse storage technologies enhance the resilience of grids that are subject to extreme weather\nfor prolonged periods, help relieve grid congestion, provide transmission services and shore up local\narea reliability.\n\nLDES, including storage technologies spanning 10+, 24+, 100+ and 150+ hours in duration and providing\nboth power and heat, is also able to provide other grid services including black start (restarting parts\nof the grid where power has been lost in a blackout) and micro-grid level assistance for areas or key\ninfrastructure that may lose power. Storage durations can span weeks or months in the case of pumped\nstorage and reservoir hydropower. As the largest form of installed flexibility at over 175 GW worldwide,\npumped storage hydropower can play an important role in providing LDES and vital grid services, with\nsubstantial potential for off-river pumped storage to be developed in the coming decades (IHA, 2023).\nSome LDES technologies are commercially available today, while others are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Numerous companies are signing contracts (e.g. with utilities, airports, data centres,\nindustrial users, etc.) and are deploying LDES at grid-scale quantities, and pumped storage has been\nsuccessfully deployed for decades.\n\nOne emerging LDES technology is hydrogen storage.

Green hydrogen and its derivatives, produced by electrolysers using low-cost\nrenewable power, can be used to decarbonise end-use sectors that are difficult to electrify directly –\nsuch as iron and steel making, and shipping – and to provide seasonal energy storage solutions.\n\nHowever, electrification needs to be accelerated by systemic innovation, making it not only faster but\nsmarter. Smart electrification – through sector coupling and enhanced flexibility – prevents a higher peak\nelectricity load on the power system. It also enables the power system to accommodate new loads while\nallowing integration of a higher share of variable renewable electricity in a cost-efficient manner. This\ncan help sustain renewables-based electrification without jeopardising energy system operation, thus\nmaking the power system robust and resilient. To harness all these benefits, systemic innovation should\ninvolve the entire energy value chain across four key dimensions: technology and infrastructure; market\ndesign and regulation; system planning and operation; and business models (IRENA, 2023d). Smart\ncharging for electric vehicles is a good example in this regard.\n\nSector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nThe benefit of this will be smarter, more intelligent demand-side management, achieved by deploying\nmore advanced digital technologies both behind-the-meter (by energy consumers) and in power\nsystems. Demand response would become more agile and inter-operational through sector-coupled\ntechnologies such as energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to smart charging\nfacilities. This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).\n\nEnd-use electrification, sector-coupling and the rapid scale-up of variable renewable electricity all\nrequire integrated cross-sectoral infrastructure planning – a process for optimising the co-development\nof increasingly connected infrastructure in various sectors. 7 The European Hotmaps project offers an\nopen-source toolbox to support public authorities, energy agencies and urban planners as they plan\nheating and cooling at local, regional and national levels.

All too often, the energy transition discourse relegates governments’ responsibilities to\ncreating an enabling environment for private investments through predictable and stable policies, and\nthe creation of instruments that de-risk investment projects. Although this is crucial, a much broader and\nmore integrated policy approach is required to facilitate the adoption of an entire spectrum of energy\ntransition solutions needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and unlock its socio-economic benefits (Figure 8).\n\nGovernments need to be far more engaged in shaping and guiding the energy transition, including through\npolicies for ambitious public investment programmes and sufficient forward-planning for renewables\nscale-up, system integration and grid build-out.\n\nCross-cutting approaches covering all renewable technologies, electrification technologies and others\nare needed to facilitate the energy transition (e.g. energy storage), include enabling policies that set\nambitions and send clear signals to stakeholders, eliminate distortions, incentivise the uptake of solutions\nand facilitate access to affordable financing. They also include policies that ensure the integration of\nrenewables within energy systems, economies, nature and societies, as well as specific deployment\npolicies for various technologies. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand.\n\nTransitioning to a renewables-based economy may also bring challenges in the form of financing gaps,\nlabour market disruptions and energy sector insecurity. These misalignments, if not well-managed,\nrisk inequitable outcomes and a slower pace of the energy transition. Therefore, a set of structural and\njust transition policies, along with the creation of strong institutions to ensure policy co-ordination and\ncohesion, is required to manage potential misalignments.\n\nFinally, a holistic global policy framework that entails international collaboration including North-South\nand South-South co-operation is needed to bring stakeholders from countries around the world together\nto commit to a just transition that leaves no one behind and strengthens international finance flows,\ncapacities and technologies in an equitable manner.\n\nThis section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nFIGURE 8 The IRENA holistic policy framework for a just and inclusive energy transition\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2021b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Enhanced energy efficiency is a crucial enabler for making high\nlevels of end-use electrification feasible and affordable. Measures related to reducing energy demand\nand improving efficiency are needed across all end-use sectors.\n\nMinimum energy performance standards (MEPS) can support industrial, commercial and residential\nusers to procure and switch to more energy efficient appliances or equipment such as electric heating/\ncooling technologies. Building codes can set energy performance requirements by specifying insulation\nstandards, thereby reducing heating and cooling demands. They can also specify greenhouse gas\nemission targets and carbon footprints. For renovation, in particular, codes can be coupled with financial\nincentives.\n\nIt is also important to address prevailing challenges associated with building ownership structures,\nequitable access and benefit-sharing of energy efficiency investments and policies. “Green loans” could\ncarry lower interest rates and protect low-income energy consumers from energy price fluctuations\nand inflationary environments. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.\n\nIn the transport sector, significant improvements can be achieved by promoting energy efficient mobility\n(e.g. public transport such as railways, metros and buses, and car-sharing), as well as active (nonmotorised) transport such as cycling and walking in urban areas. Public campaigns can be undertaken by\nnational and local governments to encourage green mobility modes. Other policies, such as differentiated\nparking fees and highway tolls, can encourage a shift to public transport, complemented by dedicated\ndriving lanes for car-sharing. Public transportation fleets also offer the opportunity to utilise costcompetitive renewable fuels or electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAdopt ambitious targets for energy efficiency improvement with specific time horizons and outline\n    clear avenues for implementation.\n    \nStrengthen regulatory frameworks, including building codes that specify low energy performance\n    and appliance energy efficiency standards.\n    \nExpand the availability of financial incentives and affordable lending schemes for meeting\n    standards on energy efficiency, such as tax credits or green loans with favourable interest rates\n    for building renovation or modernisation.\n    \nEstablish public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy efficiency measures, public\n    transport and green mobility for cost savings and collective decarbonisation goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket incentives and fiscal policy\nWhile renewables have become increasingly competitive, they still face barriers compared to fossil fuels.\nRising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective. The choice of instrument and its design should consider: the nature of the solution\n(e.g. utility-scale, distributed, off-grid); level of development of the sector; power system organisational\nstructure; wider macroeconomic environment (e.g. impact of inflation and commodity price volatility);\nand broader policy objectives. It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below). This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk. A mechanism to allow for bilateral power\nprocurement between generators and private off-takers (such as industrial actors or corporates) can\nfurther strengthen the case for large deployment volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments.\n    \nIntroduce tax credits, levies and/or exemptions on import/export duties for key materials and\n    components in the renewable energy supply chain.\n    \nEnsure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains.\n    \nConsider the trade-offs between ‘lowest-price’ objectives, and other policy outcomes such as\n    socio-economic development, system integration and industry sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower market design and regulation\nThe world is entering a new era in which electricity systems will be increasingly dominated by zeromarginal-cost renewable technologies. Power markets must evolve and adapt to new market forces,\nsuch as corporate and industrial demand, and behind-the-meter (prosumer) generation. They must be\norganised in a way that incentivises new investment in renewable power generation and the flexibility to\nprovide reliable electricity at a level required for the 1.5°C pathway. This requires governments and other\nstakeholders to undertake a close examination of their power systems’ organisational structures, i.e. the\ninstitutions, processes and arrangements through which electricity services are exchanged and rewarded.\n\nWholesale power markets today are based on marginal cost pricing, where the most expensive\ngenerator (with the highest variable cost – typically fossil fuel-fired plants) determines electricity\nprices for the time period in which the market operates. This poses a number of challenges. As the\nshare of renewable power grows, wholesale spot markets will see increased price volatility, as periods\nof high renewable power generation push clearing prices in the wholesale market close to zero. When\nrenewable generation is less than demand, flexibility resources will be needed, potentially resulting in\nvery high prices at certain times.\n\nIf wholesale markets are the main source of revenue, the economic feasibility of new investments will\nplummet, as even existing generators will struggle to recover their initial capital costs whilst prospective\ninvestors realise diminishing returns. The paradigm that relies on free markets to incentivise power\nsupply investment decisions therefore needs to change.\n\nUltimately, a renewables-based power system requires enhanced flexibility; wholesale market design\nmust deliver this as well as providing the volume of renewable power needed. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy.\n\nPower system organisational structures must evolve to better align with energy policy and\ndecarbonisation goals. A “dual procurement” power market design could introduce long-term\ncontract mechanisms (e.g. Auctions, CfDs, PPAs) as the backbone of renewable power procurement,\nalongside a short-term market to dispatch flexible resources in an affordable way (IRENA, 2022a).\nThis holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system.\n\nThis transformation is partially underway, as auctions are becoming the preferred tool to procure\nrenewable energy, and wholesale markets are becoming more time and location granular (IRENA,\n2023a); but there are meaningful actions authorities can take now to ensure the acceleration of this trend.\n\nOne way to achieve enhanced system flexibility is for power markets to allow flexibility technologies\n(such as batteries and pumped hydropower) to provide ancillary services and be rewarded accordingly.\nAncillary services that serve to stabilise the grid network and will become increasingly important as\ndispatchable fossil fuel-based generation is phased out of the power mix. Today, many power systems\nreward the provision of energy but not ancillary services (where these services are not included in\ncontractual obligations). They therefore need to be appropriately valued and reflected in power system\ndesign. Valuing, pricing and procuring ancillary services astutely can bring new players to the grid, with\nadvantages for the whole power system. Examples of this include the enhanced frequency regulation\nauctions in the UK.\n\nTo achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This includes growth in distributed renewable energy\ngeneration systems – notably using solar PV – but also community solar and wind projects. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. Such measures can maximise the socio-economic benefits of renewable energy, insulate consumers from price volatility, create local supply\nchains and job opportunities, and enhance public perceptions of renewables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors.\nDesign auctions that balance competitive price discovery and long-term delivery of affordable\n    electricity. Auctions should also be run for sufficiently large and ambitious volumes, with\n    consistent, transparent tendering schedules to effectively foster competitive bidding.\nCreate a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix.\nRethink participation rules to allow new technologies to engage in the power market as flexibility\n    providers, including storage and demand side aggregators.\nEncourage investment in distributed renewable energy systems that allow consumers to become\n    “prosumers” by both using and producing clean electricity.\nReorganise power market structures to ensure policies for accelerating renewables deployment\n    account for system flexibility as well as sustainable returns to generators and investors.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamlining permitting\nThe time and cost constraints imposed by permitting procedures represent a major bottleneck\nimpacting the deployment of renewable energy projects in many countries. It is essential that permitting\nprocedures are fit-for-purpose and keep pace with renewable and climate targets, without compromising\nenvironmental and social impact standards. Experiences from the public and private sectors indicate\nthat best practices in permitting centre on four areas: administrative consolidation; digitalisation; policy\nsupport; and public engagement (European Commission, 2023).\n\nRenewable energy developers often need to consult numerous authorities at national, sub-national and\nsometimes village or prefecture level for the necessary permits to build a project. This process can be\nlengthy and extremely bureaucratic; for instance, the global average time required for permitting an\noffshore wind project is nine years. Onshore wind and utility-scale PV permitting processes can also\nbe long, although they are typically shorter than those for offshore wind. Similar obstacles exist for\nhydropower projects and smaller scale distributed projects for end consumers using renewable energy\ntechnologies like rooftop solar.\n\nCreating dedicated, centralised authorities is one way to streamline this process by ensuring developers\ncan refer to a single focal point. Countries like Denmark and the Philippines have already adopted a “one-stop shop” model to accelerate renewables deployment, but this model only works if it is adequately\nresourced. In addition, digitalised processes to submit and track applications would enable developments\nto progress more efficiently, while access to digitised local consenting and historical dispute records\nwould allow developers and authorities to screen sites that could be high-risk or unsuitable at an early\nstage (IRENA, 2023h).\n\nAn overarching best practice is the introduction of legislation mandating a maximum lead time for the\npermitting of renewable energy projects. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. Gaining social acceptance through\npublic engagement with relevant stakeholders is critical in the consenting and constructing stages of a\nrenewable energy project. This includes early and continuous consultation by authorities and developers\nwith local communities to communicate the benefits and considerations brought by a project to the area,\nas well as a transparent conflict resolution mechanism that sincerely addresses community concerns.\n\nComprehensive and efficient permitting frameworks represent a clear win-win, allowing renewable\nenergy development to expand this decade while cultivating acceptance with other interests in land and\nsea spaces. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023).\n\nRecent studies indicate that adopting best practices in permitting could cut consenting time for utility-scale wind and solar projects by more than half; for example, onshore wind farms could be permitted in\none year, offshore wind farms in 1.5 years and solar farms in as little as three months (ETC, 2023). This\nmakes permitting a high-impact enabler for the energy transition, where the necessary investment in\nresource, policy support and capacity will bring enormous value to countries in accelerating renewables\ngrowth and securing associated socio-economic and environmental benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023).\n\nThe energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. If not well managed, these\nmisalignments risk inequitable outcomes, which could sow doubt among policy makers and the\npublic concerning the advantages of the transition and lead to a fractured and unco-ordinated policy\nenvironment. Hence, there is a need for policies and measures that equitably distribute the benefits of\nthe energy transition and raise public awareness about these positive impacts.\n\nIn terms of jobs, sectoral misalignments may arise due to potential shifts in value and supply chains\nduring the energy transition. For instance, transitioning from fossil fuel power generation to solar energy\nmay shift the focus from fuel extraction to the semi-conductor industry. The impact on employment\ndepends on factors such as domestic production and labour productivity. Labour-market interventions\nencompass adequate employment services attuned to evolving circumstances and needs, along with\nmeasures to facilitate labour mobility (IRENA and ILO, 2023).\n\nCommunity benefit schemes span countries from Costa Rica to Mali and adopt a range of structures,\nfrom shared ownership of renewable assets to industry sponsorship of critical social and economic\ninfrastructure in host communities (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2020). Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions.\n\nAligning policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition will facilitate local\nvalue creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, and on a larger scale, ensure political\nand social stability as renewable energy expands.\n\nAs part of a sensitive and efficient permitting framework, renewable development must be well integrated\nwith the principles of sustainability, circular economy and reduced environmental impact – particularly\non land use and biodiversity. This also applies to enabling infrastructure, with grid expansion into remote\nand biodiverse areas requiring careful siting.\n\nAdopting sustainable end-of-life management policies, including waste management legislation, can\nhelp countries prepare for the anticipated volumes of equipment waste such as solar PV panels and\nbatteries. Research and development programmes across the energy and waste sectors, and industrial\nclusters, can help to further scale waste management infrastructure on a national or regional basis\n(IRENA and IEA, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign policies and measures with the principles of a just and equitable transition and foster local\n    value creation and socio-economic benefits in host communities, with a special focus on the\n    inclusion of marginalised groups.\nAnticipate labour market disruptions and establish programmes that can address workforce\n    gaps, minimise labour misalignments, create opportunities for targeted recruitment and labour\n    mobility, such as relocation grants, and establish social protection programmes.\nMinimise adverse environmental impacts and encourage nature-positive approaches, for example\n    by incentivising the uptake of sustainability standards for new renewable energy assets – such as\n    the Hydropower Sustainability Standard – as part of procurement schemes.\nEnsure the impacts of mining activities and the use of relatively scarce components are mitigated\n    through provisions for circular economy (end-of-life management, recycling and reuse of materials).\nGather information on renewables’ waste production through regular monitoring of waste\n    produced by technology, the composition of waste streams, installed system performance and the\n    causes and frequency of system failures, in order to adopt waste minimisation legislation suitable\n    for the pace and scale of the transition.\n\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\n\nGovernments have a crucial role to play in tripling renewable power capacity and placing the world on a\n1.5°C pathway. All too often, the energy transition discourse relegates governments’ responsibilities to\ncreating an enabling environment for private investments through predictable and stable policies, and\nthe creation of instruments that de-risk investment projects. Although this is crucial, a much broader and\nmore integrated policy approach is required to facilitate the adoption of an entire spectrum of energy\ntransition solutions needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and unlock its socio-economic benefits (Figure 8).\n\nGovernments need to be far more engaged in shaping and guiding the energy transition, including through\npolicies for ambitious public investment programmes and sufficient forward-planning for renewables\nscale-up, system integration and grid build-out.\n\nCross-cutting approaches covering all renewable technologies, electrification technologies and others\nare needed to facilitate the energy transition (e.g. energy storage), include enabling policies that set\nambitions and send clear signals to stakeholders, eliminate distortions, incentivise the uptake of solutions\nand facilitate access to affordable financing. They also include policies that ensure the integration of\nrenewables within energy systems, economies, nature and societies, as well as specific deployment\npolicies for various technologies. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand.\n\nTransitioning to a renewables-based economy may also bring challenges in the form of financing gaps,\nlabour market disruptions and energy sector insecurity. These misalignments, if not well-managed,\nrisk inequitable outcomes and a slower pace of the energy transition. Therefore, a set of structural and\njust transition policies, along with the creation of strong institutions to ensure policy co-ordination and\ncohesion, is required to manage potential misalignments.\n\nFinally, a holistic global policy framework that entails international collaboration including North-South\nand South-South co-operation is needed to bring stakeholders from countries around the world together\nto commit to a just transition that leaves no one behind and strengthens international finance flows,\ncapacities and technologies in an equitable manner.\n\nThis section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits.\n\nFIGURE 8 The IRENA holistic policy framework for a just and inclusive energy transition\n\nBased on: (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nGovernments have a crucial role to play in tripling renewable power capacity and placing the world on a\n1.5°C pathway.

Enhanced energy efficiency is a crucial enabler for making high\nlevels of end-use electrification feasible and affordable. Measures related to reducing energy demand\nand improving efficiency are needed across all end-use sectors.\n\nMinimum energy performance standards (MEPS) can support industrial, commercial and residential\nusers to procure and switch to more energy efficient appliances or equipment such as electric heating/\ncooling technologies. Building codes can set energy performance requirements by specifying insulation\nstandards, thereby reducing heating and cooling demands. They can also specify greenhouse gas\nemission targets and carbon footprints. For renovation, in particular, codes can be coupled with financial\nincentives.\n\nIt is also important to address prevailing challenges associated with building ownership structures,\nequitable access and benefit-sharing of energy efficiency investments and policies. “Green loans” could\ncarry lower interest rates and protect low-income energy consumers from energy price fluctuations\nand inflationary environments. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures.\n\nIn the transport sector, significant improvements can be achieved by promoting energy efficient mobility\n(e.g. public transport such as railways, metros and buses, and car-sharing), as well as active (nonmotorised) transport such as cycling and walking in urban areas. Public campaigns can be undertaken by\nnational and local governments to encourage green mobility modes. Other policies, such as differentiated\nparking fees and highway tolls, can encourage a shift to public transport, complemented by dedicated\ndriving lanes for car-sharing.

Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective.

It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below). This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk.

This will help to provide predictability\nfor investors, developers and supply chain actors, while enabling public authorities to efficiently plan for\ngrid integration, workforce development and demand-side management.\n\nWhere procurement is facilitated by CfDs, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or other mechanisms,\nthese should meet international standards for bankability in terms of their coverage of dispute\nmechanisms, grid connection delays and curtailment risk. A mechanism to allow for bilateral power\nprocurement between generators and private off-takers (such as industrial actors or corporates) can\nfurther strengthen the case for large deployment volumes.\n\nWhile renewables have become increasingly competitive, they still face barriers compared to fossil fuels.\nRising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nA progressive, supportive fiscal system can be achieved by eliminating market structures that favour the\nuptake of fossil fuels (e.g. phasing out direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies) and reflecting environmental\nand social costs associated with the use of fossil fuels through taxation or other mechanisms. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTaxes and levies, subsidies or exemptions on duties for imported/exported components required by the\nrenewables sector could kickstart private investment in renewables projects and manufacturing activity.\nCountries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition.\n\nThe energy transition will only succeed if it is both deep and broad. Therefore, careful consideration of\nbroader social and equity issues is also vital, particularly for low-income populations for whom energy\nconstitutes a larger share of household expenditure. Financial support drawn from general taxation, tax\non windfall profits and ongoing taxation of fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing revenue can\nall be used to support the transition.\n\nRegulatory policies, such as tariff-based procurement mechanisms – e.g. feed-in tariffs or auction\nschemes using a contracts for difference (CfD) mechanism, which provide stable prices over long periods\n– are also effective. The choice of instrument and its design should consider: the nature of the solution\n(e.g. utility-scale, distributed, off-grid); level of development of the sector; power system organisational\nstructure; wider macroeconomic environment (e.g. impact of inflation and commodity price volatility);\nand broader policy objectives. It is important that price levels for public procurement schemes – and\ncompetitive auctions in particular – balance cost-efficient electricity supply to consumers with healthy,\nsustainable supply chain development for the renewables sector. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030.\n\nPrivate investments will continue to play a major role in the energy transition. As such, it is vital that\npolicy makers ensure a policy and regulatory environment that de-risks investments and unlocks private\ncapital flows to the renewables sector. Key factors include setting clear and ambitious capacity targets\nwith a rolling schedule for procurement, as well as ensuring large volumes of land/seabed are made\navailable – where under government control – for renewables development, and that permitting and\nenvironmental processes are efficient and streamlined (see below).

This\nmakes permitting a high-impact enabler for the energy transition, where the necessary investment in\nresource, policy support and capacity will bring enormous value to countries in accelerating renewables\ngrowth and securing associated socio-economic and environmental benefits.\n\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\nCreate a centralised authority to oversee permitting of renewables projects, consolidating\n    information and requirements from all relevant authorities and issuing permits according to a\n    transparent timeline.\nMandate and enforce maximum lead times for applicants and authorities to complete the permitting\n    stages of renewable energy projects, with discretionary additional time under exceptional\n    circumstances for more complex projects.\nAllocate greater resources to permitting authorities, including human resources and investment\n    in digitalisation and open-source databases, such as for land titles, mapping data and historical\n    dispute records.\nConsider adopting efficient legal challenge processes by implementing a limited time window for\n    raising disputes and establishing an authority to screen challenges, balancing public interests.\nExpedite processes for developers repowering assets on existing sites and provide the flexibility\n    to adjust a proposed infrastructural, technological or social approach to projects without having\n    to reapply for new permits.\n\nReducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation.

Energy supply chains have become a priority agenda for policy makers, as demand and\ncompetition for critical raw materials, rare earth elements and production capacity become more acute.\n\nWithout well-functioning and cost-efficient industrial supply chains, the energy transition will not\nmaterialise. If not well managed, competition, security and scarcity challenges in renewable energy\nsupply chains could lead to a disorderly transition, characterised by slower rates of renewables\ndeployment at inflated costs. A mismatch between supply and demand for several critical minerals is\nalready evident, with particularly high levels observed for lithium – a key material required for the shortduration energy storage and electric transport sectors (IRENA, 2023e). Bottlenecks for key components\nin the wind industry – e.g. nacelles, blades and gearboxes – are set to emerge by the second half of this\ndecade in Asia and the Americas (GWEC, 2023). High concentration risk in the global renewables supply\nchain also raises the prospect of price or security of supply uncertainty in the future.\n\nRobust and resilient global supply chains are required to support a 1.5°C pathway. The mining and\nprocessing of critical materials including lithium, copper, nickel and other rare earth metals are\nconstrained within specific geographies, exposing these supply chains to geopolitical tensions and\nconcentration risks (IRENA, 2023e). Policy makers should work with the private sector to identify\nproduction gaps and supply chain weaknesses on a national and regional basis, and generate strategies\nto reinforce supply chain security.\n\nSocially responsible procurement is another key issue, where many critical materials and components\nrefined or manufactured in one country are imported by others for use in the renewables sector. It will\nbe vital to ensure supply chains – in the mining and processing segments in particular – are managed\nwith respect to fair trade, and high environmental, social governance (ESG) and sustainability standards.\nResilient supply chains are also key to sustaining the cost-value proposition of renewable energy around\nthe world.\n\nAs countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. The need for local value creation and regional supply chain\ninvestment must be carefully balanced with reducing trade barriers for goods and services central to\nthe renewables renewables industry. This will be key to avoid intensifying supply chain bottlenecks\nand making renewables less cost-competitive, while maximising socio-economic benefits.\n\nMultilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. This will require governments to work with industry, civil society and other stakeholders to\nensure supply chain planning is conducted through a wider lens that encompasses national interests,\ncost-effective and socially responsible sourcing, long-term social and environmental sustainability, and\nclimate and renewable energy targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate with the renewables industry on industrial development reviews and plans for the\n    transition that are sustainable, achievable, and adequately mitigate risk of supply insecurity\n    and price volatility. Approaches include diversifying sources of production, anticipating critical\n    production gaps and localising value chains.\nEnsure socially responsible procurement of renewables by encouraging uptake of sustainable\n    supply chain assurance schemes, such as the Solar Stewardship Initiative.\nIncentivise public–private partnerships and investment in circularity to encourage reuse of\n    materials and a circular economy approach to project development, which can help to reduce\n    concentration risk and supply insecurity of critical materials.\nCo-operate with international fora and financial institutions to safeguard international trade\n    corridors for materials and components for key renewable energy technologies.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation, training and capacity-building\nBuilding a skilled energy transition workforce requires measures to both expand the talent pipeline and\nenhance the quality of education and training provisions.\n\nEarly exposure to renewable energy topics and careers is vital for sparking interest in pursuing a career in the\nsector, but also to increase social acceptance by a knowledgeable citizenry. The curricula at higher education\nand vocational training institutions must reflect the skills and competences required by the transition.\n\nIn addition to strengthening the content of education and training programmes, it is also important to\nenhance the instructional methods used. For example, experiential learning methods where students are\nencouraged to develop problem-solving strategies can help to prepare learners for jobs in the constantly\nevolving renewable energy sector, where independent knowledge-seeking will often be necessary.\n\nFacilitating collaboration between government agencies on workforce development, industry and\neducational institutions will contribute to more co-ordinated skill-matching efforts. It is vital to consider\nhow a just transition can respond to potential labour displacement in the existing energy sector workforce\nand re-skill or upskill appropriately.\n\nTargeted measures to train, recruit and retain women and other underrepresented or marginalised groups\n(including older workers, ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities and those on a low\nincome) will ensure the dividends of the transition are enjoyed by all. This inclusion can be implemented\nthrough early exposure to renewable energy leadership and career pathways, targeted scholarships,\ngovernment-funded training opportunities, and industry apprenticeship and mentorship schemes.\n\nOutside the renewables industry, it is equally important to ensure sufficiently skilled and trained workers\nare available in government departments concerned with international trade, supply chains, electric\ncharging infrastructure and land use. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government.\n\nCarefully designed public-private partnerships (PPPs) can also play a crucial role in improving overall\ntraining quality while meeting sectoral labour requirements, promoting national skill standards and\nmatchmaking communities with workplace training opportunities. In addition to improving training\ncontent, PPPs can also play a role in shifting the financing of training provisions to a more integrated\napproach that incorporates multiple funding mechanisms including payroll-based training levies, tax\nincentives, scholarships and donations, vouchers and student loans (Dunbar, 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlign workforce planning among all stakeholders, including labour agencies, labour unions, the\n    wider energy industry and educational institutions, to identify critical skill gaps and workforce\n    needs in advance, and to design skill-building strategies accordingly.\nProvide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition.\nEnsure energy transition goals are reflected in educational programmes and resources, such\n    as university curricula, vocational training institutions, occupational health and safety training\n    institutions, and professional education programmes.\nBuild the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce.\nInvest in reskilling and upskilling measures for vulnerable communities and those in fossil fuel\n    industries to ensure the employment benefits of the transition are extended to a wide subset of\n    the population. Such measures need to be embedded in broader regional economic revitalisation\n    programmes and investments.\n\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\n\nBuilding resilient supply chains\nThe vulnerabilities of key energy industries to logistics bottlenecks, commodity price volatility, trade\nbarriers, and commodity and component import dependencies have become increasingly apparent in\nrecent years.

However, investments remain focused on a few technologies and concentrated\nin a limited number of countries. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). This trend is reflected in renewable power\ncapacity additions, as all of Africa accounted for less than 2% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA,\n2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023).\n\nTo achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. It is equally important that investments to modernise power grids and enhance operational flexibility\nincrease from the annual average investment of USD 274 billion in 2022 to USD 605 billion by 2030. 10 \n\nThis presents a dual challenge: 1) how to scale existing investment flows in countries and technologies;\nand 2) how to ensure these investment flows reach countries that are currently underserved by the\nenergy transition. Efforts to address the much higher cost of capital faced by developing economies –\nas much as three to five times more than in most OECD countries – are also needed (IRENA, 2023f). A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects.\n\nRepurposing public capital from the fossil fuel sector, including both direct investments and financial\nsupport in the form of subsidies, can help accelerate progress towards unlocking the capital required.\nThis public money can then catalyse private capital flows, amplifying investment efforts towards the\nUSD 35 trillion required (for the energy transition as a whole) in the remainder of this decade.\n\nFor example, public financial flows to fossil fuels in the G20 countries alone reached USD 1.4 trillion in\n2022 – more than double 2019 levels. Moreover, G20 governments supported the global fossil fuel industry\nthrough international aid, export credit support and concessional financing (such as equity, grants, loans\nand loan guarantees) at an average of USD 50 billion per year from 2019 to 2021 (IISD, 2023).\n\nPublic funding is urgently needed for basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to\ndrive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as industry and transport,\nor synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investment is scarce. Without this, the gap in\ninvestment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen, to the detriment of\nbillions of people and the success of a just and inclusive global energy transition.\n\nA more comprehensive definition of risk around investing in energy assets is needed. A narrow focus on\nthe return risk to investors must expand to encompass environmental and social risks. This approach,\nwhich should be exercised through rigorous international benchmarks and protocols for investment,\ncan also help to shift funding from fossil fuel assets to the renewables sector. With limited public funds\navailable in the developing world, the international community must step up.\n\nPublic funds (domestic or through international collaboration) must flow through intermediaries\n(e.g. governments, development finance institutions and global funds such as the Green Climate Fund).\nSuch instruments should channel public funds towards policies that support structural change and a\njust transition. Furthermore, these instruments should be designed progressively to ensure economic\nbenefits are shared in an equitable way.\n\nFinally, public investments are needed for economic interventions to support a more equitable\ndistribution of benefits from large-scale renewables growth. National carbon pricing revenues,\nfor example, could be redirected to support clean, affordable electricity access for lower-income\nhouseholds on a progressive basis.\n\nIt is also important to actively engage the private sector, given that public financing alone will not be\nanywhere near sufficient to address the huge investment needs for the global energy transition. The public\nsector can play a catalysing role by providing a conducive and predictable enabling environment for the\nlong-term investment decisions made in the private sector. Also, governments can set the right conditions\nfor private sector actors to build and finance a viable pipeline of energy transition-oriented projects.\n\nFor example, blended finance structures would allow concessional public finance, and even philanthropic\ngrant-based finance, to improve the risk-return profile of an investment, so that private capital is\nattracted at lower cost and/or better terms (IRENA, 2023g). Banks can also pool loans to relatively\nsmall renewables projects into a securitised product aimed at impact-minded investors, including retail\ninvestors who otherwise have few avenues to earn returns while funding renewables deployment (GFMA\nand BCG, 2020). The resulting financial portfolio of projects would reduce the perceived risk associated\nwith its individual components. Such an approach would require a level of contract standardisation to\nenable the bundling of small projects (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nWhile there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. In addition to the measures described above, capital mobilisation schemes like green\nbonds for renewables, as well as international coalition-building to guide distribution of renewables\ninvestment between the Global North and Global South, will be crucial to ensure renewables can\nequitably scale this decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation).\n    \nPromote the adoption of a comprehensive definition of investment risk within public and private\n    institutions that encompasses environmental and social externalities, thereby aligning financial\n    decision-making with broader public and social goals.\n    \nCollaborate with public and private sector actors to develop innovative, context-specific financing\n    and business models that address renewable energy financing gaps in underinvested countries.\n    This involves utilising blended finance, green bonds, financial aggregation, and innovative risk\n    mitigation tools tailored to each country’s unique needs.\n    \nDirect the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access.\n    \nFor Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. A fractured and unaligned approach to renewables deployment will lead\nto missed opportunities for countries to accelerate growth and enjoy the benefits of clean electricity,\nparticularly in the Global South. Public and private stakeholders alike are responsible for enhancing\nparticipation in multilateral initiatives that can facilitate knowledge-sharing and capacity-building to\ndeliver a just transition via a 1.5°C pathway.\n\nWith the lion’s share of renewables investment benefiting developed economies, it will be important to\nstrengthen North-South and South-South collaboration to maximise the social and economic benefits\nfrom clean industrialisation. Country blocs such as the G20 can be powerful coalitions to mobilise support\nand investment around the global renewable energy target and its key enablers.\n\nMobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables.\n\nAdvanced economies are better positioned to mobilise public financing, but global policy frameworks are\nnecessary to secure affordable funding to underpin the energy transition at the national level elsewhere. In\nemerging economies, just transition funds need to be established to support plant closures, communities\nin transition, repurposing/rehabilitation, and retraining and skilling, among other priorities. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. A high proportion of the public funding mobilised will need to\nbe grant-based, avoiding the danger of adding to already high debt burdens faced by many countries.\n\nInternational climate finance has a key role to play in providing the public financing necessary for a just and\nfair energy transition. Its function will vary depending on the context; fossil fuel-dependent communities\nand countries will require targeted efforts to unwind lock-ins to the fossil fuel economy and plan an\nalternative development trajectory based on renewable power generation and economic activities (CPR,\n2021). Countries where mitigation requirements consistent with climate targets go beyond their fair\nshare of the global mitigation burden will require support to trigger the needed collaborative framework,\nleapfrog to renewables-based energy systems and reap their share of the transition benefits.\n\nIt will be important to ensure definitions, standards, governance and investment protocols for the\nenergy transition are fairly aligned to effectively funnel capital to renewables development that meets\nhigh social and environmental standards. From green taxonomy to emissions reduction standards, the\nneed for common ground in the renewables and green hydrogen sectors will be increasingly helpful for\nmultinational investors, companies and civil society actors to navigate the transition.\n\nInternational collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. There are many areas for continued innovation and learning, from DSM\nto LDES to green hydrogen derivatives – all of which will have a positive impact on decarbonisation.\nPlatforms for knowledge-sharing and imparting lessons learnt, such as the IRENA Collaborative Frameworks or the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), are important vehicles to ensure ambition\ncan be transformed into effective action at country level. This is particularly important for those countries\nthat are most vulnerable to the severe impacts of climate change, and so face more significant challenges\nto protect communities without adequate support for adaptation measures (UNCTAD, 2022).\n\nFinally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy.\nThe ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). Scaling up grid planning will support a more economic and\nsustainable approach to the transition, enabling better system balancing and resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nURGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. This requires public-private platforms that bring governments together with financial institutions, renewable energy\n    developers and supply chain actors, civil society and other relevant stakeholders.\n    \nEnsure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth.\nEncourage robust standards and investment protocols for the transition that can allocate capital\n    to high-impact solutions in the renewables sector. This includes strict emissions standards as part\n    of green taxonomies to guide a capital shift away from fossil fuels and accelerate the development\n    of a green hydrogen sector.\nParticipate in platforms for knowledge-sharing and exchange on renewable energy research,\n    innovation and best practices across policy areas including auction design and corporate\n    procurement. Technology exchange and harmonised standards can also build the resilience of\n    the global renewable energy supply chain by achieving cost efficiencies, supporting best-in-class\n    asset development and lowering barriers to market.\nIntensify co-operation with neighbouring governments and grid authorities on regional grid\n    planning and opportunities for building interconnections, cross-border power trading, regional\n    power pools and innovative approaches like meshed grids.\n\nSCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023).

A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects.\n\nRepurposing public capital from the fossil fuel sector, including both direct investments and financial\nsupport in the form of subsidies, can help accelerate progress towards unlocking the capital required.\nThis public money can then catalyse private capital flows, amplifying investment efforts towards the\nUSD 35 trillion required (for the energy transition as a whole) in the remainder of this decade.\n\nFor example, public financial flows to fossil fuels in the G20 countries alone reached USD 1.4 trillion in\n2022 – more than double 2019 levels. Moreover, G20 governments supported the global fossil fuel industry\nthrough international aid, export credit support and concessional financing (such as equity, grants, loans\nand loan guarantees) at an average of USD 50 billion per year from 2019 to 2021 (IISD, 2023).\n\nPublic funding is urgently needed for basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to\ndrive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as industry and transport,\nor synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investment is scarce. Without this, the gap in\ninvestment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen, to the detriment of\nbillions of people and the success of a just and inclusive global energy transition.\n\nA more comprehensive definition of risk around investing in energy assets is needed. A narrow focus on\nthe return risk to investors must expand to encompass environmental and social risks. This approach,\nwhich should be exercised through rigorous international benchmarks and protocols for investment,\ncan also help to shift funding from fossil fuel assets to the renewables sector. With limited public funds\navailable in the developing world, the international community must step up.\n\nPublic funds (domestic or through international collaboration) must flow through intermediaries\n(e.g. governments, development finance institutions and global funds such as the Green Climate Fund).\nSuch instruments should channel public funds towards policies that support structural change and a\njust transition. Furthermore, these instruments should be designed progressively to ensure economic\nbenefits are shared in an equitable way.\n\nFinally, public investments are needed for economic interventions to support a more equitable\ndistribution of benefits from large-scale renewables growth. National carbon pricing revenues,\nfor example, could be redirected to support clean, affordable electricity access for lower-income\nhouseholds on a progressive basis.\n\nIt is also important to actively engage the private sector, given that public financing alone will not be\nanywhere near sufficient to address the huge investment needs for the global energy transition. The public\nsector can play a catalysing role by providing a conducive and predictable enabling environment for the\nlong-term investment decisions made in the private sector. Also, governments can set the right conditions\nfor private sector actors to build and finance a viable pipeline of energy transition-oriented projects.\n\nFor example, blended finance structures would allow concessional public finance, and even philanthropic\ngrant-based finance, to improve the risk-return profile of an investment, so that private capital is\nattracted at lower cost and/or better terms (IRENA, 2023g). Banks can also pool loans to relatively\nsmall renewables projects into a securitised product aimed at impact-minded investors, including retail\ninvestors who otherwise have few avenues to earn returns while funding renewables deployment (GFMA\nand BCG, 2020). The resulting financial portfolio of projects would reduce the perceived risk associated\nwith its individual components. Such an approach would require a level of contract standardisation to\nenable the bundling of small projects (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nWhile there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. In addition to the measures described above, capital mobilisation schemes like green\nbonds for renewables, as well as international coalition-building to guide distribution of renewables\ninvestment between the Global North and Global South, will be crucial to ensure renewables can\nequitably scale this decade.\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). However, investments remain focused on a few technologies and concentrated\nin a limited number of countries. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). This trend is reflected in renewable power\ncapacity additions, as all of Africa accounted for less than 2% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA,\n2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023).\n\nTo achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022.

This reduction will require a step change in action on both the supply and demand sides\nacross the entire energy system.\nTotal global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. This will\nneed to be complemented by a phase-down in fossil fuel generation, physical infrastructure upgrades,\nmodernisation and expansion, as well as enhanced grid flexibility.\nOn the demand side, energy efficiency improvements will be key. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This will not only require technological solutions but also behavioural\nchanges, necessitating greater awareness and broad support from communities and individuals for the\nenergy transition.\nThe twin goals of tripling renewable power and doubling energy efficiency by the end of this decade\nare undoubtedly challenging; but they are achievable. Their realisation requires urgent action by all\nstakeholders – governments (national, regional and local), international organisations, industry,\nfinance institutions and energy end-users (from big industrial users to individual households). The\nsooner we act, the sooner we will unlock the net economic, environmental and socio-economic benefits\nof an energy transition pathway that is consistent with the Paris Agreement goals.\n\nThis report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. They also need to make sure that the energy transition fosters socio-economic\nbenefits and minimises adverse environmental impacts. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth.

This will\nneed to be complemented by a phase-down in fossil fuel generation, physical infrastructure upgrades,\nmodernisation and expansion, as well as enhanced grid flexibility.\nOn the demand side, energy efficiency improvements will be key.

  "summary": "KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n \n\n\n\n\nTOTAL GLOBAL RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY WILL NEED TO\nTRIPLE BY 2030 to reach more than 11 000 GW under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario\nin the World Energy Transitions Outlook, with solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind\npower accounting for about 90% of renewable energy capacity additions. ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in\n            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and\n            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera\n            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency\nOur mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,\n            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency\n            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the\n            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is\n            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with\n            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is\n            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris\n            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing\n            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;\n            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted\n            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and\n            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and\n            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth. COP28 provides a\nclear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit\nto tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in\n            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and\n            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera\n            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency\nOur mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,\n            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency\n            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the\n            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is\n            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with\n            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is\n            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris\n            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing\n            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;\n            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted\n            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and\n            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and\n            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth. COP28 provides a\nclear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit\nto tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in\n            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and\n            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera\n            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency\nOur mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,\n            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency\n            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the\n            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is\n            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with\n            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is\n            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris\n            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing\n            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;\n            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted\n            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and\n            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and\n            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of\n551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual\npower generation capacity additions this decade. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth. COP28 provides a\nclear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit\nto tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in\n            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and\n            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera\n            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency\nOur mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,\n            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency\n            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the\n            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is\n            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with\n            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is\n            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris\n            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing\n            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;\n            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted\n            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and\n            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and\n            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable\n            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure\n            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity\n            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful\n            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –\nwill need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power\naccounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy\nintensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C\nScenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the\nprovision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy\nefficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\nPOLICY AND REGULATION\nSUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES\nFINANCE\nINTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,\npolicy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector\nplanning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory\nframeworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from\nfossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable\ndistribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global\nSouth. COP28 provides a\nclear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit\nto tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets\nwith specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building\ncodes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial\nincentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy\nefficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and\ncollective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in\naddressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER\nCAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy\nTransitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges\nand plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development\nstrategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this\nwould serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable\nenergy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in\nenergy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the\nworld back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 \nThe global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy\nindustry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,\nparticularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy\nauthorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to\ntriple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate\nchange space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the\nGlobal Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet\nthese renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement\nmeasures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce\nexposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative\nglobal installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual\nenergy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to\nachieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,\nsustainable and modern energy for all.

This would set the stage to\n            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy\n            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable\n            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far\n            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing\n            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability\n            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up\n            renewable energy.

According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030\n\nNotes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made.

Currently, despite vast potential,\nmany developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems\nand related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable\nenergy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the\neconomic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the\ncompetitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power\nin reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of\naffordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of\nrenewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and\nwind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting\nnew operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response\nschemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with\nreservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand\nwith supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by\ngrids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of\nrenewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from\nthe record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered\nby renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer\nscale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an\nurgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –\nparticularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV\nand wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021\nto 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in\nthe current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,\nincluding 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW\naverage annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable\npower technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately\n(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential\nand more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases\nin renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;\nrenewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit\nin developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY\r\n \n\n\n\n\nA rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also\naim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient\ntechnologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 \n) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is\nlargely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and\nelectric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised\nenergy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and\ntransportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role\nin keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels\n(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should\ndouble by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy\nsecurity and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient\ninvestments are made.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,\nworkforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be\naligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently\nintegrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and\nrenewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;\nshape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and\nenvironmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,\naccording to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the\nadoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy\nefficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as\naccess to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important\nrole in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies\nwould improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical\ninfrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist\nthose countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas\nmust carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable\npower and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds\n    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling\n    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green\n    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment\n    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby\n    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable\n    energy supply chains. Policy makers must\ntherefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate\nincreasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet\n    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that\n    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy\n    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities\n    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of\n    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate\nchange through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best\npractices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits\nScaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic\nbenefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health\nimprovements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated\n13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of\nmillions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments\nthat may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and\npolicies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment\nwhile boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of\nincreasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology\ntransfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging\nmarkets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will\nbe important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the\nrenewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development\nstandards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the\ninterconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities\nbrought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more\nco-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –\n    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical\n    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition\n    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the\n    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth.

The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION\r\n \n\n\n\n\nWind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power\nworldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse\nrange of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including\nhydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower grids\nInvestments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now\nsignificantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries\nneed to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid\ninvestments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system\ncosts of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage\nWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure\nthe electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal\nenergy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies\n(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy\nin chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies\n\nBased on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or\neven seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is\ngreater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy\ngrids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,\nprovided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are\navailable (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy\nnetworks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,\n2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022).

This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable\nenergy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based\npower system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become\nactive participants in the energy system. This will\nrequire electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale\nrenewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through\nconnection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs.

Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for\ninstance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year\nfor repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects.

SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 \r\n \n\n\n\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRedirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,\n    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive\n    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives\n    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income\n    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that\n    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the\n    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration\nInternational collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and\nenergy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to\nexisting multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global\nrenewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together\nthrough schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives\nand credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and\ndevelopment finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing\nthat can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in\nwhich just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other\nsuch initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure\nthat best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable\nenergy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,\nas grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean\nelectricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy\nresources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,\n    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured\n    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy\n    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8\n\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high\n(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment\nbenefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of\nthe global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable\npower generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in\n2022. A\nsubstantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and\ninnovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment\nand ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear\nthat both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of\nprojects by 2030.
