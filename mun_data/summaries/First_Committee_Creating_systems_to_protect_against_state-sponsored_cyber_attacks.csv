2️⃣ Access Now’s Zhixin Liu and Raman Jit Singh Chima set the tone for our return to the region after a decade: “The Asia Pacific region [...] arguably, [...] is already the present of our internet. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)

5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. 6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”

7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. +4

🎊 Here are our highlights from the #RightsCon2025 Opening Ceremony:

1️⃣ We were warmly welcomed by Bi-khim Hsiao, Vice President of Taiwan: “Welcome to Taipei, welcome to RightsCon, and may this summit be a catalyst for change, and may our collective experts inspire a more open, inclusive and rights respecting digital future for all.” 

2️⃣ Access Now’s Zhixin Liu and Raman Jit Singh Chima set the tone for our return to the region after a decade: “The Asia Pacific region [...] arguably, [...] is already the present of our internet. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)

5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. 6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”

7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. +4

The work does not end here—it continues in every battle for digital rights, in every demand for accountability, in every voice that refuses to be silenced. #RightsCon2025 #DigitalRights #CallToAction #ResistAndMobilize #FundingJustice

🎊 Here are our highlights from the #RightsCon2025 Opening Ceremony:

1️⃣ We were warmly welcomed by Bi-khim Hsiao, Vice President of Taiwan: “Welcome to Taipei, welcome to RightsCon, and may this summit be a catalyst for change, and may our collective experts inspire a more open, inclusive and rights respecting digital future for all.” 

2️⃣ Access Now’s Zhixin Liu and Raman Jit Singh Chima set the tone for our return to the region after a decade: “The Asia Pacific region [...] arguably, [...] is already the present of our internet. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)

5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. 6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”

7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. +4

🎊 Here are our highlights from the #RightsCon2025 Opening Ceremony:

1️⃣ We were warmly welcomed by Bi-khim Hsiao, Vice President of Taiwan: “Welcome to Taipei, welcome to RightsCon, and may this summit be a catalyst for change, and may our collective experts inspire a more open, inclusive and rights respecting digital future for all.” 

2️⃣ Access Now’s Zhixin Liu and Raman Jit Singh Chima set the tone for our return to the region after a decade: “The Asia Pacific region [...] arguably, [...] is already the present of our internet. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)

5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. 6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”

7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. +4

🎊 Here are our highlights from the #RightsCon2025 Opening Ceremony:

1️⃣ We were warmly welcomed by Bi-khim Hsiao, Vice President of Taiwan: “Welcome to Taipei, welcome to RightsCon, and may this summit be a catalyst for change, and may our collective experts inspire a more open, inclusive and rights respecting digital future for all.” 

2️⃣ Access Now’s Zhixin Liu and Raman Jit Singh Chima set the tone for our return to the region after a decade: “The Asia Pacific region [...] arguably, [...] is already the present of our internet. The people of Sudan shouldn’t be standing alone.” (Htaike Htaike Aung, ED at Myanmar Internet Project)

5️⃣ Laila Souif, mother of Alaa Abd El Fattah, activist and blogger, joined us on day 149 of her hunger strike, as RightsCon’s participants echoed Laila’ s plea to ‘Never give up on Alaa's freedom.' As always, we call to #FreeAlaa immediately. 6️⃣ Maha Hussaini, award-winning journalist from Palestine, spoke about the accountability of social media platforms in the genocide in Gaza: “we also need to advocate against the illegal practices and restrictions imposed by social media companies against victims by silencing their voices and contributing to these war crimes imposed against them.”

7️⃣ Marwa Fatafta, MENA Policy and Advocacy Director at @AccessNow, spoke with Htaike Htaike Aung and Sadaf Khan (lead of Safety for Voices project @apc_network), on (AI) technologies during war and military conflict and platform accountability. +4

Israel’s attack burned Palestine Today reporter Hilmi al-Faqaawi to death along with another man named Yousef al-Khazindar. ‘Nothing new in … crimes against journalists’
More than 200 journalists and media workers have been killed by Israeli forces since October 2023, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, making it the deadliest ever conflict for journalists. “What connects us … is more than just work.”
Experts told Al Jazeera in September that Israel’s killing of journalists in Gaza shows a clear pattern of targeting journalists. “This isn’t the first time during this war, from October 7 to today, whether in Lebanon or Gaza, the Israeli army has directly targeted journalists’ centres. “This, of course, according to international law, is a war crime, and nothing justifies it.”

Other journalists killed in Gaza since the start of the war include Al Jazeera Mubasher journalist Hossam Shabat and Al Jazeera reporter Hamza Dahdouh, son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh. Advertisement 
Since October 7, 2023, Israel has killed at least 50,700 people in Gaza, most of whom are children or women and, therefore, not considered members of “terrorist groups” in Israel’s classification. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate gave a news conference on Monday, calling for international accountability for Israel’s crimes against journalists in Gaza. Is there anything more horrific than this scene to move people?” Advertisement 
“This isn’t the first time someone has burned to death, and it’s not the first time journalists have been directly targeted,” Shaat said. “We still don’t know whose turn it will be next.”

Experts told Al Jazeera in September that Israel’s killing of journalists in Gaza shows a clear pattern of targeting journalists. “This isn’t the first time during this war, from October 7 to today, whether in Lebanon or Gaza, the Israeli army has directly targeted journalists’ centres. “This, of course, according to international law, is a war crime, and nothing justifies it.”

HELPLINE
Our 24/7 Digital Security Helpline offers real-time, direct technical assistance and advice to civil society groups and activists, media organizations, journalists and bloggers, and human rights defenders. ADVOCACY
We act quickly when people need it most, leveraging innovative campaign and digital engagement tactics, bold visual advocacy, legal know-how, and dynamic policy work. We have dedicated centers covering Africa, Asia Pacific, Central Asia and Eastern Europe, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, and North America. A HELPLINE ACROSS THE GLOBE
Our emergency response team grew into the Digital Security Helpline, which went public in 2013 to provide individuals and organizations most at-risk with 24/7 real-time technical support. ‘Meet the team’

Who else did Israel kill in this incident? “The available information indicates that the first team was killed by Israeli forces on 23 March, and that other emergency and aid crews were struck one after another over several hours as they searched for their missing colleagues,” a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Palestine said. Referring to Israeli soldiers firing at clearly marked ambulances and UN vehicles, Shoshani wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”, not clarifying what was meant by “uncoordinated vehicle”.

Shoshani also claimed without evidence that “terrorists” were hidden amid the rescue workers and that “[Israeli] forces eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who took part in the October 7 massacre, along with eight other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.”

Della Longa said that, for a whole week, the IFRC, PRCS, ICRC and the UN made appeals to Israeli authorities to enter the area to investigate.

Nine Palestine Red Crescent (PRCS) medics in ambulances, as well as some Civil Defence workers, went to help people in Rafah, Gaza, and disappeared on March 23 after coming under attack from Israeli forces. Here’s everything we know about how Israel killed these first responders in Gaza:

Israeli forces killed them. “In the early hours of Sunday, 23 March, our Palestine Red Crescent colleagues were entering the area of al-Hashaashin, Rafah to save lives and came under fire,” Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), told Al Jazeera.

The bodies of 14 murdered people were found in a shallow mass grave, according to the PRCS. “The available information indicates that the first team was killed by Israeli forces on 23 March, and that other emergency and aid crews were struck one after another over several hours as they searched for their missing colleagues,” a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Palestine said. There’s a UN vehicle here, …[an] Israeli forces bulldozer has buried them.”

The Israeli army’s international spokesperson, Nadav Shoshani, said the medics had not been killed deliberately. Referring to Israeli soldiers firing at clearly marked ambulances and UN vehicles, Shoshani wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”, not clarifying what was meant by “uncoordinated vehicle”.

Shoshani also claimed without evidence that “terrorists” were hidden amid the rescue workers and that “[Israeli] forces eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who took part in the October 7 massacre, along with eight other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.”

Della Longa said that, for a whole week, the IFRC, PRCS, ICRC and the UN made appeals to Israeli authorities to enter the area to investigate. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said in a post on X that the first responders “were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives. Amnesty International’s Mohamed Duar, spokesperson for the occupied Palestinian territory, said: “Despite their protected status under the Geneva Conventions and International Humanitarian Law, Israeli Forces continue to target healthcare workers… Ambulances and hospitals continue to come under fire and be destroyed.”

“There is no respect for humanitarians,” Della Longa told Al Jazeera."

The 13th edition of RightsCon is less than a month away (February 24-27, Taipei and online) and we would like to share an update to our core policies, principles, and processes that help keep our summit a safe, productive, and inclusive space for the community. Our aim
Over the past 14 years, RightsCon has grown from a gathering of 400 participants in Silicon Valley to a global community of more than 10,000 human rights defenders. While no security measure is infallible, we recognize our role in equipping the RightsCon community with the tools, policies, and information needed to help ensure a safe and productive experience of the summit. Our approach and policies
RightsCon safety policies and processes are developed by our internal Safety Working Group (SWG), with leads from Access Now’s Code of Conduct, Security, and RightsCon teams. This year, we’ve expanded the SWG to include an advisory committee of internal stakeholders and directly engaged community members with the goal of creating a deeper, cross-functional, and holistic approach to assessing and supporting the community. For more information on our safety and security planning, as well as our accessibility approach for RightsCon 2025, please visit the Participate page on our website. Increased media management: In recognition of the need to balance increased interest from media with participant privacy, we’re implementing a new approach to media management to ensure participants’ privacy, and provide structured guidelines for media coverage. While we have work to do for future iterations of RightsCon, this year we are committed to the following measures:

Masks will be provided at registration and participants are strongly encouraged to wear them. The RightsCon team and Safety Working Group members will wear masks in the venue. Broadening the support we provide to our community: We recognize that the current geopolitical landscape presents significant challenges, and we understand that the discussions and topics at RightsCon can be both difficult and deeply personal for many in our community. We are also working to secure a team of psychosocial practitioners to provide one-on-one in-person support to participants at the venue during summit hours. If you’re joining us in-person in Taipei, save the following local emergency numbers:

Police: 110
Ambulance: 119
Nearest hospital: Taipei Medical University Hospital +886-2-2737-2181

Easy targets
The villagers of Zanuta are one of 46 Palestinian Bedouin communities in the occupied West Bank expelled from their land by state-backed Israeli settlers since October 7, 2023, according to Al-Haq, a Palestinian nonprofit. At the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, Israel called up thousands of reservists who were serving in the West Bank to fight in Gaza, and replaced them with “extremist settlers”, Parnes said. Area C is also under the complete control of the Israeli army, making it easier for settlers – supported by soldiers – to surround vulnerable Palestinian herder communities and expel them from their lands, say Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups. Advertisement 
This differs from Area A, which is technically under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, even though Israeli troops still raid it often, while Area B is under the joint control of the PA and the Israeli army. The Israeli government insists that Bedouin communities from “unrecognised” villages should simply relocate to cities, yet doing so would sever their connection with the land and threaten their way of life as herders.

In November 2024, Israeli police completed the demolition of Umm al-Hiran, even though the Bedouin inhabitants had agreed to live alongside Jewish settlers, as they told Al Jazeera in February 2024. Advertisement 
According to human rights groups, Israel’s Supreme Court has played a key role in legitimising policies that violate Palestinian rights, such as greenlighting the demolition of Palestinian homes and entire villages. Qamar Mashraki, a Palestinian lawyer representing Zanuta, as well as other Bedouin communities expelled from their lands since October 7, has won two cases so far. But Israeli settlers attacked families from Zanuta when they tried to return, preventing the community from rebuilding homes and herding their animals, pushing many to flee again in September 2024. With the help of Mashraki, Zanuta’s inhabitants filed a second court motion which demanded that Israeli authorities protect the community from Israeli settlers. “We’re under siege.”

This differs from Area A, which is technically under the full control of the Palestinian Authority, even though Israeli troops still raid it often, while Area B is under the joint control of the PA and the Israeli army. The Israeli government insists that Bedouin communities from “unrecognised” villages should simply relocate to cities, yet doing so would sever their connection with the land and threaten their way of life as herders.

In November 2024, Israeli police completed the demolition of Umm al-Hiran, even though the Bedouin inhabitants had agreed to live alongside Jewish settlers, as they told Al Jazeera in February 2024. Advertisement 
According to human rights groups, Israel’s Supreme Court has played a key role in legitimising policies that violate Palestinian rights, such as greenlighting the demolition of Palestinian homes and entire villages. Qamar Mashraki, a Palestinian lawyer representing Zanuta, as well as other Bedouin communities expelled from their lands since October 7, has won two cases so far. But Israeli settlers attacked families from Zanuta when they tried to return, preventing the community from rebuilding homes and herding their animals, pushing many to flee again in September 2024. With the help of Mashraki, Zanuta’s inhabitants filed a second court motion which demanded that Israeli authorities protect the community from Israeli settlers. “We’re under siege.”

“Children in Haiti are trapped in a vicious cycle – recruited into the very armed groups that are fueling their desperation, and the numbers are growing,” said UNICEF executive director and Inter-Agency Standing Committee principal advocate for Haiti, Catherine Russell. “This unacceptable trend must be reversed by ensuring children’s safety and welfare are prioritized by all parties.”
The report comes as violence in Haiti shows no sign of abating with poverty deepening and turmoil increasing amid political instability. “Even when they are armed with weapons, the child here is the victim.”
In a country where more than 60 percent of the population lives on less than $4 a day and hundreds of thousands of Haitians are starving or near starvation, recruiting children is often easy. One minor who was in a gang said he was paid $33 every Saturday, while another said he was paid thousands of dollars in his first month in a gang operation, according to a UN Security Council report. Recruitment is surging as many schools remain closed and children become increasingly vulnerable, with gang violence leaving more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years, including an estimated 365,000 minors.

“The issues that RightsCon addresses deserve leader-level attention … these are some of the most important issues that we could be talking about today.” (2022)
Jacinda Ardern
Former Prime Minister of New Zealand

















“This was my first RightsCon conference and what an experience it was, hosting a conversation about healing, hope and protest was just what I needed during a summer during which Black people were grappling with mass deaths through COVID and evidence that we are still continually hunted and killed by the police. […] I hope this will be the beginning of a long relationship with RightsCon as they think about how anti-racist policies and practices can become part of human rights frames.” (2020)
Mutale Nkonde
CEO AI for the People, Key Constituent of the UN 3C Round Table on AI

















“RightsCon is the Davos of Digital Rights.” (2017)
Matt Peacock
Group Director of Corporate Affairs at Vodafone Group

















“RightsCon is an online and offline space to build relationships on the digital rights’ agenda among actors and communities from diverse sectors and geographical locations. This is where you get to do the real work… It’s where you get to meet people who you can mentor, who want to do what you’re doing, where you can meet people who have done what you’re trying to do, who can mentor you, and it’s where you can meet your peers, so you know you’re not the only crazy person who wants to save the world.” (2018)
Gbénga Sèsan
Executive Director, Paradigm Initiative

















“Perhaps the most striking, joyous, part of it was being at a conference where diversity in all its forms was essential to its lifeblood – in contrast to most conferences I attend where diversity is too often thought of in terms of checking boxes.”
Bec Hamilton
Assistant Law Professor, American University

This is where you get to do the real work… It’s where you get to meet people who you can mentor, who want to do what you’re doing, where you can meet people who have done what you’re trying to do, who can mentor you, and it’s where you can meet your peers, so you know you’re not the only crazy person who wants to save the world.” (2018)
Gbénga Sèsan
Executive Director, Paradigm Initiative

















“Perhaps the most striking, joyous, part of it was being at a conference where diversity in all its forms was essential to its lifeblood – in contrast to most conferences I attend where diversity is too often thought of in terms of checking boxes.”
Bec Hamilton
Assistant Law Professor, American University

“The issues that RightsCon addresses deserve leader-level attention … these are some of the most important issues that we could be talking about today.” (2022)
Jacinda Ardern
Former Prime Minister of New Zealand

















“This was my first RightsCon conference and what an experience it was, hosting a conversation about healing, hope and protest was just what I needed during a summer during which Black people were grappling with mass deaths through COVID and evidence that we are still continually hunted and killed by the police. […] I hope this will be the beginning of a long relationship with RightsCon as they think about how anti-racist policies and practices can become part of human rights frames.” (2020)

What did Al Jazeera’s investigation into Israeli war crimes in Gaza reveal? | Israel-Palestine conflict News | Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/3/what-did-al-jazeeras-investigation-into-israeli-war-crimes-in-gaza-reveal,news_outlet,0.3166666666666667,,"play videoplay videoVideo Duration 01 hours 20 minutes 59 seconds play-arrow01:20:59Gaza_Film_Long_Version_FinalBy Richard Sanders and Al Jazeera Investigative UnitPublished On 3 Oct 20243 Oct 2024When they entered Gaza on October 27, after three weeks of aerial bombardment following Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, Israeli troops took their iPhones with them. “We live in an era of technology, and this has been described as the first livestreamed genocide in history,” Palestinian novelist Susan Abulhawa told Al Jazeera’s investigative unit (I-Unit).Recommended Stories list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4October 7: Forensic analysis shows Hamas abuses, many false Israeli claimslist 2 of 4Risk of long-feared regional war rises as Israel and Iran swap threatslist 3 of 4Israel destroyed my university, but not my desire for an educationlist 4 of 4Is the Middle East inching closer to full-blown war?end of list
In the year since, Israeli soldiers have posted thousands of videos and photos on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. These videos and photos form the foundation of the I-Unit’s new film, which investigates Israeli war crimes primarily through the medium of the evidence Israeli soldiers themselves have provided. As journalists in the West sought to portray the war on Gaza as complex and nuanced, a flood of social media posts from Israeli soldiers suggested they regarded it as anything but. It expected to have to dedicate considerable resources to geolocation – the use of satellite maps and other sources to identify specific locations – and to the use of facial recognition software to scan the internet to identify the soldiers featured in the photos and videos. It showed the footage to a range of military and human rights experts, including Dixon, Charlie Herbert, a retired major-general in the British Army, and Bill Van Esveld, the associate director for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch. It also employed teams on the ground to film the testimony of witnesses and made use of Israeli drone footage collected by Al Jazeera Arabic. It will be for prosecutors to decide the guilt or otherwise of the soldiers, but both Dixon and Van Esveld told Al Jazeera that several of the incidents documented merited investigation by international investigators. Most of the photos and videos fell into one of three categories: wanton destruction, the mistreatment of detainees and the use of human shields. Israeli soldiers have posted many videos on social media showing them destroying buildings in Gaza [Al Jazeera]
Mistreatment of detainees
Some of the videos show large numbers of detainees stripped to their underwear, being held in stress positions and mocked for having soiled themselves. He was tortured.”
“Torture is one of the most serious international crimes … Very often, though, it’s difficult to get evidence … This kind of material where you have persons on camera admitting that they have participated in torture would be very useful to any investigator or a prosecutor,” Dixon told Al Jazeera. Article 8 (2)(a)(ii) of the Rome Statute prohibits “torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments”; while Article 8 (2)(b)(xxi) prohibits “committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment”. #GazaCrimespic.twitter.com/LmKn7fVnZH

Human shields
The I-Unit interviewed six individuals who testified to being used as human shields by Israeli troops. Abu Amer described how during clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters, the Israeli soldiers “took us, the men, and placed us near the balcony. A photo taken by an Israeli soldier in Gaza City in November – and posted online – shows two detainees walking in front of a tank with a soldier behind them. It destroyed hundreds of buildings in Gaza City and then progressed to the south of the Strip where, between December 28 and June 9, it entirely destroyed Khirbet Khuza’a, a town of 13,000 people close to the fence separating Gaza from Israel. “The International Criminal Court will … look for those who are high up the chain of command … and evidence coming directly from commanders about the orders that they gave and the way in which they command and control the troops would be vital evidence,” said Dixon. #GazaCrimes pic.twitter.com/Xhh3bnbSPK

“When you start acting in a conflict to a level that the people on the ground who are doing the fighting are using your information as they fight,” you may become “a party to the conflict”, Van Esveld explained. It told us: “The UK is not a participant in the conflict between Israel and Hamas … As a matter of principle, we only provide intelligence to our allies where we are satisfied that it will be used in accordance with International Humanitarian Law … Only information related to hostage rescue is passed to the Israeli authorities.”
It added: “Our priority remains achieving a ceasefire in Gaza so hostages can be released, civilians protected and aid flood in.”

In the year since, Israeli soldiers have posted thousands of videos and photos on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. These videos and photos form the foundation of the I-Unit’s new film, which investigates Israeli war crimes primarily through the medium of the evidence Israeli soldiers themselves have provided. As journalists in the West sought to portray the war on Gaza as complex and nuanced, a flood of social media posts from Israeli soldiers suggested they regarded it as anything but. It expected to have to dedicate considerable resources to geolocation – the use of satellite maps and other sources to identify specific locations – and to the use of facial recognition software to scan the internet to identify the soldiers featured in the photos and videos. It showed the footage to a range of military and human rights experts, including Dixon, Charlie Herbert, a retired major-general in the British Army, and Bill Van Esveld, the associate director for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch. It also employed teams on the ground to film the testimony of witnesses and made use of Israeli drone footage collected by Al Jazeera Arabic. It will be for prosecutors to decide the guilt or otherwise of the soldiers, but both Dixon and Van Esveld told Al Jazeera that several of the incidents documented merited investigation by international investigators. Most of the photos and videos fell into one of three categories: wanton destruction, the mistreatment of detainees and the use of human shields.

Mistreatment of detainees

“Torture is one of the most serious international crimes … Very often, though, it’s difficult to get evidence … This kind of material where you have persons on camera admitting that they have participated in torture would be very useful to any investigator or a prosecutor,” Dixon told Al Jazeera.

Human shields
The I-Unit interviewed six individuals who testified to being used as human shields by Israeli troops. Abu Amer described how during clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters, the Israeli soldiers “took us, the men, and placed us near the balcony. A photo taken by an Israeli soldier in Gaza City in November – and posted online – shows two detainees walking in front of a tank with a soldier behind them. It destroyed hundreds of buildings in Gaza City and then progressed to the south of the Strip where, between December 28 and June 9, it entirely destroyed Khirbet Khuza’a, a town of 13,000 people close to the fence separating Gaza from Israel. “The International Criminal Court will … look for those who are high up the chain of command … and evidence coming directly from commanders about the orders that they gave and the way in which they command and control the troops would be vital evidence,” said Dixon. #GazaCrimes pic.twitter.com/Xhh3bnbSPK

“When you start acting in a conflict to a level that the people on the ground who are doing the fighting are using your information as they fight,” you may become “a party to the conflict”, Van Esveld explained. It told us: “The UK is not a participant in the conflict between Israel and Hamas … As a matter of principle, we only provide intelligence to our allies where we are satisfied that it will be used in accordance with International Humanitarian Law … Only information related to hostage rescue is passed to the Israeli authorities.”

Instead of talking to my classmates, I received the news that one of them, my dear friend Alaa, had been killed by an Israeli air strike. Advertisement 
On October 14, I bid farewell to my home in Gaza City as my parents, siblings and I fled to Khan Younis, thinking we would be safe there. In Khan Younis, I dreamed of going back to university. In December, I received news that another classmate, Fatima, was killed by the Israeli army along with her father and siblings. In January, the Israeli army intensified bombardment, massacring hundreds in Khan Younis, and then raided Al-Khair Hospital near us. Advertisement 
When Birzeit University (BZU) contacted me, I felt like fortune finally smiled on me. Just five days after the semester started on May 7, my family and I again had to flee the advancing Israeli army. The Israeli army’s assault on Khan Younis had left it looking like a ghost town. In June, I received news that my original university, IUG, had come up with a plan to allow students to complete their studies remotely through a combination of self-study and instruction. It divided the semester we started last October in two, giving us a month to study material that would normally take months before taking exams for the first part; then we had to do the same for the second part. I registered for two courses, and every day started walking the seven kilometres to al-Mawasi under the scorching sun, passing heaps of rubble, garbage and puddles of sewage water, to download lectures and stay in touch with my university. Shortly after I started studying, the Israeli army carried out a massive attack on al-Mawasi, dropping eight enormous bombs on the camp, killing at least 90 people and injuring 300 others. Every two days, I had to send it in the morning to a charging service and wait till the afternoon to get it back, wasting a whole day. Then I started studying for the second part of the semester and the other three exams, which I took in September. I finished this improvised semester almost a year after the start of the war – a year of displacement, loss, tent life, nightmares and incessant explosions. These two months of studying for the exams were a small distraction from the overwhelming feelings of loss and despair amid this ongoing genocide. aj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content  Advertisement

Shortly after I started studying, the Israeli army carried out a massive attack on al-Mawasi, dropping eight enormous bombs on the camp, killing at least 90 people and injuring 300 others. Every two days, I had to send it in the morning to a charging service and wait till the afternoon to get it back, wasting a whole day. Then I started studying for the second part of the semester and the other three exams, which I took in September. I finished this improvised semester almost a year after the start of the war – a year of displacement, loss, tent life, nightmares and incessant explosions. These two months of studying for the exams were a small distraction from the overwhelming feelings of loss and despair amid this ongoing genocide. aj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content  Advertisement

Instead of talking to my classmates, I received the news that one of them, my dear friend Alaa, had been killed by an Israeli air strike. Advertisement 
On October 14, I bid farewell to my home in Gaza City as my parents, siblings and I fled to Khan Younis, thinking we would be safe there. In Khan Younis, I dreamed of going back to university. In December, I received news that another classmate, Fatima, was killed by the Israeli army along with her father and siblings. In January, the Israeli army intensified bombardment, massacring hundreds in Khan Younis, and then raided Al-Khair Hospital near us. Advertisement 
When Birzeit University (BZU) contacted me, I felt like fortune finally smiled on me. Just five days after the semester started on May 7, my family and I again had to flee the advancing Israeli army. The Israeli army’s assault on Khan Younis had left it looking like a ghost town. In June, I received news that my original university, IUG, had come up with a plan to allow students to complete their studies remotely through a combination of self-study and instruction.

In a war of tariffs on goods, Brussels has less room to manoeuvre than Washington, given EU goods imports from the US totalled 334 billion euros ($366.2bn) in 2024, against 532 billion euros ($582.1bn) of EU exports to the US."

Nine Palestine Red Crescent (PRCS) medics in ambulances, as well as some Civil Defence workers, went to help people in Rafah, Gaza, and disappeared on March 23 after coming under attack from Israeli forces. Here’s everything we know about how Israel killed these first responders in Gaza:

Israeli forces killed them. “In the early hours of Sunday, 23 March, our Palestine Red Crescent colleagues were entering the area of al-Hashaashin, Rafah to save lives and came under fire,” Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), told Al Jazeera.

The bodies of 14 murdered people were found in a shallow mass grave, according to the PRCS. “The available information indicates that the first team was killed by Israeli forces on 23 March, and that other emergency and aid crews were struck one after another over several hours as they searched for their missing colleagues,” a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Palestine said. There’s a UN vehicle here, …[an] Israeli forces bulldozer has buried them.”

The Israeli army’s international spokesperson, Nadav Shoshani, said the medics had not been killed deliberately. Referring to Israeli soldiers firing at clearly marked ambulances and UN vehicles, Shoshani wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”, not clarifying what was meant by “uncoordinated vehicle”.

Shoshani also claimed without evidence that “terrorists” were hidden amid the rescue workers and that “[Israeli] forces eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who took part in the October 7 massacre, along with eight other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.”

Della Longa said that, for a whole week, the IFRC, PRCS, ICRC and the UN made appeals to Israeli authorities to enter the area to investigate. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said in a post on X that the first responders “were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives.

What We Fund
How We Fund


We provide flexible and grantee-driven funding to grassroots and frontline organizations fighting for human rights in the digital age. We Prioritize

Grassroots organizations rooted in at-risk communities with limited access to funding


Frontline organizations working in contexts where the impacts of digital rights violations are most severe


Organizations working at the intersection of digital rights and other human rights issues


Feminist organizations working to protect the digital rights of women, LGBTQ+ people, and gender nonconforming people

See full list of grantees




WHAT WE FUND
Threats to digital rights take many forms, depending on the context and unique challenges specific users or communities face, ranging from censorship and network disruption, to communications surveillance, to lack of protections for personal data, to online harassment, and beyond. Some examples of what Access Now Grants supports include:


Research, monitoring, advocacy, and public campaigns to fight internet shutdowns


Digital security accompaniment for users at risk, such as women, LGBTQ+ people, human rights defenders, and minority communities


Efforts to combat online violence through direct interventions with at-risk users and tech companies


Documentation and advocacy to fight impunity for digital attacks on human rights defenders, journalists, activists, and other at-risk groups


Protection of digital civic space during elections and conflict, and in the face of content takedowns, surveillance, troll armies, etc. Projects to integrate digital rights into broader human rights movements to ensure they are effective and protected in the digital space


Strategies for advancing individual control of our digital identities that center the experiences of those most detrimentally impacted by violations of privacy rights


And more! HOW WE FUND
Our grantmaking is grounded in international human rights frameworks and takes an intersectional approach that recognizes that threats to digital rights are compounded when they intersect with other human rights abuses or discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, class, or other means of marginalization. TRANSPARENCY
Be transparent about criteria, internal processes, and decisions


ACCOUNTABILITY
Ensure respect for and accountability to our grantees through our processes and communications, while acknowledging and working to flatten the power imbalances between funder and grantee
