Introduction






UN Peacekeeping helps countries to achieve lasting peace, supports political processes, protects hundreds of thousands of civilians and helps guarantee cease fires. To respond to these challenges, the Secretary-General launched Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) to refocus peacekeeping with more targeted mandates, make our operations stronger and safer, mobilize support for political solutions and better equipped and trained forces. Action by the Secretariat alone is not enough to meet the challenges we face.”

AntÃ³nio Guterres
United Nations Secretary-General













Thematic Areas of Improvement






Commitments






Endorsements by Member States






Expressions of Support (by regional organisations)





Eight areas of Improvement
The A4P initiative aims to strengthen peacekeeping by spurring collective action by all peacekeeping stakeholders, including all Member States, the Security Council, the General Assembly, financial contributors, troop and police contributing countries, host countries, intergovernmental and regional organizations and the UN Secretariat. Conduct of peacekeepers and peacekeeping operations
Strengthen conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel








The Road to Implementation

All peacekeeping stakeholders have a responsibility to strengthen peacekeeping. In August 2019, the UN Department of Peace Operations carried out a survey to gather perceptions of progress in A4P implementation, and register concrete actions being taken by UN Peacekeeping stakeholders to implement the 45 commitments in the A4P Declaration. Politics



Advance political solutions to conflict and enhance the political impact of peacekeeping

We collectively commit to stronger engagement to advance political solutions to conflict and to pursue complementary political objectives and integrated strategies, including at national and regional levels, within our respective mandates and responsibilities. Women, peace and security



Implement the women, peace and security agenda 

We collectively commit to implement the Women, Peace and Security agenda and its priorities by ensuring full, equal and meaningful participation of women in all stages of the peace process and by systematically integrating a gender perspective into all stages of analysis, planning, implementation and reporting. Protection



Strengthen the protection provided by peacekeeping operations

We collectively commit to support tailored, context-specific peacekeeping approaches to protecting civilians, in relevant peacekeeping operations, emphasising the protection of women and children in those contexts. Safety and security

Performance and accountability



Support effective performance and accountability by all peacekeeping components

We collectively commit to ensuring the highest level of peacekeeping performance, and to hold all civilian and uniformed peacekeepers, particularly leadership, accountable for effective performance under common parameters while addressing performance shortfalls. The Secretary-General commits to develop an integrated performance policy framework based on clear standards for all actors, and to ensure that performance data is used to inform planning, evaluation, deployment decisions and reporting; to communicate to Member States all operational and technical requirements; to provide effective field support to peacekeeping operations, and to work with Member States to generate the necessary specialized capabilities, including language skills, while supporting new approaches to improve force generation, equipment serviceability and sustainability.

Recognising the Security Councilâs primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, we reaffirm the need to enhance the predictability, sustainability and flexibility of financing for AU-led peace support operations authorized by the Security Council, and under the Security Councilâs authority consistent with Chapter VIII of the UN Charter. Conduct of peacekeepers and peacekeeping operations



Strengthen conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel

We collectively commit, within our respective responsibilities, to holding personnel and leadership accountable for proper conduct, including through support to the UN zero-tolerance policy with its victim-centred approach on all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. We commit as Member States to certifying that prospective personnel meet UN standards for service in UN peacekeeping operations. “We as endorsers of this Declaration commit to translating these commitments into our positions and practices in the relevant UN bodies, including the General Assembly and the Security Council in their consideration of peacekeeping, and to meet periodically in relevant formats to review progress, including at field-level.”
The following organisations support the A4P Declaration: European Union (EU), Organisation internationale de la francophonie (OIF), African Union Commission (AU), and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). To strengthen consultation between peacekeeping stakeholders on mandates and their implementation, we collectively commit to implement existing intergovernmental commitments on triangular cooperation between uniformed personnel contributing countries, the Security Council and Secretariat (Para 7)

9. We collectively commit to implement the Women, Peace and Security agenda and its priorities by ensuring full, equal and meaningful participation of women in all stages of the peace process (Para 8)

Reduce inequality within and among countries - United Nations Sustainable Development,https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/,UN_organization,0.33333333333333337,,"Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries









Reduce inequality within and among countriesMartin2023-10-20T15:05:52-04:00





Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction and destroys people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth. Reducing both within- and between-country inequality requires equitable resource distribution, investing in education and skills development, implementing social protection measures, combating discrimination, supporting marginalized groups and fostering international cooperation for fair trade and financial systems. Among countries, we need to ensure that developing countries are better represented in decision-making on global issues so that solutions can be more effective, credible and accountable. Governments and other stakeholders can also promote safe, regular and responsible migration, including through planned and well-managed policies, for the millions of people who have left their homes seeking better lives due to war, discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunity and other drivers of migration. Reducing both within- and between-country inequality requires equitable resource distribution, investing in education and skills development, implementing social protection measures, combating discrimination, supporting marginalized groups and fostering international cooperation for fair trade and financial systems.

Inequality threatens long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction and destroys people’s sense of fulfillment and self-worth. Reducing both within- and between-country inequality requires equitable resource distribution, investing in education and skills development, implementing social protection measures, combating discrimination, supporting marginalized groups and fostering international cooperation for fair trade and financial systems. Among countries, we need to ensure that developing countries are better represented in decision-making on global issues so that solutions can be more effective, credible and accountable. Governments and other stakeholders can also promote safe, regular and responsible migration, including through planned and well-managed policies, for the millions of people who have left their homes seeking better lives due to war, discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunity and other drivers of migration.

Facts and figures

The incomes of the poorest 40 per cent of the population had been growing faster than the national average in most countries. Reducing both within- and between-country inequality requires equitable resource distribution, investing in education and skills development, implementing social protection measures, combating discrimination, supporting marginalized groups and fostering international cooperation for fair trade and financial systems.

Goal 8 is about promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. Global real GDP per capita growth is forecast to slow down in 2023 and with ever increasing challenging economic conditions, more workers are turning to informal employment. However, more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, especially for young people, reduce informal employment and labour market inequality (particularly in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and secure working environments, and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth. Providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as leveling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socio-economic background. Governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting youth employment and women’s economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all. World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2023 Key messages 
Average global inflation is projected to decline from 7.5 per cent in 2022 to 5.2 per cent in 2023 amid lower food and energy prices and softening demand especially in the large developed economies. World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2023 Key messages

Goal 8 targets
8.1 Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries
8.2 Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors
8.3 Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services
8.4 Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead
8.5 By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value
8.6 By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training
8.7 Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms
8.8 Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment
8.9 By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products
8.10 Strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all
8.A Increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries
8.B By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization

Goal 8 is about promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. However, more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, especially for young people, reduce informal employment and labour market inequality (particularly in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and secure working environments, and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth. Providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as leveling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socio-economic background. Governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting youth employment and women’s economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all.

Progress towards quality education was already slower than required before the pandemic, but COVID-19 has had devastating impacts on education, causing learning losses in four out of five of the 104 countries studied. In addition to free primary and secondary schooling for all boys and girls by 2030, the aim is to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, eliminate gender and wealth disparities, and achieve universal access to quality higher education. While progress has been made towards the 2030 education targets set by the United Nations, continued efforts are required to address persistent challenges and ensure that quality education is accessible to all, leaving no one behind. According to national education targets, the percentage of students attaining basic reading skills by the end of primary school is projected to rise from 51 per cent in 2015 to 67 per cent by 2030.

Progress towards quality education was already slower than required before the pandemic, but COVID-19 has had devastating impacts on education, causing learning losses in four out of five of the 104 countries studied. In addition to free primary and secondary schooling for all boys and girls by 2030, the aim is to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, eliminate gender and wealth disparities, and achieve universal access to quality higher education. While progress has been made towards the 2030 education targets set by the United Nations, continued efforts are required to address persistent challenges and ensure that quality education is accessible to all, leaving no one behind.

Progress towards quality education was already slower than required before the pandemic, but COVID-19 has had devastating impacts on education, causing learning losses in four out of five of the 104 countries studied. Without additional measures, only one in six countries will achieve the universal secondary school completion target by 2030, an estimated 84 million children and young people will still be out of school, and approximately 300 million students will lack the basic numeracy and literacy skills necessary for success in life.

Without additional measures, only one in six countries will achieve the universal secondary school completion target by 2030, an estimated 84 million children and young people will still be out of school, and approximately 300 million students will lack the basic numeracy and literacy skills necessary for success in life.

Action for Peacekeeping (A4P)




Action for Peacekeeping (A4P)








Through his Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative, the Secretary-General called on Member States, the Security Council, host countries, troop- and police- contributing countries, regional partners and financial contributors to renew our collective engagement with UN peacekeeping and mutually commit to reach for excellence. Declaration of Shared Commitments
The Secretary-General shared the Declaration of Shared Commitments on 16 August and invited Member States and relevant international and regional organisations to endorse it. Implementation goals are centred on eight priority commitment areas:
politics
women, peace and security
protection
safety and security
performance and accountability
peacebuilding and sustaining peace
partnerships
conduct of peacekeepers and peacekeeping operations
These eight priority commitment areas are anchored in ongoing areas of work, including the Gender Parity Strategy; the Women, Peace and Security Agenda; Santos Cruz Action Plan; Management Reform; Police Strategic Guidance Framework; Strategic Force Generation; the United Nations/African Union Joint Framework and Declaration; the Triangular Partnership Project; the Voluntary Compact on the commitment to eliminate sexual exploitation and abuse; the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy and the Environment Strategy. See A4P Highlights of Key Achievements
See A4P Key Achievements on Performance 
See A4P Implementation in HQ and Field Missions 
In August 2019, the UN Department of Peace Operations carried out a survey to gather perceptions of progress in A4P implementation, and register concrete actions taken by UN Peacekeeping stakeholders to implement the 45 commitments in the A4P Declaration. Thematic Consultations
Five thematic consultations took place in June, at which Member States and Regional Organizations put forward proposals for mutual commitments that could strengthen peacekeeping. Peacebuilding
Member States raised the need for coherence in relation to peacebuilding, among the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission as well as between the UN and external actors such as regional and sub-regional organizations, host countries, and international financial institutions. Performance
Member States emphasized that performance had to be discussed in relation to all mission components, and also in relation to all peacekeeping stakeholders, from personnel on the ground and Headquarters, to the Security Council and troop-contributing countries. Member States underscored the need for specific gender, women protection and child protection expertise in peacekeeping operations; gender-sensitive analysis and strategies to inform decision-making; and the implementation of the Women and Peace and Security agenda by peacekeeping operations and host governments. Partnerships
Member States had specified commitments at the strategic level to include enhanced cooperation between the Security Council and the AU Peace and Security Architecture. Politics
Several Members States called for a more strategic and coherent role for the Security Council; for the Council to make better use of the tools at its disposal for supporting political processes; and for Security Council members to support Security Council actions through their individual actions, including development, trade and military policies. Regarding the role of host governments, Member States recognized the primacy of this role, but also the need for host governments to commit to support peacekeeping operations with their consent and cooperation – while also including host nations in occasional closed consultations and more systematic work by the Council and the Secretariat with host states to address host state responsibility for mandate implementation. Member States called for further improvement in triangular consultations involving the Security Council, T/PCCs and the Secretariat, and for for the Secretariat to provide better early warning, improve coherence of political efforts, support the Secretary-General’s surge in mediation efforts, improve linkages across the pillars of the UN, and provide frank options, advice and analysis and honest assessments of country situations to the Security Council. Member States encouraged greater cooperation between the Security Council, Secretariat and regional and sub-regional organizations to ensure consistent and effective horizon scanning and early warning efforts.

In August 2019, the UN Department of Peace Operations carried out a survey to gather perceptions of progress in A4P implementation, and register concrete actions taken by UN Peacekeeping stakeholders to implement the 45 commitments in the A4P Declaration. Thematic Consultations
Five thematic consultations took place in June, at which Member States and Regional Organizations put forward proposals for mutual commitments that could strengthen peacekeeping. Peacebuilding
Member States raised the need for coherence in relation to peacebuilding, among the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission as well as between the UN and external actors such as regional and sub-regional organizations, host countries, and international financial institutions. Performance
Member States emphasized that performance had to be discussed in relation to all mission components, and also in relation to all peacekeeping stakeholders, from personnel on the ground and Headquarters, to the Security Council and troop-contributing countries. Member States underscored the need for specific gender, women protection and child protection expertise in peacekeeping operations; gender-sensitive analysis and strategies to inform decision-making; and the implementation of the Women and Peace and Security agenda by peacekeeping operations and host governments. Partnerships
Member States had specified commitments at the strategic level to include enhanced cooperation between the Security Council and the AU Peace and Security Architecture. Politics
Several Members States called for a more strategic and coherent role for the Security Council; for the Council to make better use of the tools at its disposal for supporting political processes; and for Security Council members to support Security Council actions through their individual actions, including development, trade and military policies. Regarding the role of host governments, Member States recognized the primacy of this role, but also the need for host governments to commit to support peacekeeping operations with their consent and cooperation – while also including host nations in occasional closed consultations and more systematic work by the Council and the Secretariat with host states to address host state responsibility for mandate implementation. Member States called for further improvement in triangular consultations involving the Security Council, T/PCCs and the Secretariat, and for for the Secretariat to provide better early warning, improve coherence of political efforts, support the Secretary-General’s surge in mediation efforts, improve linkages across the pillars of the UN, and provide frank options, advice and analysis and honest assessments of country situations to the Security Council. Member States encouraged greater cooperation between the Security Council, Secretariat and regional and sub-regional organizations to ensure consistent and effective horizon scanning and early warning efforts. Implementation goals are centred on eight priority commitment areas:

These eight priority commitment areas are anchored in ongoing areas of work, including the Gender Parity Strategy; the Women, Peace and Security Agenda; Santos Cruz Action Plan; Management Reform; Police Strategic Guidance Framework; Strategic Force Generation; the United Nations/African Union Joint Framework and Declaration; the Triangular Partnership Project; the Voluntary Compact on the commitment to eliminate sexual exploitation and abuse; the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy and the Environment Strategy.
