 By Kate Forbes, President of the IFRCOn Sunday, I received news that left me heartbroken and enraged: eight members from the Palestine Red Crescent Society were killed in Gaza. They should have been protected.Their deaths are unbearable loss, not only for the Palestine Red Crescent Society but for the entire Red Cross and Red Crescent family. Because behind them lies a truth: even in the most dangerous and dehumanizing conditions, there are people who continue to help others—knowing well that every day may be their last.The fact that you know you might die, but you still choose to help others—that is the purest reflection of what it means to be a humanitarian.Yesterday, we observed a moment of silence in IFRC Offices around the world. Every time a Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteer or staff is targeted, every time an ambulance is struck, every time a life is lost while saving another—it tears at the very fabric of humanity.One of our Fundamental Principles - the principle of neutrality - means dealing with consequences, not assigning blame. Accountability is important for the families and loved ones of all eight members who were killed, for the one who is still missing, for the entire Red Cross and Red Crescent family, and for the whole humanitarian community.

 By Kate Forbes, President of the IFRCOn Sunday, I received news that left me heartbroken and enraged: eight members from the Palestine Red Crescent Society were killed in Gaza. They should have been protected.Their deaths are unbearable loss, not only for the Palestine Red Crescent Society but for the entire Red Cross and Red Crescent family. Because behind them lies a truth: even in the most dangerous and dehumanizing conditions, there are people who continue to help others—knowing well that every day may be their last.The fact that you know you might die, but you still choose to help others—that is the purest reflection of what it means to be a humanitarian.Yesterday, we observed a moment of silence in IFRC Offices around the world. Every time a Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteer or staff is targeted, every time an ambulance is struck, every time a life is lost while saving another—it tears at the very fabric of humanity.One of our Fundamental Principles - the principle of neutrality - means dealing with consequences, not assigning blame. Accountability is important for the families and loved ones of all eight members who were killed, for the one who is still missing, for the entire Red Cross and Red Crescent family, and for the whole humanitarian community.

World Water Day 2025: Glacier Preservation and Health

22 – 21 March 2025












World Water Day, observed annually on 22 March since 1993, underscores the essential role of freshwater in our lives and calls for collective action to tackle the global water crisis. Tackling water insecurity is a cornerstone of ensuring the health and survival of women, children, and adolescents worldwide.On World Water Day 2025, PMNCH emphasizes the critical link between water and health:Improving maternal and newborn health: Safe water is essential during childbirth to prevent infections and ensure hygienic conditions for mothers and babies.Reducing childhood illnesses: Access to clean water and sanitation reduces diarrheal diseases, which are a leading cause of child mortality globally.Empowering adolescent health: Clean water ensures access to proper hygiene and menstrual health management, enabling adolescent girls to thrive and remain in school.World Water Day also calls for bold action to:Protect water resources by prioritizing climate resilience and glacier preservation.Ensure water access for marginalized communities, including women and children in low-resource settings.Integrate water and sanitation into global health strategies, recognizing its role in reducing inequality and improving health outcomes.Let’s take this opportunity to amplify the message that water is health, water is equity, and water is life. Share stories, mobilize communities, and use the hashtag #WorldWaterDay to inspire global dialogue and action.Together, we can safeguard glaciers, secure water for all, and strengthen health systems to ensure a brighter future for every woman, child, and adolescent.UNWATER campaign assets for advocacy: ACTIVATION KIT in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.CAMPAIGN TRELLO with social media resources in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.CERTIFICATE.FACTSHEET in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.

IFRC condemns the killing of eight Palestine Red Crescent medics in Gaza 
Geneva, 30 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is outraged at the deaths of eight medics from Palestine Red Crescent Society, killed on duty in Gaza.An emergency medical team of nine disappeared along with their ambulances when they came under heavy fire in Al-Hashashin on 23 March. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. All parties must stop the killing, and all humanitarians must be protected.’”This devastating incident represents the single most deadly attack on Red Cross Red Crescent workers anywhere in the world since 2017.Chapagain added: “The number of Palestine Red Crescent volunteers and staff killed since the start of this conflict is now 30. We stand with Palestine Red Crescent and the loved ones of those killed on this darkest of days.”For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67

Geneva, 29 March 2025: The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is standing with the Palestine Red Crescent and calling for urgent access and information following seven days of silence on the fate of nine medics in Gaza.The IFRC is gravely concerned for the ambulance crews of the Palestine Red Crescentwho came under heavy gunfire while responding in the early hours of 23 March in the Al-Hashashin area of Rafah. Since then, there has been no communication with the teams.International Humanitarian Law is clear that humanitarian and healthcare workers must be protected and respected.It is vital that there is information and access to ensure the safe return of these humanitarians to their families who are living in a nightmare without knowing if their loved ones are alive.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 744 68 In London:Nichola Jones: +44 771 545 99 56 In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 708 43 67

Speaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  
Most people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

IFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

Speaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  
Most people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. This is a step backward withdevastating humanitarian consequences, exposing civilians to a lasting risk of death and injury.International humanitarian law, including this convention, exists to protect people in the darkest times, based on the experience from war’s battlefields and their human costs. Over 80% of the world’s states are committed to a mine-free world, and this is the vision we must and will continue to work towards.For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Budapest:Corrie Butler, +36 70 430 6506

IFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line.

IFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma.

Speaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  
Most people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.

IFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society.

Speaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  
Most people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.

If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Speaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  
Most people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff.

And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

IFRC on three Palestine Red Crescent members killed: 'Unacceptable'. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

Speaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  
Most people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Speaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  
Most people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat.

We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed.

IFRC Secretary General in new op-ed: ‘Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave. Alongside fellow Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance officer Asaad Al-Nasasra – who is still missing – and medical and humanitarian workers from other organisations, they were in emergency vehicles, rushing in to do what they do.Post-ceasefire Gaza is dangerous, of course. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line.

The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line.

Speaking up for people caught in crisis:  Unpacking ‘humanitarian diplomacy’ with IFRC’s Dylan Winder  
Most people have some idea of what is meant by diplomacy. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. But what is ‘humanitarian diplomacy?’ Dylan Winder, permanent observer to the United Nations and director of global humanitarian diplomacy at the IFRC, says it’s about speaking up and finding solutions for people caught in crisis, who find themselves in vulnerable situations but don’t have a voice in the halls of power. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. And they know what it's like to lose colleagues who are killed as they try to help others.Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance driver Jihad Mansour is reminded of that loss every time he opens the door of his locker at his local branch office. Alburai was a volunteer ambulance crew member for the Palestine Red Crescent before he and his family moved to Slovenia due to insecurity in Gaza.“Sometimes as a volunteer, you go out to do your job and you don't know if you will meet your family again or not, you don't know if you will get back home or not,”he recalls. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers.

Statement by the IFRC at the Follow-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for the Civilian Population of Gaza
Excellencies,

The human suffering in Gaza is a permanent stain on our shared humanity. On the ground, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the Egyptian Red Crescent across the border work tirelessly to save lives and provide medical aid, food, and relief. The Egyptian Red Crescent has delivered nearly 3000 trucks of medical, food and relief supplies into Gaza while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society continues to provide emergency health services and coordinate the receipt and delivery of aid.

Excellencies,

No words adequately capture the depth of human suffering in Gaza. The Palestine Red Crescent Society is working around the clock with all affected communities in Gaza to provide vital humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support. In these difficult situations, the role of the local actors like the Red Cross and Red Crescent becomes central as they have the trust of the communities and of the authorities.

Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. Addressing inequalities that affect health outcomes, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender, is fundamental to ensuring all women have access to respectful and high-quality maternity care. SDG targets for maternal health include 3.1, aiming for an average global ratio of less than 70 deaths per 100 000 births by 2030, and 3.8, calling for the achievement of universal health coverage.

Improving maternal health is one of WHO’s key priorities, grounded in a human rights approach and linked to efforts on universal health coverage. WHO generates data, research, clinical guidelines and programmatic tools to support achievement of global targets and evidence-based strategies for ending preventable maternal mortality (EPMM) and improving maternal health and well-being.

Overview
                    




Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. Addressing inequalities that affect health outcomes, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender, is fundamental to ensuring all women have access to respectful and high-quality maternity care. SDG targets for maternal health include 3.1, aiming for an average global ratio of less than 70 deaths per 100 000 births by 2030, and 3.8, calling for the achievement of universal health coverage. WHO Response
                    




Improving maternal health is one of WHO’s key priorities, grounded in a human rights approach and linked to efforts on universal health coverage. WHO generates data, research, clinical guidelines and programmatic tools to support achievement of global targets and evidence-based strategies for ending preventable maternal mortality (EPMM) and improving maternal health and well-being.

            In the mountainous region of Talas, northern Kyrgyzstan, Red Crescent volunteers are leading the way to detect disease outbreaks early and keep their communities healthy and safe. In a bid to keep people in Talas safe and healthy, the Red Crescent Society of Kyrgyzstan (RCSK) is working hard to educate communities about different animal and human disease risks and introduce community-based surveillance (CBS) to detect and report potential outbreaks early to enable a rapid response. Kyrgyz Red Crescent volunteers take part in a 3-day community-based surveillance training in May 2024 to learn how to recognize signs of different diseases and quickly report them to local health and veterinary authorities. “We have a memorandum with the State health and veterinary authorities that helps us implement community-based surveillance (CBS),” explains Gulnura Abdumanapova, Health Coordinator with Kyrgyzstan Red Crescent  “We’ve trained 62 Red Crescent volunteers to recognize signs of the five most widely spread diseases in the area. Since community-based surveillance was introduced in Talas in June 2024, seven alerts from trained Red Crescent volunteers have so far been escalated to health authorities for investigation, resulting in the confirmation and quick response to five cases of acute respiratory infections, one case of Hepatitis A and one unusual animal death. Volunteers from the community, protecting the community Kyrgyzstan Red Crescent volunteers are well-placed to conduct community-based surveillance in Talas because they come from the communities they serve—meaning they understand the local health context and challenges, are always present, and are trusted by their neighbours and peers.

Protecting communities from epidemics in Kyrgyzstan’s rural north

The mountainous region of Talas in northern Kyrgyzstan is at a high risk of infectious disease outbreaks due to people living in close proximity to animals, and due to healthcare access challenges. In a bid to keep people in Talas safe and healthy, the Red Crescent Society of Kyrgyzstan (RCSK) is working hard to educate communities about different animal and human disease risks and introduce community-based surveillance (CBS) to detect and report potential outbreaks early to enable a rapid response. “We have a memorandum with the State health and veterinary authorities that helps us implement community-based surveillance (CBS),” explains Gulnura Abdumanapova, Health Coordinator with Kyrgyzstan Red Crescent  “We’ve trained 62 Red Crescent volunteers to recognize signs of the five most widely spread diseases in the area. Since community-based surveillance was introduced in Talas in June 2024, seven alerts from trained Red Crescent volunteers have so far been escalated to health authorities for investigation, resulting in the confirmation and quick response to five cases of acute respiratory infections, one case of Hepatitis A and one unusual animal death. Volunteers from the community, protecting the community Kyrgyzstan Red Crescent volunteers are well-placed to conduct community-based surveillance in Talas because they come from the communities they serve—meaning they understand the local health context and challenges, are always present, and are trusted by their neighbours and peers.

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 



 05/12/2024

       | Press release





In the lead up to International Volunteers Day, IFRC staff and Geneva Red Cross volunteers gathered in a moment of silence to pay tribute to IFRC network volunteers and staff who have died or been killed this year in the line of duty. Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person). IFRC Under Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy, Nena Stoiljkovic, and a Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.

Better maternal health means improving the rights of women and girlsBetter maternal health means improving the rights of women and girls so that they can plan their lives and protect their health. Show less Improve women and girls rights
Beyond survival, critical investment is needed to improve women’s longer-term health and well-beingWomen everywhere need access to health providers who listen to their concerns and meet their needs – including in the months after pregnancy when millions lack critical support, despite enduring lasting health consequences after birth. Show less Critical investment is needed
We can end preventable maternal and newborn deathsWHO is calling for a worldwide reinvigoration of efforts to ensure access to high quality care for women and babies, especially in the poorest countries, humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings where most maternal and newborn deaths occur. This includes compassionate care for those affected by stillbirth and miscarriage – requiring dedicated trainings for health workers and bereavement counselling for those in need.Postnatal support: Around a third of women suffer long-term health complications after childbirth, which can increase risks during future pregnancies, while up to 20% of new mothers have been estimated to experience postpartum depression or anxiety. An integrated approach to postnatal care connects physical health, mental health, and social support services in this critical period and beyond.Family-friendly policies: Family-friendly policies and laws are critical to ensure women have the right support to take care of their health and their babies, including paid maternity leave (at least 18 weeks, ideally 6 months or more), legal protections, and workplace support for breastfeeding.Empowering girls and woman: Girls’ access to education is associated with reduced likelihood of maternal death. Ensuring girls can stay in school and take decisions about their health and bodies is critical for improving their health.Show less Beyond survival
High-impact investmentsAntenatal checks: High quality antenatal services – including at least eight checks with a skilled health worker and early ultrasound – are essential for all women to support healthy pregnancies, reduce risks and detect possible complications. Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health is an investment in human capital, not a cost, leading to economic development and happier, healthier societies.No-one left behind: Given the high concentration of maternal and newborn deaths in humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings, ensuring impact and targeting interventions in these contexts will be critical for significantly reducing maternal and newborn deaths. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious. These are crucial even if you feel healthy, since not all conditions result in obvious symptoms.Staying healthy: Reduce risks by attending all antenatal appointments and maintaining a healthy lifestyle:avoid tobacco and substance abuse;stay physically active;get vaccinated as recommended;sleep on your side;manage existing health conditions with medical advice; andseek help if you have concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate care if you experience: vaginal bleeding; abdominal pain; blurred vision, sudden swelling, or persistent headache; changes in baby's movements; abdominal injuries. Take time to rest, ask for support if you need it, and reach out for medical help if you find you are feeling extremely overwhelmed, sad or anxious.Warning signs: Seek urgent care for your newborn baby if they have; a fever; a rash that comes on quickly and looks like bruises or bleeding under the skin or does not fade when you put a glass on it; seizures, are floppy or difficult to wake; difficulties breathing (they may be grunting or their tummy is sucking in when they breathe); signs of jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the skin); vomiting persistently or not keeping liquids down for several hours; diarrhoea, especially if it is bloody or accompanied by a fever, dehydration signs (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, sunken soft spot on the head).Trust your instincts: If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, speak to your health worker for advice.Here's some more information to know about newborn health.

This includes compassionate care for those affected by stillbirth and miscarriage – requiring dedicated trainings for health workers and bereavement counselling for those in need.Postnatal support: Around a third of women suffer long-term health complications after childbirth, which can increase risks during future pregnancies, while up to 20% of new mothers have been estimated to experience postpartum depression or anxiety. An integrated approach to postnatal care connects physical health, mental health, and social support services in this critical period and beyond.Family-friendly policies: Family-friendly policies and laws are critical to ensure women have the right support to take care of their health and their babies, including paid maternity leave (at least 18 weeks, ideally 6 months or more), legal protections, and workplace support for breastfeeding.Empowering girls and woman: Girls’ access to education is associated with reduced likelihood of maternal death. Ensuring girls can stay in school and take decisions about their health and bodies is critical for improving their health.Show less Beyond survival
High-impact investmentsAntenatal checks: High quality antenatal services – including at least eight checks with a skilled health worker and early ultrasound – are essential for all women to support healthy pregnancies, reduce risks and detect possible complications. Since small and sick babies require round-the-clock in-patient care, significant investment is needed in special newborn care units, quick referrals, and vital family support.Focus on midwives: Midwifery care models, where midwives provide ongoing support to pregnant women and babies after birth, have been shown to improve survival while reducing preterm births and unnecessary medical interventions. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health is an investment in human capital, not a cost, leading to economic development and happier, healthier societies.No-one left behind: Given the high concentration of maternal and newborn deaths in humanitarian emergencies and fragile settings, ensuring impact and targeting interventions in these contexts will be critical for significantly reducing maternal and newborn deaths. If these feelings become especially intense and/or persist beyond two weeks, seek advice.Bonding with your baby: Spend time skin-to-skin to promote bonding and regulate your baby's temperature and heart rate.Postnatal check-ups: Attend all postnatal appointments to monitor recovery and address concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate help if you experience: heavy bleeding or large clots; red or swollen legs; persistent headache; high fever or vomiting; non-healing wounds, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures.Mental health: Seek advice if you feel extremely sad or anxious. These are crucial even if you feel healthy, since not all conditions result in obvious symptoms.Staying healthy: Reduce risks by attending all antenatal appointments and maintaining a healthy lifestyle:avoid tobacco and substance abuse;stay physically active;get vaccinated as recommended;sleep on your side;manage existing health conditions with medical advice; andseek help if you have concerns.Warning signs: Seek immediate care if you experience: vaginal bleeding; abdominal pain; blurred vision, sudden swelling, or persistent headache; changes in baby's movements; abdominal injuries. Take time to rest, ask for support if you need it, and reach out for medical help if you find you are feeling extremely overwhelmed, sad or anxious.Warning signs: Seek urgent care for your newborn baby if they have; a fever; a rash that comes on quickly and looks like bruises or bleeding under the skin or does not fade when you put a glass on it; seizures, are floppy or difficult to wake; difficulties breathing (they may be grunting or their tummy is sucking in when they breathe); signs of jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the skin); vomiting persistently or not keeping liquids down for several hours; diarrhoea, especially if it is bloody or accompanied by a fever, dehydration signs (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, sunken soft spot on the head).Trust your instincts: If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, speak to your health worker for advice.Here's some more information to know about newborn health.

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

International Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons
In the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control. Don’t look away”.Event Details:What: Stand in Solidarity EventWhen: Monday, 19 August 2024, at 14:00Where: Main entrance of IFRC Headquarters, GenevaFor more information or to set up an interview contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 7084367 and Andrew Thomas: +41 76 3676587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

In the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control. Don’t look away”.Event Details:What: Stand in Solidarity EventWhen: Monday, 19 August 2024, at 14:00Where: Main entrance of IFRC Headquarters, GenevaFor more information or to set up an interview contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 7084367 and Andrew Thomas: +41 76 3676587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

In the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control. Don’t look away”.Event Details:What: Stand in Solidarity EventWhen: Monday, 19 August 2024, at 14:00Where: Main entrance of IFRC Headquarters, GenevaFor more information or to set up an interview contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 7084367 and Andrew Thomas: +41 76 3676587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

In the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control. Don’t look away”.Event Details:What: Stand in Solidarity EventWhen: Monday, 19 August 2024, at 14:00Where: Main entrance of IFRC Headquarters, GenevaFor more information or to set up an interview contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa: +41 79 7084367 and Andrew Thomas: +41 76 3676587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

In the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony.

Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year.

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity.

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. In this way the individual needs of each person is considered.To provide appropriate care, we must recognize what gender stereotypes and roles are present, what are the ideas and practices in the community about menstrual health, and how our humanitarian assistance programs can address the needs of menstruating people.”For more information, please see the following links toIFRC guidelines and toolkits for managing the menstrual health of people affected by emergencies and disasters. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

International Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons
In the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

International Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons
In the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

With too many wars raging and tensions rising, we must uphold international humanitarian law and the vision of a mine-free world
Geneva, 04 april 2025: Joint statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden National Red Cross SocietiesRecent announcements by several states in northern and central Europe on their decision to withdraw from the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention mark a dangerous setback for the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The trend must be reversed.As the secretary general of a worldwide humanitarian federation, a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies with more than 16 million staff and volunteers, I’m well used to trauma. Of those, 32 were members of our Red Cross or Red Crescent societies, including 18 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. There must be tangible consequences for those who commit the atrocity of killing – through malice or recklessness – humanitarians trying to help.Third, other governments have a duty to put diplomatic and political pressure on their peers.This week, leaders of the Palestine Red Crescent Society have travelled from the West Bank to New York to brief the UN security council and demand more protection for humanitarian workers. In Geneva, I have made “protect humanity” central to my engagement with governments, publicly and privately.But at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) we tread a fine line. The project was done in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which launched a global emergency appeal within days of the initital earthquakesShe also received critical help through another collaborative TRC and IFRC programme that aims to ensure the safety and protection of people who are often particularly vulnerable following a large-scale disaster – women, children, the elderly and the disabled.Those efforts include financial aid that can provide people with greater stability and independence while also helping them meet other urgent needs such as health care, access to medicine, education opportunities, legal help or psychological support.Such services greatly reduce the chances that people in vulnerable situations are further harmed, abused or exploited, and they greatly increase the chances for a full and dignified recovery.In Canan’s case, the program enabled her to access health services for physiotherapy and treatment to restore her eyelid function.Though she still cannot see from one eye, Canan feels immense relief and gratitude for the chance to regain her confidence.“They supported me a lot,” she says of the Red Crescent. According to the study, 88 percent of the people who participated in the project reported improved living conditions.Thefollow-up assessment of the programme, known as Post-Distribution Monitoring, reveals that 51 percent of those who took part used the provided assistance to reduce or eliminate health-related protection risks.Ninety-five percent of people also reported improved household communication and relationships, reinforcing the broader social benefits of the assistance.By Sevil ErkuşSenior Communications Officer, IFRC Türkiye Delegation

‘Protect Humanity’ event commemorates humanitarians killed this year 
Geneva, 5 December - As the world’s largest humanitarian network, the IFRC’s message is clear: violence against humanitarian workers must stop. This is among the highest levels of global violence against IFRC network teams that we have ever experienced.The protection of civilians, humanitarians, healthcare workers and facilities is not just a legal and moral obligation, but a pressing concern that demands immediate attention.Seven Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies have experienced death and loss in 2024: Palestine Red Crescent Society (18 people), Sudanese Red Crescent (eight people), Iranian Red Crescent (two people), Algerian Red Crescent (one person), Ethiopian Red Cross Society (one person), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo (one person) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one person).In the lead-up to International Volunteer Day on 5 December, 26 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world – including, among others, Palestine, Syria, Venezuela, Italy, America, Greece, Netherlands, Nigeria, Singapore, Slovenia and Pakistan - are gathering in their cities to pay tribute to the colleagues we have lost this year. IFRCUnder Secretary General for Global Relations and Humanitarian Diplomacy,Nena Stoiljkovic, anda Geneva Red Cross volunteer spoke, and the names of the colleagues we have lost this year were read out, with candles, the Red Cross Red Crescent emblems, and pictures of those colleagues as a backdrop, providing a powerful and moving visual.AV materials are also available here from the different National Societies taking part globally (regularly updated as events happen).For more information or to request an interview, please contact: [email protected] Geneva: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367 Hannah Copeland, +41 76 236 91 09

International Volunteer Day: In the Philippines, volunteers brought unwavering support in the face of six devastating typhoons
In the course of just two months – October to November 2024 – the Philippines were hit with an unrelenting onslaught of destructive typhoons, each one bringing floods and landslides that devastated communities.With over 10 million people affected, the disasters have left a trail of destruction and heartache. But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco. Additionally, the Red Cross runs the ""Action and Coexistence Program,"" which promotes inclusion and fosters values of tolerance, respect, and non-discrimination to prevent violence among children and adolescents.Honduras: The Red Cross manages a center for unaccompanied migrant children and returned migrant families, providing administrative assistance, healthcare, psychosocial support, and promoting social reintegration.Panama: The Red Cross develops programs such as educational brigades and ""Blue Schools,"" which create safe environments in educational spaces, encourage environmental care, and support mental health. It also operates a child protection shelter in coordination with the government, offering healthcare, education, and psychosocial support to children aged 0 to 12.Mexico: The Red Cross has developed a child protection policy and program led by national youth teams to address the protection and mental health needs of children during emergencies and along migratory routes.Costa Rica: The Red Cross collaborates with organizations like World Vision and UNICEF on child protection and participation projects in emergencies, as well as providing medical care and nutrition support for children and adolescents in migratory contexts.Guatemala: In coordination with public officials, Red Cross volunteers offer health and mental health care, humanitarian assistance, and support for returned migrant children. Additionally, they run an awareness program on health, hygiene, and first aid, featuring cartoon characters who teach children about these topics.Ecuador: The Red Cross operates safe spaces for children in migratory contexts, supported by a child protection policy aligned with its national policy on protection, gender, and inclusion. It also runs early childhood projects that assist families with children aged 0 to 6, ensuring protection and family preservation.Trinidad and Tobago: Red Cross volunteers promote access to education and psychosocial support through child-friendly spaces.Cayman Islands: The Red Cross runs an educational YouTube program with animated characters, ""Bobo and Teedee,"" which teach children about hygiene, health, safety, and family coexistence in an engaging way. We continue to witness an escalation of violence which is further undermining efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and uphold human dignity.We live in a world, where fragmentation threatens unity, where disregard for international humanitarian law has become alarmingly commonplace, and where our humanitarian principles are continuously challenged and misinterpreted.Humanitarian assistance requires an enabling environment, free of conditions and pressure, so it can reach everyone in need, without exception.It is time to prioritize dialogue and peace for those who are caught in the crossfire of conflicts and other crises.It is time for the guns to fall silent. “So it's really important that we listen to young volunteers and that we give them space to really shape the direction we're heading.”

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making. Van Rossum was the youngest person to have ever served as youth representative on the IFRC Governing Board as chairman of the Youth Commission.Now, nine years later, he steps down as president of IFRC’s Youth Commission, but he still champions the role of youth in setting the course of humanitarian response.“Young people are perhaps the closest to the front lines,” he said, in a special episode of the People in the Red Vest podcast, recorded as the Youth Forum was underway. Milena Chacón from the Costa Rican Red Cross moderated a panel with IFRC President Kate Forbes, who talked about a wide range of issues, including migration challenges in her home state of Arizona, in the southern United States, focusing on the trauma faced by children.She highlighted a program by a young Mexican Red Cross volunteer that helps migrant children express their feelings. Forbes shared her journey from local volunteer to president of the IFRC, emphasizing the Red Cross's role in developing management skills and youth engagement.Forbes also addressed the need for diversity in youth councils, advocating for gender balance and inclusion of people with disabilities to inspire more diverse leadership.For their part, the young volunteers in the audience expressed the importance of being involved in diverse parts of the network, and the importance of having a voice in finding and implementing global solutions.Youth Engagement Strategy 2024One panel discussion led by Maryna Kozhedub, a volunteer with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, explored the challenges young people face today.Luciana Marino from the Argentine Red Cross discussed three key issues affecting young people in South America: poverty, unemployment, and migration. He emphasized the need for a more open and understanding environment between generations.What is the IFRC General Assembly?As the supreme body of the IFRC, the Assembly meets every two years and determines the vision and strategy of the IFRC, and the general policies that govern the International Federation and the National Societies.Key elements such as trust and integrity, localization, volunteering and investing in National Societies have guided the preparations for the Statutory Meetings, which will provide an opportunity to discuss how we can remain relevant as an organization.This year, the Assembly took place along with an International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which is hosted along with the International Committee of the Red Cross.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day: IFRC to Host ‘Stand in Solidarity’ Event and launch ‘#ProtectHumanity’ campaign
Geneva, 19 August 2024 - The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) will join the global community today (Monday) in marking World Humanitarian Day. This year, the day takes on a deeper urgency as we confront alarming levels of violence against humanitarian workers.In 2024 alone, 28 IFRC staff and volunteers have tragically lost their lives while performing their lifesaving duties.To address this growing crisis, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign, #ProtectHumanity, to draw attention to the critical need for the protection of humanitarian workers and the civilians they serve.As part of this campaign, the IFRC will join the ‘Stand in Solidarity’ initiative, organized by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), to demand urgent action. This event serves to remind States and other parties of their moral and legal obligations to protect humanitarian workers and civilians.The IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“Since the start of this year, 28 of our volunteers and staff have died or been tragically killed while performing their humanitarian duties. Today on World Humanitarian Day, the IFRC is launching a public awareness campaign to shed light on the need to protect humanitarian workers.""We must raise awareness of the urgent need to protect people in crises, but especially our volunteers and staff, who risk their lives daily to help and save others.""While the IFRC network and our volunteers are committed to serving those in need, their safety and protection ultimately lie beyond our direct control.

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making. Julia Klock, a medical volunteer who paused her regular work to volunteer with the Brazilian Red Cross during the floods.While menstruation is as natural as eating, or sleeping, too often, people are reluctant to talk about the lack ofessential menstrual health products because this topic is sometimes seen as embarrassing or awkward — something to be hidden. This year, World Menstruation Day takes on the theme ""Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld"" in order to fully normalizie menstruation and to render these taboos to history.In order to help us unpack this issue, we asked Katherine Fuentes, the protection, gender and inclusion coordinator for the IFRC in the Americas, to tell us what top things peopleshould be talking about when it comes tomenstruation and hygiene during and after a major crisis.Access to menstrual hygiene products.“When a disaster occurs, such as the recent floods in Brazil, access to menstrual products becomes more difficult.That is why the emergency items we distribute include menstrual hygiene products, considering how many people of menstruating age have been affected by the disaster.These hygiene products can range from sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups to menstrual panties, cloth pads, hygiene buckets, among others.Clean, safe and private facilitiesWe seek to ensure that menstruating individuals have access to clean drinking water, clean restrooms, and private spaces to change and dispose of waste properly. • Minimum Standards for PGI in Emergencies • Guidance for Addressing Menstrual Hygiene Management NeedsFor donations or more information about the floods in Brazil, visit our Emergency Appeal

In memoriam
When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

But through it all, volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross Society have been there, in communities around the country, offering support and comfort to those in need.Felisa Buquel, a volunteer from the Isabela chapter has been out there every day, working in evacuation centres, talking, listening and conducting damage assessments to ensure that people get the support they need to recover and rebuild.

International Volunteer Day: ‘We will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end’
Walking into the room where emergency medical teams keep their belongings while on duty, Palestine Red Crescent paramedic Jihad Mansour says there isn’t a day that goes by when he doesn’t think of colleagues who have fallen in the line of their duty.“Every time I open thelocker, memories of my dear friend and colleague Fadi Al-Maani come back to me,” he says, referring to a fellow paramedic who was killed while trying to save lives in the Gaza Strip during the last year.In 2024, International Volunteers Day [5 December] comes at the end of a year that has proven to be one of the worst in terms of the safety of humanitarian workers. On this day, we honor the contributions and sacrifices of volunteers around the world while also working to ensure all volunteers are protected from harm.This year so far, at least30 Red Crescent and Red Cross volunteers have died in the line of duty. Among them were Fadi Al-Maani, Youssef Abu Muammar, Fouad Abu Khammash, Muhammad Al-Omari, my colleague and close friend with whom I used to work closely, in the same ambulance.”The constant state of emergency, and heightened security, displacement of families means that volunteers are often separated from their friends and families — and their regular routines that bring them joy — just like the people they are working to help.“We used to gather family, friends and colleagues to enjoy each other's company but now those moments are just a memory overshadowed by the violence and brutality of this war,” says Jihad.“We enjoyed a lot of beautiful days and years together and losing them deeply affected us, leaving us emotionally drained. But we will continue our humanitarian mission until the very end.”

International law expert and Red Cross VP: humanity must seize on critical chance to get ahead of advancing technology 
With new technologies changing our lives in rapid and radical ways, Vasilka Sancin says this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. At the first Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence against Children, held in Bogotá on 7 – 8 November and hosted by the governments of Colombia and Sweden, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is calling for bold, immediate action to uphold children’s rights.“Governments, organizations, and communities must recognize the long-term consequences of failing to protect children,” said Gurvinder Singh, IFRC Senior Advisor on Child Protection. This is especially true for those children too often left out and left behind in their communities, such as those with disabilities.Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies bring vast experience in implementing localized programs to protect children from violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IFRC collaborates with Ministries of Education, Health, and Climate, as well as local agencies and researchers, to develop risk-forecasting systems that protect children from violence and exploitation, particularly in climate-related disasters such as heatwaves and floods.“Protecting children from violence and disasters is a shared responsibility, and we are – and will continue to be - dedicated to working with communities, public officials and children themselves to ensure that no child grows up hopeless or in fear,” said Colombian Red Cross President, Dr. “Our humanitarian network’s 16 million volunteers uniquely reinforce children’s participation, community systems and key services that uphold children’s rights and well-being"".For more information and to set up an interview, please contact: [email protected] Colombia – Rafael Payares +573135644837In Panama - Susana Arroyo Barrantes +50769993199In Geneva – Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Hannah Copeland +41762369109Notes for editors:Examples of the Red Cross’ work on child protection in the Americas include:Colombia: The Red Cross is implementing a child protection project in areas affected by armed conflict (also active in Honduras) and developing mechanisms for safeguarding children in Nariño and Tumaco.

From Geneva, with love: Red Cross Red Crescent meetings kick off with call to protect humanitarian workers and to put young volunteers in the driver’s seat
As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making.

As Red Cross and Red Crescent representatives from around the world gathered in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday, IFRC president Kate Forbes laid out what is at stake for humanitarian workers and people impacted by natural disasters, conflict and other crises.“Today, our work is increasingly difficult,” she told the gathering. “Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.“The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission.”In 2024 alone, she noted, the IFRC network of National Societies has lost 30 of its volunteers in the line of duty. The most recent death was a Sudanese volunteer named Sadel, killed while providing life-saving assistance at his local hospital.“Each loss is a deep one for both the communities we serve and for our global network, weakening our ability to support those in need -- but not weakening our resolve to directly address these crises,” she continued.As part of its ongoing efforts to protect humanitarian workers, the IFRC launched the Protect Humanity campaign earlier this year to build awareness and rally support with protection of volunteers and staff.During the opening ceremony for the Statutory Meetings of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which include the General Assembly, The Council of Delegates and the International Conference, Forbes also announced the establishment of The Red Family Fund, designed to provide financial support to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.“This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,” she told those gathered.The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, also spoke at the opening ceremony. The responses were used to generate online surveys and even a word cloud that envisioned a future centered on youth, community, resilience, and innovation.Youth Forum sets the stageSetting the stage for the General Assembly, the 2024 IFRC Youth Forum got underway on 22 October with 85 Red Cross and Red Crescent youth representatives from around the world participating.""I want to congratulate you for speaking up for young people,” IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain told the gathering, adding that he remains committed to ensuring that young volunteers and leaders play a key role in influencing strategy and decision making.

‘The worst year for humanitarians’:  IFRC Secretary General at UN General Assembly presses for urgent action to protect humanitarian workers  
The vast majority of humanitarians killed in the last decade are not foreign aid workers, but local humanitarians who often face grave dangers simply trying to save lives in the communities where they live, IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says in this special episode, recorded during the United Nations General Assembly in late September. In the last two weeks, we’ve seen an alarming escalation of hostilities in Lebanon too.Everywhere, National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have responded immediately, mobilising ambulances and volunteers to provide medical care, assist the injured, and deliver essential humanitarian aid to the people affected.Despite the exceptionally dangerous conditions and continuous barriers to access, our teams have remained resolute in their commitment to helping people in need.Tragically, many have paid the ultimate price in their service to humanity: 27 staff and volunteers have been killed on duty during this crisis, six from Magen David Adom in Israel and 21 from the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza and the West Bank.Today, we honour their memory and express our solidarity with all victims of the conflict.We mourn these tragic losses, and we remain deeply concerned that this conflict continues to escalate, causing more humanitarian suffering throughout the region.Humanitarians and civilians must be respected and protected.Hostages must come home.Bombs must stop falling.Humanity must prevail.""The above statement can be attributed to the IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain.Our calls:The IFRC takes no side other than the side of humanity. We reiterate our calls on all parties to:Protect civilians, humanitarians, and healthcare workers and facilities.The Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems must be respected and protected, and all parties must ensure the safety of those providing humanitarian aid.Ensure safe and unhindered access for aid and essential services,everywhere in the Gaza Strip.Open all available border crossings to ensure a continuous and expanded flow of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies and food, and fuel into Gaza, especially through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.Immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.For more information or to request an interview, please contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey El Sayegh, +961 03 229 352In Budapest:Nora Peter, +36 70 953 7709In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa, +41 79 708 4367Andrew Thomas, +41 76 367 6587

World Humanitarian Day 2024: The time is now to #ActforHumanity and #ProtectHumanity
It’s only natural that when we hear of danger — an outbreak of infectious disease, rising flood waters, a fast-moving fire or of people being injured by violence – that we instinctively want to go the other way.But there is also a natural human instinct to want to help and, if necessary, move toward the impending danger to see what we can do.Today, on World Humanitarian Day (19 August, 2024) we honor those around the world who #ActforHumanity every day by facing any number of dangers in order to bring life-saving first-aid, medical attention or other forms help to people impacted by the crisis.We also demand, via the IFRC's #ProtectHumanity campaign launched today, that all humanitarian volunteers and workers are fully protected from harm or violence as they carry out their life-saving work.Ordinary herosThese volunteers and humanitarian workers are not super-heroes. They have been trained to handle difficult situations and protect themselves as best as possible but that training cannot fully protect them if they are not given the full respect, access and support they deserve as they work urgently to save lives.They are people likeHélène Mula, a volunteer with the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who brings life-saving information to communities now confronted with a deadly emerging mpox outbreak.“At first I was scared about going into communities to talk about mpox and the risks,”she says. I am a volunteer, I have no choice but to go and try to save lives.”Or it’s people like Dil Mohammed, aged 46, one of roughly 3,300 Red Cross Red Crescent volunteers who serve as the bedrock of community readiness and emergency response within the Cox’s Bazar settlements for displaced people in Bangladesh.Dil is one of the many unsung heroes of disaster preparedness and response in a place where cyclones pose a perpetual threat. “But the volunteers never stop helping others … They are the heroes for humanity at this time.”Now Alburai works as a Red Cross volunteer in Slovenia where he helps fellow refugees cope in their new surroundings.Time to #ActforHumanity and#ProtectHumanity All these volunteers are an example of the many different ways humanitarian volunteers and workers are making a difference and saving lives despite the multiple dangers they themselves face. Today on World Humanitarian Day, we honor such volunteers and we demand they get the support, protection and respect they deserve.Sadly, the world is now failing humanitarian workers and the people they serve. This year alone, 28 Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian volunteers have been killed in the line of duty — killed while simply trying to save the lives of others.This is why today we launch theProtect Humanity Campaign, which demands safety and protection for humanitarian workers and highlights the alarming number of our volunteers and staff who have been killed while performing their duties since the beginning of the year.In a joint statement announcing the campaign, IFRC President, Kate Forbes, and the IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain, said:“This period has seen some of the highest levels of global violence against our volunteers and staff. We have reached a tipping point where we must demand the safety and protection of our workers.""The IFRC asks you to join this campaign, launched during a 'Stand in Solidarity' event at IFRC headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on World Humanitarian Day. And they need us standing behind them.“We will not stop what we do as Red Cross Red Crescent Movement,”he says. If we still continue acting like this, what kind of future we will be building for the future?”

Statement by IFRC President Kate Forbes to the International Conference on the Humanitarian Response for Gaza
Excellencies, distinguished delegates and colleagues,When I assumed the presidency of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), I never imagined that my first visit would be to Gaza and Israel—a profoundly emotional and profoundly challenging experience.The crisis in Gaza is not solely a humanitarian catastrophe; it is a deeply entrenched diplomatic impasse needing our urgent attention.Since taking office, I have had the heartbreaking duty of writing 24 condolence letters for the loss of our dedicated volunteers and staff -20 from Palestine Red Crescent Society and 4 from Magen David Adom in Israel. Healthcare and humanitarian aid workers and their facilities must be always protected, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.Similarly, nothing can justify killing innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict not of their making.

When crisis strikes, Red Cross and Red Crescent staff and volunteers are often the first on the scene. In 2024, 32 Red Cross and Red Crescent staff members and volunteers lost their lives in the line of duty. Geneva, 02 February 2024:The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is shocked and deeply saddened by the killing of three members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in the Gaza Strip - one staff member and one volunteer on 31 January 2024 and one staff member on 2 February 2024.In the first incident, two colleagues, Naeem Hasan Al-Jabali and Khalid Kulab, were both near the gate of the PRCS Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis when they were killed. Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

Today, Hedaya Hamad was killed at the PRCS headquarters, which is in the same compound as the Al-Amal hospital.These deaths came after several days of shelling and fighting around the hospital which hindered access to the premises and created panic and distress among patients and thousands of displaced people.The IFRC sends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed and to their friends and colleagues at the Palestine Red Crescent Society.Under International Humanitarian Law, hospitals, ambulances, healthcare workers, and their patients must be respected and protected in every situation.Any attack on healthcare workers, ambulances, and medical facilities is unacceptable.We strongly reiterate our call for unwavering respect for the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal emblems and the crucial humanitarian services they represent.The IFRC stands with the PRCS, urging protection for all medical facilities and workers. This is unacceptable.For more information or to request an interview, contact:[email protected] Beirut:Mey Al Sayegh: +961 761 74468In Geneva:Tommaso Della Longa +41797084367Mrinalini Santhanam +41 76 381 5006Andrew Thomas +41 76 367 6587

More than a third of women experience lasting health problems after childbirth, new research shows
Beyond pregnancy: experts call for greater attention to the long-term health challenges of women and girls in special Lancet Series

7 December 2023

Departmental update


    Reading time:
    



 















Every year, at least 40 million women are likely to experience a long-term health problem caused by childbirth, according to a new study published today in The Lancet Global Health. These include pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), affecting more than a third (35%) of postpartum women, low back pain (32%), anal incontinence (19%), urinary incontinence (8-31%), anxiety (9-24%), depression (11-17%), perineal pain (11%), fear of childbirth (tokophobia) (6-15%) and secondary infertility (11%).The authors of the paper call for greater recognition within the healthcare system of these common problems, many of which occur beyond the point where women typically have access to postnatal services. Data gaps are also significant: there were no nationally representative or global studies for any of the conditions identified through the research.Taken as a whole, the Series, titled Maternal health in the perinatal period and beyond, calls for greater attention to the long-term health of women and girls – after and also before pregnancy. “There are many factors that influence the likelihood a woman will have a healthy pregnancy, from the environment around her to the political and economic systems she lives in, to access to nutritious food and the level of agency she has over her life – all of these factors need to be addressed to improve her health, alongside access to high quality healthcare throughout life.”Fundamentally, the Series argues for a strong, multidisciplinary health system, that not only provides high quality, respectful maternity services but also prevents ill health and mitigates the impact of broader inequities - including specific interventions that support the most vulnerable women and girls.Notes to editorsThe Series can be accessed here: www.thelancet.com/series/maternal-perinatal-healthAbout the SeriesThe Series is published in The Lancet Global Health and eClinicalMedicine. It consists of four papers:A global analysis of the determinants of maternal health and transitions in maternal mortalityVulnerabilities and reparative strategies during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period: moving from rhetoric to actionNeglected medium-term and long-term consequences of labour and childbirth: a systematic analysis of the burden, recommended practices, and a way forwardTowards a better tomorrow: Addressing intersectional gender power relations to eradicate inequities in maternal healthAbout the dataWithin the third paper, long-term postpartum conditions are defined as those that occur more than six weeks postpartum, which is the period when postnatal care usually stops.
