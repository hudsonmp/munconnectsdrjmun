"Maritime Safety Committee (MSC 107), 31 May-9 June 2023",https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/MeetingSummaries/Pages/MSC-107th-session.aspx,other,0.8909090909090909,,"Highlights Adoption of amendments MASS Code developmentSafe delivery of IMO's strategy on reduction of GHG emissions Resolution on ""Strengthening measures for ensuring the safety of international shipping"" Maritime security, piracy and armed robbery against shipsMandatory reporting of lost containers – draft SOLAS amendmentsCertification and training for fishers – revised 1995 STCW-F Convention STCW training provisions on bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain – draft Assembly resolution approved Proposals for new work programme outputs  Other matters – Sub-Committees' workRead more below:1. Adoption of amendments SOLAS amendments Safety of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winchesMSC adopted a new SOLAS regulation II-1/3-13 that covers requirements for the application, design and construction, operation, inspection, testing and maintenance of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches. Safety measures for non-SOLAS ships operating in polar waters - Polar Code and SOLAS MSC adopted a first set of amendments to the Polar Code, together with associated amendments to the SOLAS Convention, to incorporate new requirements concerning safety of navigation and voyage planning, applicable to fishing vessels of 24 m in length overall and above, pleasure yachts of 300 GT and above not engaged in trade and cargo ships of 300 GT and above but below 500 GT, operating in polar waters.The amendments are expected to enter into force on 1 January 2026.STCW Convention amendments related to electronic certificates MSC adopted amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, regulation I/2 (Certificates and endorsements), and the corresponding section of the Seafarers' Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) Code, related to electronic certificates. International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code amendments MSC adopted the latest set of amendments to the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code, following finalization by the Editorial & Technical Group. As usual, these amendments were adopted in the form of a consolidated version of the whole IMSBC Code and will enter into force on 1 January 2025, with voluntary application from 1 January 2024.The MSC also approved related circulars on: Guidelines for the submission of information and completion of the format for the properties of cargoes not listed in the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and their conditions of carriage; Guidelines for developing and approving procedures for sampling, testing and controlling the moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation; and Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective.2. A MASS Working Group was established to progress the work on the MASS Code and to identify issues that are relevant to instruments under the purview of the Legal and Facilitation Committee, to be considered by the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS, which was established as a cross-cutting mechanism to address common issues identified by the regulatory scoping exercises for the use of MASS conducted by the Maritime Safety, Legal and Facilitation Committees.The MSC noted, in particular, the common position of the Group on training, certification and competency requirements, namely that: 1. The MSC, after noting the progress made in developing the draft goal-based non-mandatory MASS Code, approved the updated road map for the further work.The Correspondence Group was re-established to, inter alia: continue the development of the non-mandatory goal-based MASS Code; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the Regulatory Scoping Exercise (RSE) (MSC.1/Circ.1638, section 5), focusing on the high priority items; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Correspondence Group Coordinator will report orally to the Intersessional MASS Working Group (MASS ISWG), which will meet in October 2023.The MASS ISWG was instructed by the Committee to continue the development of the MASS Code, taking into account the latest draft prepared by the Correspondence Group; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the RSE; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Working Group on Goal-based New Ship Construction Standards (GBS) considered examples of functional requirements (FRs) for the MASS Code and provided some observations and recommendations for the MASS Working Group, in particular, that an appropriate hazard identification (HAZID) study should be conducted to provide the necessary tool for identifying relevant hazards, mitigating functions, and expected performances (EPs) and associated funcitonal requirements (FRs).The Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS has developed a table – intended as a living document – to identify preferred options for addressing common issues, such as the role, responsibilities competencies required of the master and crew for MASS; and identification and meaning of term ""remote operator"" and their responsibilities. Draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpointThe MSC approved draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpoint, with a view for subsequent adoption. A new generic provision is added after existing paragraph 2.1.8: ""Oil fuel delivered to and used on board ships shall not jeopardize the safety of ships or adversely affect the performance of the machinery or be harmful to personnel.""Guidelines for safety of ships using LPG MSC approved Interim Guidelines for the safety of ships using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).The basic philosophy of these Interim Guidelines is to provide provisions for the arrangement, installation, control and monitoring of machinery, equipment and systems using LPG as fuel to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and the environment, having regard to the nature of the fuels involved.The guidelines were developed by the CCC Sub-Committee, as part of the important work being carried out by the Sub-Committee in the context of shipping's need for new fuels and propulsion systems to meet decarbonization ambitions set out in the Initial IMO GHG Strategy.Matters related to innovative types of fuel are considered under the CCC agenda item on the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code) and development of guidelines for alternative fuels and related technologies. Interim guidelines for ships using fuel cells were approved by MSC 105 in April 2022 (MSC.1/Circ.1647).Safe operation of onshore power supply service – interim guidelines approvedThe MSC approved Interim guidelines on safe operation of onshore power supply service in port for ships engaged on international voyages.New output on safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels The MSC considered proposals for a new output to deliver a framework for the safe operation of new technologies and alternative fuels aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, to support the safe delivery of IMO's GHG Strategy.Having noted the overwhelming support for the proposal, the MSC agreed to new output on ""Development of a safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels"", to be added to the MSC agenda, starting with MSC 108. STCW training provisions on bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) approved MSC approved, for subsequent adoption at MSC 108, draft amendments to the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Code, to prevent and respond to bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH). Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain – draft Assembly resolution approved MSC approved a draft Assembly resolution on Recommendations emanating from the Joint Action Group to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain (JAG-TSC).The draft resolution endorses and recommends a number of actions to address the impact of measures taken during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEICs) affecting transport sectors and their workers, and to encourage improved coordination at the national level within affected countries. Other mattersFollowing work in the Sub-Committees, and consideration of their reports, MSC 107:Adopted amendments to the 1979, 1989 and 2009 Codes for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU Codes) to prohibit materials which contain asbestos; approve a related unified interpretation, to clarify that existing materials stowed on board before 1 January 2024 are not prohibited from being retained on board but should not be installed unless they can be documented to be asbestos-free before use/installation; and approve draft new guidelines for maintenance and monitoring of materials containing asbestos on board MODUs.Adopted the 2023 Diving Code, which updates the Code of Safety for Diving systems (resolution A.831(19)) and the Guidelines and specifications for Hyperbaric Evacuation Systems (resolution A.692(17)) for ships of not less than 500 gross tonnage that have a diving system installed on or after 1 January 2024; and approved, for future adoption, amendments to the IGF Code, including those related to pressure relief system and provide requirements for ships constructed after 1 January 2026.Approved, for future adoption, amendments to the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (Grain Code), introducing a new class of loading conditions for ""specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed"" and specify the requirements under which grain may be carried in such compartments. Approved, for future adoption, draft amendments to the International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers, 2011 (ESP Code), relating to the procedures for approval and certification of a firm engaged in thickness measurement of hull structures contained in the Code, so as to permit Administrations to exercise the right of auditing a company conducting thickness measurement of hull structures. Approved, for future adoption, draft amendments to the LSA Code on lowering speed of survival craft and rescue boats; lifejackets' in-water performance; and single fall and hook systems, together with consequential amendments to associated instruments.Approved, for future adoption, draft amendments to SOLAS chapter II-2 on fire safety on ro-ro passenger ships; and fire detection within control stations and cargo control rooms, together with consequential amendments to associated instruments.Adopted amendments to the Revised performance standards for water level detectors on ships subject to SOLAS regulations II-1/25, II-1/25-1 and XII/12 (resolution MSC.188(79)/Rev.1). ***List of Resolutions adopted by MSC 107 RESOLUTION MSC.531(107) – STRENGTHENING MEASURES FOR ENSURING THE SAFETY OF

Safety measures for non-SOLAS ships operating in polar waters - Polar Code and SOLAS MSC adopted a first set of amendments to the Polar Code, together with associated amendments to the SOLAS Convention, to incorporate new requirements concerning safety of navigation and voyage planning, applicable to fishing vessels of 24 m in length overall and above, pleasure yachts of 300 GT and above not engaged in trade and cargo ships of 300 GT and above but below 500 GT, operating in polar waters.The amendments are expected to enter into force on 1 January 2026.STCW Convention amendments related to electronic certificates MSC adopted amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, regulation I/2 (Certificates and endorsements), and the corresponding section of the Seafarers' Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) Code, related to electronic certificates. International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code amendments MSC adopted the latest set of amendments to the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code, following finalization by the Editorial & Technical Group. As usual, these amendments were adopted in the form of a consolidated version of the whole IMSBC Code and will enter into force on 1 January 2025, with voluntary application from 1 January 2024.The MSC also approved related circulars on: Guidelines for the submission of information and completion of the format for the properties of cargoes not listed in the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and their conditions of carriage; Guidelines for developing and approving procedures for sampling, testing and controlling the moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation; and Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective.2. A MASS Working Group was established to progress the work on the MASS Code and to identify issues that are relevant to instruments under the purview of the Legal and Facilitation Committee, to be considered by the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS, which was established as a cross-cutting mechanism to address common issues identified by the regulatory scoping exercises for the use of MASS conducted by the Maritime Safety, Legal and Facilitation Committees.The MSC noted, in particular, the common position of the Group on training, certification and competency requirements, namely that: 1. The MSC, after noting the progress made in developing the draft goal-based non-mandatory MASS Code, approved the updated road map for the further work.The Correspondence Group was re-established to, inter alia: continue the development of the non-mandatory goal-based MASS Code; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the Regulatory Scoping Exercise (RSE) (MSC.1/Circ.1638, section 5), focusing on the high priority items; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Correspondence Group Coordinator will report orally to the Intersessional MASS Working Group (MASS ISWG), which will meet in October 2023.The MASS ISWG was instructed by the Committee to continue the development of the MASS Code, taking into account the latest draft prepared by the Correspondence Group; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the RSE; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Working Group on Goal-based New Ship Construction Standards (GBS) considered examples of functional requirements (FRs) for the MASS Code and provided some observations and recommendations for the MASS Working Group, in particular, that an appropriate hazard identification (HAZID) study should be conducted to provide the necessary tool for identifying relevant hazards, mitigating functions, and expected performances (EPs) and associated funcitonal requirements (FRs).The Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS has developed a table – intended as a living document – to identify preferred options for addressing common issues, such as the role, responsibilities competencies required of the master and crew for MASS; and identification and meaning of term ""remote operator"" and their responsibilities. Draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpointThe MSC approved draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpoint, with a view for subsequent adoption. A new generic provision is added after existing paragraph 2.1.8: ""Oil fuel delivered to and used on board ships shall not jeopardize the safety of ships or adversely affect the performance of the machinery or be harmful to personnel.""Guidelines for safety of ships using LPG MSC approved Interim Guidelines for the safety of ships using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).The basic philosophy of these Interim Guidelines is to provide provisions for the arrangement, installation, control and monitoring of machinery, equipment and systems using LPG as fuel to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and the environment, having regard to the nature of the fuels involved.The guidelines were developed by the CCC Sub-Committee, as part of the important work being carried out by the Sub-Committee in the context of shipping's need for new fuels and propulsion systems to meet decarbonization ambitions set out in the Initial IMO GHG Strategy.Matters related to innovative types of fuel are considered under the CCC agenda item on the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code) and development of guidelines for alternative fuels and related technologies. Interim guidelines for ships using fuel cells were approved by MSC 105 in April 2022 (MSC.1/Circ.1647).Safe operation of onshore power supply service – interim guidelines approvedThe MSC approved Interim guidelines on safe operation of onshore power supply service in port for ships engaged on international voyages.New output on safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels The MSC considered proposals for a new output to deliver a framework for the safe operation of new technologies and alternative fuels aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, to support the safe delivery of IMO's GHG Strategy.Having noted the overwhelming support for the proposal, the MSC agreed to new output on ""Development of a safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels"", to be added to the MSC agenda, starting with MSC 108. STCW training provisions on bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) approved MSC approved, for subsequent adoption at MSC 108, draft amendments to the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Code, to prevent and respond to bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH). Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain – draft Assembly resolution approved MSC approved a draft Assembly resolution on Recommendations emanating from the Joint Action Group to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain (JAG-TSC).The draft resolution endorses and recommends a number of actions to address the impact of measures taken during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEICs) affecting transport sectors and their workers, and to encourage improved coordination at the national level within affected countries. Other mattersFollowing work in the Sub-Committees, and consideration of their reports, MSC 107:Adopted amendments to the 1979, 1989 and 2009 Codes for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU Codes) to prohibit materials which contain asbestos; approve a related unified interpretation, to clarify that existing materials stowed on board before 1 January 2024 are not prohibited from being retained on board but should not be installed unless they can be documented to be asbestos-free before use/installation; and approve draft new guidelines for maintenance and monitoring of materials containing asbestos on board MODUs.Adopted the 2023 Diving Code, which updates the Code of Safety for Diving systems (resolution A.831(19)) and the Guidelines and specifications for Hyperbaric Evacuation Systems (resolution A.692(17)) for ships of not less than 500 gross tonnage that have a diving system installed on or after 1 January 2024; and approved, for future adoption, amendments to the IGF Code, including those related to pressure relief system and provide requirements for ships constructed after 1 January 2026.Approved, for future adoption, amendments to the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (Grain Code), introducing a new class of loading conditions for ""specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed"" and specify the requirements under which grain may be carried in such compartments.

Safety measures for non-SOLAS ships operating in polar waters - Polar Code and SOLAS MSC adopted a first set of amendments to the Polar Code, together with associated amendments to the SOLAS Convention, to incorporate new requirements concerning safety of navigation and voyage planning, applicable to fishing vessels of 24 m in length overall and above, pleasure yachts of 300 GT and above not engaged in trade and cargo ships of 300 GT and above but below 500 GT, operating in polar waters.The amendments are expected to enter into force on 1 January 2026.STCW Convention amendments related to electronic certificates MSC adopted amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, regulation I/2 (Certificates and endorsements), and the corresponding section of the Seafarers' Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) Code, related to electronic certificates. International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code amendments MSC adopted the latest set of amendments to the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code, following finalization by the Editorial & Technical Group. As usual, these amendments were adopted in the form of a consolidated version of the whole IMSBC Code and will enter into force on 1 January 2025, with voluntary application from 1 January 2024.The MSC also approved related circulars on: Guidelines for the submission of information and completion of the format for the properties of cargoes not listed in the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and their conditions of carriage; Guidelines for developing and approving procedures for sampling, testing and controlling the moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation; and Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective.2. A MASS Working Group was established to progress the work on the MASS Code and to identify issues that are relevant to instruments under the purview of the Legal and Facilitation Committee, to be considered by the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS, which was established as a cross-cutting mechanism to address common issues identified by the regulatory scoping exercises for the use of MASS conducted by the Maritime Safety, Legal and Facilitation Committees.The MSC noted, in particular, the common position of the Group on training, certification and competency requirements, namely that: 1. The MSC, after noting the progress made in developing the draft goal-based non-mandatory MASS Code, approved the updated road map for the further work.The Correspondence Group was re-established to, inter alia: continue the development of the non-mandatory goal-based MASS Code; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the Regulatory Scoping Exercise (RSE) (MSC.1/Circ.1638, section 5), focusing on the high priority items; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Correspondence Group Coordinator will report orally to the Intersessional MASS Working Group (MASS ISWG), which will meet in October 2023.The MASS ISWG was instructed by the Committee to continue the development of the MASS Code, taking into account the latest draft prepared by the Correspondence Group; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the RSE; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Working Group on Goal-based New Ship Construction Standards (GBS) considered examples of functional requirements (FRs) for the MASS Code and provided some observations and recommendations for the MASS Working Group, in particular, that an appropriate hazard identification (HAZID) study should be conducted to provide the necessary tool for identifying relevant hazards, mitigating functions, and expected performances (EPs) and associated funcitonal requirements (FRs).The Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS has developed a table – intended as a living document – to identify preferred options for addressing common issues, such as the role, responsibilities competencies required of the master and crew for MASS; and identification and meaning of term ""remote operator"" and their responsibilities. Draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpointThe MSC approved draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpoint, with a view for subsequent adoption. A new generic provision is added after existing paragraph 2.1.8: ""Oil fuel delivered to and used on board ships shall not jeopardize the safety of ships or adversely affect the performance of the machinery or be harmful to personnel.""Guidelines for safety of ships using LPG MSC approved Interim Guidelines for the safety of ships using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).The basic philosophy of these Interim Guidelines is to provide provisions for the arrangement, installation, control and monitoring of machinery, equipment and systems using LPG as fuel to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and the environment, having regard to the nature of the fuels involved.The guidelines were developed by the CCC Sub-Committee, as part of the important work being carried out by the Sub-Committee in the context of shipping's need for new fuels and propulsion systems to meet decarbonization ambitions set out in the Initial IMO GHG Strategy.Matters related to innovative types of fuel are considered under the CCC agenda item on the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code) and development of guidelines for alternative fuels and related technologies. Interim guidelines for ships using fuel cells were approved by MSC 105 in April 2022 (MSC.1/Circ.1647).Safe operation of onshore power supply service – interim guidelines approvedThe MSC approved Interim guidelines on safe operation of onshore power supply service in port for ships engaged on international voyages.New output on safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels The MSC considered proposals for a new output to deliver a framework for the safe operation of new technologies and alternative fuels aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, to support the safe delivery of IMO's GHG Strategy.Having noted the overwhelming support for the proposal, the MSC agreed to new output on ""Development of a safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels"", to be added to the MSC agenda, starting with MSC 108. STCW training provisions on bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) approved MSC approved, for subsequent adoption at MSC 108, draft amendments to the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Code, to prevent and respond to bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH). Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain – draft Assembly resolution approved MSC approved a draft Assembly resolution on Recommendations emanating from the Joint Action Group to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain (JAG-TSC).The draft resolution endorses and recommends a number of actions to address the impact of measures taken during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEICs) affecting transport sectors and their workers, and to encourage improved coordination at the national level within affected countries. Other mattersFollowing work in the Sub-Committees, and consideration of their reports, MSC 107:Adopted amendments to the 1979, 1989 and 2009 Codes for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU Codes) to prohibit materials which contain asbestos; approve a related unified interpretation, to clarify that existing materials stowed on board before 1 January 2024 are not prohibited from being retained on board but should not be installed unless they can be documented to be asbestos-free before use/installation; and approve draft new guidelines for maintenance and monitoring of materials containing asbestos on board MODUs.Adopted the 2023 Diving Code, which updates the Code of Safety for Diving systems (resolution A.831(19)) and the Guidelines and specifications for Hyperbaric Evacuation Systems (resolution A.692(17)) for ships of not less than 500 gross tonnage that have a diving system installed on or after 1 January 2024; and approved, for future adoption, amendments to the IGF Code, including those related to pressure relief system and provide requirements for ships constructed after 1 January 2026.Approved, for future adoption, amendments to the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (Grain Code), introducing a new class of loading conditions for ""specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed"" and specify the requirements under which grain may be carried in such compartments.

Safety measures for non-SOLAS ships operating in polar waters - Polar Code and SOLAS MSC adopted a first set of amendments to the Polar Code, together with associated amendments to the SOLAS Convention, to incorporate new requirements concerning safety of navigation and voyage planning, applicable to fishing vessels of 24 m in length overall and above, pleasure yachts of 300 GT and above not engaged in trade and cargo ships of 300 GT and above but below 500 GT, operating in polar waters.The amendments are expected to enter into force on 1 January 2026.STCW Convention amendments related to electronic certificates MSC adopted amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, regulation I/2 (Certificates and endorsements), and the corresponding section of the Seafarers' Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) Code, related to electronic certificates. International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code amendments MSC adopted the latest set of amendments to the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code, following finalization by the Editorial & Technical Group. As usual, these amendments were adopted in the form of a consolidated version of the whole IMSBC Code and will enter into force on 1 January 2025, with voluntary application from 1 January 2024.The MSC also approved related circulars on: Guidelines for the submission of information and completion of the format for the properties of cargoes not listed in the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and their conditions of carriage; Guidelines for developing and approving procedures for sampling, testing and controlling the moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation; and Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective.2. A MASS Working Group was established to progress the work on the MASS Code and to identify issues that are relevant to instruments under the purview of the Legal and Facilitation Committee, to be considered by the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS, which was established as a cross-cutting mechanism to address common issues identified by the regulatory scoping exercises for the use of MASS conducted by the Maritime Safety, Legal and Facilitation Committees.The MSC noted, in particular, the common position of the Group on training, certification and competency requirements, namely that: 1. The MSC, after noting the progress made in developing the draft goal-based non-mandatory MASS Code, approved the updated road map for the further work.The Correspondence Group was re-established to, inter alia: continue the development of the non-mandatory goal-based MASS Code; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the Regulatory Scoping Exercise (RSE) (MSC.1/Circ.1638, section 5), focusing on the high priority items; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Correspondence Group Coordinator will report orally to the Intersessional MASS Working Group (MASS ISWG), which will meet in October 2023.The MASS ISWG was instructed by the Committee to continue the development of the MASS Code, taking into account the latest draft prepared by the Correspondence Group; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the RSE; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Working Group on Goal-based New Ship Construction Standards (GBS) considered examples of functional requirements (FRs) for the MASS Code and provided some observations and recommendations for the MASS Working Group, in particular, that an appropriate hazard identification (HAZID) study should be conducted to provide the necessary tool for identifying relevant hazards, mitigating functions, and expected performances (EPs) and associated funcitonal requirements (FRs).The Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS has developed a table – intended as a living document – to identify preferred options for addressing common issues, such as the role, responsibilities competencies required of the master and crew for MASS; and identification and meaning of term ""remote operator"" and their responsibilities. Draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpointThe MSC approved draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpoint, with a view for subsequent adoption. A new generic provision is added after existing paragraph 2.1.8: ""Oil fuel delivered to and used on board ships shall not jeopardize the safety of ships or adversely affect the performance of the machinery or be harmful to personnel.""Guidelines for safety of ships using LPG MSC approved Interim Guidelines for the safety of ships using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).The basic philosophy of these Interim Guidelines is to provide provisions for the arrangement, installation, control and monitoring of machinery, equipment and systems using LPG as fuel to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and the environment, having regard to the nature of the fuels involved.The guidelines were developed by the CCC Sub-Committee, as part of the important work being carried out by the Sub-Committee in the context of shipping's need for new fuels and propulsion systems to meet decarbonization ambitions set out in the Initial IMO GHG Strategy.Matters related to innovative types of fuel are considered under the CCC agenda item on the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code) and development of guidelines for alternative fuels and related technologies. Interim guidelines for ships using fuel cells were approved by MSC 105 in April 2022 (MSC.1/Circ.1647).Safe operation of onshore power supply service – interim guidelines approvedThe MSC approved Interim guidelines on safe operation of onshore power supply service in port for ships engaged on international voyages.New output on safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels The MSC considered proposals for a new output to deliver a framework for the safe operation of new technologies and alternative fuels aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, to support the safe delivery of IMO's GHG Strategy.Having noted the overwhelming support for the proposal, the MSC agreed to new output on ""Development of a safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels"", to be added to the MSC agenda, starting with MSC 108. STCW training provisions on bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) approved MSC approved, for subsequent adoption at MSC 108, draft amendments to the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Code, to prevent and respond to bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH). Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain – draft Assembly resolution approved MSC approved a draft Assembly resolution on Recommendations emanating from the Joint Action Group to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain (JAG-TSC).The draft resolution endorses and recommends a number of actions to address the impact of measures taken during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEICs) affecting transport sectors and their workers, and to encourage improved coordination at the national level within affected countries. Other mattersFollowing work in the Sub-Committees, and consideration of their reports, MSC 107:Adopted amendments to the 1979, 1989 and 2009 Codes for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU Codes) to prohibit materials which contain asbestos; approve a related unified interpretation, to clarify that existing materials stowed on board before 1 January 2024 are not prohibited from being retained on board but should not be installed unless they can be documented to be asbestos-free before use/installation; and approve draft new guidelines for maintenance and monitoring of materials containing asbestos on board MODUs.Adopted the 2023 Diving Code, which updates the Code of Safety for Diving systems (resolution A.831(19)) and the Guidelines and specifications for Hyperbaric Evacuation Systems (resolution A.692(17)) for ships of not less than 500 gross tonnage that have a diving system installed on or after 1 January 2024; and approved, for future adoption, amendments to the IGF Code, including those related to pressure relief system and provide requirements for ships constructed after 1 January 2026.Approved, for future adoption, amendments to the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (Grain Code), introducing a new class of loading conditions for ""specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed"" and specify the requirements under which grain may be carried in such compartments.

Safety measures for non-SOLAS ships operating in polar waters - Polar Code and SOLAS MSC adopted a first set of amendments to the Polar Code, together with associated amendments to the SOLAS Convention, to incorporate new requirements concerning safety of navigation and voyage planning, applicable to fishing vessels of 24 m in length overall and above, pleasure yachts of 300 GT and above not engaged in trade and cargo ships of 300 GT and above but below 500 GT, operating in polar waters.The amendments are expected to enter into force on 1 January 2026.STCW Convention amendments related to electronic certificates MSC adopted amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, regulation I/2 (Certificates and endorsements), and the corresponding section of the Seafarers' Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) Code, related to electronic certificates. International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code amendments MSC adopted the latest set of amendments to the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code, following finalization by the Editorial & Technical Group. As usual, these amendments were adopted in the form of a consolidated version of the whole IMSBC Code and will enter into force on 1 January 2025, with voluntary application from 1 January 2024.The MSC also approved related circulars on: Guidelines for the submission of information and completion of the format for the properties of cargoes not listed in the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and their conditions of carriage; Guidelines for developing and approving procedures for sampling, testing and controlling the moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation; and Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective.2. A MASS Working Group was established to progress the work on the MASS Code and to identify issues that are relevant to instruments under the purview of the Legal and Facilitation Committee, to be considered by the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS, which was established as a cross-cutting mechanism to address common issues identified by the regulatory scoping exercises for the use of MASS conducted by the Maritime Safety, Legal and Facilitation Committees.The MSC noted, in particular, the common position of the Group on training, certification and competency requirements, namely that: 1. The MSC, after noting the progress made in developing the draft goal-based non-mandatory MASS Code, approved the updated road map for the further work.The Correspondence Group was re-established to, inter alia: continue the development of the non-mandatory goal-based MASS Code; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the Regulatory Scoping Exercise (RSE) (MSC.1/Circ.1638, section 5), focusing on the high priority items; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Correspondence Group Coordinator will report orally to the Intersessional MASS Working Group (MASS ISWG), which will meet in October 2023.The MASS ISWG was instructed by the Committee to continue the development of the MASS Code, taking into account the latest draft prepared by the Correspondence Group; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the RSE; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The Working Group on Goal-based New Ship Construction Standards (GBS) considered examples of functional requirements (FRs) for the MASS Code and provided some observations and recommendations for the MASS Working Group, in particular, that an appropriate hazard identification (HAZID) study should be conducted to provide the necessary tool for identifying relevant hazards, mitigating functions, and expected performances (EPs) and associated funcitonal requirements (FRs).The Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS has developed a table – intended as a living document – to identify preferred options for addressing common issues, such as the role, responsibilities competencies required of the master and crew for MASS; and identification and meaning of term ""remote operator"" and their responsibilities. Draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpointThe MSC approved draft amendments to SOLAS regulation II-2/4 related to oil fuel parameters other than flashpoint, with a view for subsequent adoption. A new generic provision is added after existing paragraph 2.1.8: ""Oil fuel delivered to and used on board ships shall not jeopardize the safety of ships or adversely affect the performance of the machinery or be harmful to personnel.""Guidelines for safety of ships using LPG MSC approved Interim Guidelines for the safety of ships using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).The basic philosophy of these Interim Guidelines is to provide provisions for the arrangement, installation, control and monitoring of machinery, equipment and systems using LPG as fuel to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and the environment, having regard to the nature of the fuels involved.The guidelines were developed by the CCC Sub-Committee, as part of the important work being carried out by the Sub-Committee in the context of shipping's need for new fuels and propulsion systems to meet decarbonization ambitions set out in the Initial IMO GHG Strategy.Matters related to innovative types of fuel are considered under the CCC agenda item on the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code) and development of guidelines for alternative fuels and related technologies. Interim guidelines for ships using fuel cells were approved by MSC 105 in April 2022 (MSC.1/Circ.1647).Safe operation of onshore power supply service – interim guidelines approvedThe MSC approved Interim guidelines on safe operation of onshore power supply service in port for ships engaged on international voyages.New output on safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels The MSC considered proposals for a new output to deliver a framework for the safe operation of new technologies and alternative fuels aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, to support the safe delivery of IMO's GHG Strategy.Having noted the overwhelming support for the proposal, the MSC agreed to new output on ""Development of a safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels"", to be added to the MSC agenda, starting with MSC 108. STCW training provisions on bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) approved MSC approved, for subsequent adoption at MSC 108, draft amendments to the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Code, to prevent and respond to bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH). Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain – draft Assembly resolution approved MSC approved a draft Assembly resolution on Recommendations emanating from the Joint Action Group to review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's transport workers and the global supply chain (JAG-TSC).The draft resolution endorses and recommends a number of actions to address the impact of measures taken during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEICs) affecting transport sectors and their workers, and to encourage improved coordination at the national level within affected countries. Other mattersFollowing work in the Sub-Committees, and consideration of their reports, MSC 107:Adopted amendments to the 1979, 1989 and 2009 Codes for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU Codes) to prohibit materials which contain asbestos; approve a related unified interpretation, to clarify that existing materials stowed on board before 1 January 2024 are not prohibited from being retained on board but should not be installed unless they can be documented to be asbestos-free before use/installation; and approve draft new guidelines for maintenance and monitoring of materials containing asbestos on board MODUs.Adopted the 2023 Diving Code, which updates the Code of Safety for Diving systems (resolution A.831(19)) and the Guidelines and specifications for Hyperbaric Evacuation Systems (resolution A.692(17)) for ships of not less than 500 gross tonnage that have a diving system installed on or after 1 January 2024; and approved, for future adoption, amendments to the IGF Code, including those related to pressure relief system and provide requirements for ships constructed after 1 January 2026.Approved, for future adoption, amendments to the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (Grain Code), introducing a new class of loading conditions for ""specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed"" and specify the requirements under which grain may be carried in such compartments.

Safety of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches

MSC adopted a new SOLAS regulation II-1/3-13 that covers requirements for the application, design and construction, operation, inspection, testing and maintenance of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches. MSC adopted a first set of amendments to the Polar Code, together with associated amendments to the SOLAS Convention, to incorporate new requirements concerning safety of navigation and voyage planning, applicable to fishing vessels of 24 m in length overall and above, pleasure yachts of 300 GT and above not engaged in trade and cargo ships of 300 GT and above but below 500 GT, operating in polar waters. MSC adopted amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, regulation I/2 (Certificates and endorsements), and the corresponding section of the Seafarers' Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) Code, related to electronic certificates. The MSC also approved related circulars on: Guidelines for the submission of information and completion of the format for the properties of cargoes not listed in the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and their conditions of carriage; Guidelines for developing and approving procedures for sampling, testing and controlling the moisture content for solid bulk cargoes which may liquefy or undergo dynamic separation; and Lists of solid bulk cargoes for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system may be exempted or for which a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system is ineffective. A MASS Working Group was established to progress the work on the MASS Code and to identify issues that are relevant to instruments under the purview of the Legal and Facilitation Committee, to be considered by the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS, which was established as a cross-cutting mechanism to address common issues identified by the regulatory scoping exercises for the use of MASS conducted by the Maritime Safety, Legal and Facilitation Committees. The Correspondence Group was re-established to, inter alia: continue the development of the non-mandatory goal-based MASS Code; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the Regulatory Scoping Exercise (RSE) (MSC.1/Circ.1638, section 5), focusing on the high priority items; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. The MASS ISWG was instructed by the Committee to continue the development of the MASS Code, taking into account the latest draft prepared by the Correspondence Group; consider the common potential gaps and/or themes identified during the RSE; develop positions on any common issues for submission to the Joint MSC/LEG/FAL Working Group on MASS; limit the development of the non-mandatory MASS Code to cargo ships with a view to consider the feasibility for application to passenger ships at a future stage. A new generic provision is added after existing paragraph 2.1.8: ""Oil fuel delivered to and used on board ships shall not jeopardize the safety of ships or adversely affect the performance of the machinery or be harmful to personnel.""

MSC approved Interim Guidelines for the safety of ships using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Matters related to innovative types of fuel are considered under the CCC agenda item on the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-flashpoint Fuels (IGF Code) and development of guidelines for alternative fuels and related technologies. MSC approved, for subsequent adoption at MSC 108, draft amendments to the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Code, to prevent and respond to bullying and harassment in the maritime sector, including sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH). It included representatives of ICAO, ILO, IMO, WHO, as well as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the International Road Transport Union (IRU) and the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF)

Apart from those mentioned above, following discussion on the work programme, MSC agreed to include, among others:

Revision of the Guidelines on Maritime Cyber Risk Management (MSC-FAL.1/Circ.3/Rev.2);

Comprehensive review of the Requirements for maintenance, thorough examination, operational testing, overhaul and repair of lifeboats and rescue boats, launching appliances and release gear (resolution MSC.402(96));

Revision of appendices A and B of the Revised guidance on shipboard towing and mooring equipment (MSC.1/Circ.1175/Rev.1)

Following work in the Sub-Committees, and consideration of their reports, MSC 107:

Adopted amendments to the 1979, 1989 and 2009 Codes for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU Codes) to prohibit materials which contain asbestos; approve a related unified interpretation, to clarify that existing materials stowed on board before 1 January 2024 are not prohibited from being retained on board but should not be installed unless they can be documented to be asbestos-free before use/installation; and approve draft new guidelines for maintenance and monitoring of materials containing asbestos on board MODUs. Adopted the 2023 Diving Code, which updates the Code of Safety for Diving systems (resolution A.831(19)) and the Guidelines and specifications for Hyperbaric Evacuation Systems (resolution A.692(17)) for ships of not less than 500 gross tonnage that have a diving system installed on or after 1 January 2024; and approved, for future adoption, amendments to the IGF Code, including those related to pressure relief system and provide requirements for ships constructed after 1 January 2026. Approved, for future adoption, amendments to the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (Grain Code), introducing a new class of loading conditions for ""specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed"" and specify the requirements under which grain may be carried in such compartments. Approved, for future adoption, draft amendments to the International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers, 2011 (ESP Code), relating to the procedures for approval and certification of a firm engaged in thickness measurement of hull structures contained in the Code, so as to permit Administrations to exercise the right of auditing a company conducting thickness measurement of hull structures. ***

Advice may be sought through the International Labour Organization (ILO), International Maritime Organization (IMO), International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) or International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), (see the ‘Related Links’ section for more details).Why Report an Abandonment Case?Timely reporting helps:•	Alert relevant authorities early;•	Prevent worsening of abandonment situations;•	Facilitate quick and effective resolutions for seafarers.Under the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, as amended, (MLC, 2006), abandoned seafarers are entitled to up to four months of unpaid wages and other contractual entitlements through compulsory insurance provided by shipowners.DisclaimerThis database follows the procedures established by the Joint ILO/IMO Ad Hoc Expert Working Group on Liability and Compensation Regarding Claims for Death, Personal Injury and Abandonment of Seafarers. In case no date of abandonment has been reported, the date of notification of the reporting organization is displayed as date of abandonment.The designations employed in this database, which are in conformity with United Nations practice, and the presentation of material therein do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the International Labour Office concerning the legal status of any country, area or territory or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers."

                            International Labour Office that it shall not enter into force for that
                            Member, or shall only enter into force at a later date upon subsequent

                        on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of
                        placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in
                        whole or in part, taking into account also the provisions of Article 45.Article 531. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this
                            Convention, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides: (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention
                                    shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this
                                    Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 49 above,
                                    if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into

                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every
                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been
                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall
                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the
                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of
                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that
                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall

                            conducive to ensuring a healthy environment. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in
                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers
                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of
                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped
                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be
                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to
                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and
                            climates. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,
                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum
                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space
                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5
                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied
                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the
                            fishers.Persons per sleeping room40. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping
                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no
                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 61, the
                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that there shall be
                            provided at least one tub or shower or both and one washbasin for every
                            six persons or fewer, and at least one toilet for every eight persons or
                            fewer, where the competent authority is satisfied that this is
                            reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the fishers.Laundry facilities63. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, adequate
                            facilities for washing, drying and ironing clothes shall be provided in
                            a compartment separate from sleeping rooms, mess rooms and toilets, and
                            shall be adequately ventilated, heated and equipped with lines or other
                            means for drying clothes.Facilities for sick and injured fishers66. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall require frequent inspections to be carried
                            out, by or under the authority of the skipper, to ensure that: (a) accommodation is clean, decently habitable and safe, and is
                                    maintained in a good state of repair;(b) food and water supplies are sufficient; and(c) galley and food storage spaces and equipment are hygienic
                                    and in a proper state of repair.The results of such inspections, and the actions taken to address any
                    deficiencies found, shall be recorded and available for review.Variations84. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit
                            derogations from the provisions in this Annex to take into account,
                            without discrimination, the interests of fishers having differing and
                            distinctive religious and social practices, on condition that such
                            derogations do not result in overall conditions less favourable than
                            those which would result from the application of this Annex.See related

                            International Labour Office that it shall not enter into force for that
                            Member, or shall only enter into force at a later date upon subsequent

                        International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report
                        on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of
                        placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in
                        whole or in part, taking into account also the provisions of Article 45.Article 531. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this
                            Convention, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides: (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention
                                    shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this
                                    Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 49 above,
                                    if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into

                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and
                            climates. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,
                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum

                            six persons or fewer, and at least one toilet for every eight persons or
                            fewer, where the competent authority is satisfied that this is
                            reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the fishers.Laundry facilities63. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, adequate
                            facilities for washing, drying and ironing clothes shall be provided in
                            a compartment separate from sleeping rooms, mess rooms and toilets, and

                    deficiencies found, shall be recorded and available for review.Variations84. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit
                            derogations from the provisions in this Annex to take into account,
                            without discrimination, the interests of fishers having differing and
                            distinctive religious and social practices, on condition that such
                            derogations do not result in overall conditions less favourable than
                            those which would result from the application of this Annex.See related

                                        requirement for fishers who have demonstrated equivalent
                                        knowledge and experience; and(c) ensure that fishers are sufficiently and reasonably
                                        familiarized with equipment and its methods of operation,

                        working conditions.2. If a Member, in whose port a fishing vessel calls in the
                            normal course of its business or for operational reasons, receives a
                            complaint or obtains evidence that such vessel does not conform to the
                            requirements of this Convention, it may prepare a report addressed to
                            the government of the flag State of the vessel, with a copy to the
                            Director-General of the International Labour Office, and may take
                            measures necessary to rectify any conditions on board which are clearly
                            hazardous to safety or health.3. This Article does not apply to complaints which a Member
                            considers to be manifestly unfounded.Article 44Each Member shall apply this Convention in such a way as to ensure that the
                        fishing vessels flying the flag of any State that has not ratified this
                        Convention do not receive more favourable treatment than fishing vessels
                        that fly the flag of any Member that has ratified it.Part VIII. Any amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 of
                            this Article shall enter into force six months after the date of its
                            adoption for any Member that has ratified this Convention, unless such
                            Member has given written notice to the Director-General of the
                            International Labour Office that it shall not enter into force for that
                            Member, or shall only enter into force at a later date upon subsequent
                            written notification.Part IX. When notifying the Members of the Organization of the
                            registration of the last of the ratifications required to bring the
                            Convention into force, the Director-General shall draw the attention of
                            the Members of the Organization to the date upon which the Convention
                            will come into force.Article 51The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to
                        the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance

                        all ratifications, declarations and denunciations registered by the
                        Director-General.Article 52At such times as it may consider necessary, the Governing Body of the
                        International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report
                        on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of
                        placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in
                        whole or in part, taking into account also the provisions of Article 45.Article 531. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this
                            Convention, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides: (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention
                                    shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this
                                    Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 49 above,
                                    if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into
                                    force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into
                                    force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by
                                    the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its
                            actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but
                            have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 54The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally
                        authoritative.Annex IEquivalence in measurementFor the purpose of this Convention, where the competent authority, after

                            without discrimination, the interests of fishers having differing and
                            distinctive religious and social practices, on condition that such
                            derogations do not result in overall conditions less favourable than
                            those which would result from the application of this Annex.See related

                                        specific hazards and risks on the fishing vessel concerned;
                                        and(b) require that fishing vessel owners, skippers, fishers

                                        competent authority may grant written exemptions from this
                                        requirement for fishers who have demonstrated equivalent
                                        knowledge and experience; and(c) ensure that fishers are sufficiently and reasonably
                                        familiarized with equipment and its methods of operation,
                                        including relevant safety measures, prior to using the
                                        equipment or participating in the operations concerned.Article 33Risk evaluation in relation to fishing shall be conducted, as
                            appropriate, with the participation of fishers or their

                                protection for fishers, taking into account the principle of
                                equality of treatment irrespective of nationality; and(b) to ensure the maintenance of social security rights which have
                                been acquired or are in the course of acquisition by all fishers

                            and 36, Members may determine, through bilateral and multilateral
                            agreements and through provisions adopted in the framework of regional

                            security legislation to which fishers are subject.Protection in the case of work-related sickness, injury or deathArticle 381. In the absence of national provisions for fishers, each
                            Member shall adopt laws, regulations or other measures to ensure that
                            fishing vessel owners are responsible for the provision to fishers on

                                    outer edge of its continental shelf, whichever distance from the
                                    coastline is greater,carry a valid document issued by the competent authority stating that the
                        vessel has been inspected by the competent authority or on its behalf, for
                        compliance with the provisions of this Convention concerning living and
                        working conditions.2. If a Member, in whose port a fishing vessel calls in the
                            normal course of its business or for operational reasons, receives a
                            complaint or obtains evidence that such vessel does not conform to the
                            requirements of this Convention, it may prepare a report addressed to
                            the government of the flag State of the vessel, with a copy to the
                            Director-General of the International Labour Office, and may take
                            measures necessary to rectify any conditions on board which are clearly
                            hazardous to safety or health.3. This Article does not apply to complaints which a Member
                            considers to be manifestly unfounded.Article 44Each Member shall apply this Convention in such a way as to ensure that the
                        fishing vessels flying the flag of any State that has not ratified this
                        Convention do not receive more favourable treatment than fishing vessels
                        that fly the flag of any Member that has ratified it.Part VIII. Any amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 of
                            this Article shall enter into force six months after the date of its
                            adoption for any Member that has ratified this Convention, unless such
                            Member has given written notice to the Director-General of the
                            International Labour Office that it shall not enter into force for that
                            Member, or shall only enter into force at a later date upon subsequent
                            written notification.Part IX. When notifying the Members of the Organization of the
                            registration of the last of the ratifications required to bring the
                            Convention into force, the Director-General shall draw the attention of
                            the Members of the Organization to the date upon which the Convention
                            will come into force.Article 51The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to
                        the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance

                        all ratifications, declarations and denunciations registered by the
                        Director-General.Article 52At such times as it may consider necessary, the Governing Body of the
                        International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report
                        on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of
                        placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in
                        whole or in part, taking into account also the provisions of Article 45.Article 531. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this
                            Convention, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides: (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention
                                    shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this
                                    Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 49 above,
                                    if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into
                                    force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into
                                    force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by
                                    the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its
                            actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but
                            have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 54The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally
                        authoritative.Annex IEquivalence in measurementFor the purpose of this Convention, where the competent authority, after
                    consultation, decides to use length overall (LOA) rather than length (L) as the
                    basis of measurement:(a) a length overall (LOA) of 16.5 metres shall be considered equivalent
                            to a length (L) of 15 metres;(b) a length overall (LOA) of 26.5 metres shall be considered equivalent

                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers
                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of
                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped
                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be
                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to
                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and
                            climates. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,

                            distinctive religious and social practices, on condition that such
                            derogations do not result in overall conditions less favourable than
                            those which would result from the application of this Annex.See related

                            complaint or obtains evidence that such vessel does not conform to the
                            requirements of this Convention, it may prepare a report addressed to
                            the government of the flag State of the vessel, with a copy to the
                            Director-General of the International Labour Office, and may take

                            hazardous to safety or health.3. This Article does not apply to complaints which a Member
                            considers to be manifestly unfounded.Article 44Each Member shall apply this Convention in such a way as to ensure that the
                        fishing vessels flying the flag of any State that has not ratified this
                        Convention do not receive more favourable treatment than fishing vessels
                        that fly the flag of any Member that has ratified it.Part VIII. Any amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 of
                            this Article shall enter into force six months after the date of its
                            adoption for any Member that has ratified this Convention, unless such
                            Member has given written notice to the Director-General of the
                            International Labour Office that it shall not enter into force for that
                            Member, or shall only enter into force at a later date upon subsequent
                            written notification.Part IX. When notifying the Members of the Organization of the
                            registration of the last of the ratifications required to bring the
                            Convention into force, the Director-General shall draw the attention of
                            the Members of the Organization to the date upon which the Convention
                            will come into force.Article 51The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to
                        the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance

                        all ratifications, declarations and denunciations registered by the
                        Director-General.Article 52At such times as it may consider necessary, the Governing Body of the
                        International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report
                        on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of
                        placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in
                        whole or in part, taking into account also the provisions of Article 45.Article 531. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this
                            Convention, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides: (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention
                                    shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this
                                    Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 49 above,
                                    if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into

                                    force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by
                                    the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its
                            actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but
                            have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 54The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally
                        authoritative.Annex IEquivalence in measurementFor the purpose of this Convention, where the competent authority, after

                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require
                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in
                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every
                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been
                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall
                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the

                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the
                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external
                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved
                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in
                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers
                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of
                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped
                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be
                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to
                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and
                            climates. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,
                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum
                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space
                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5
                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied
                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the
                            fishers.Persons per sleeping room40. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping
                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no
                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 61, the

                            provided at least one tub or shower or both and one washbasin for every
                            six persons or fewer, and at least one toilet for every eight persons or
                            fewer, where the competent authority is satisfied that this is
                            reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the fishers.Laundry facilities63. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, adequate
                            facilities for washing, drying and ironing clothes shall be provided in
                            a compartment separate from sleeping rooms, mess rooms and toilets, and
                            shall be adequately ventilated, heated and equipped with lines or other
                            means for drying clothes.Facilities for sick and injured fishers66. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall require frequent inspections to be carried
                            out, by or under the authority of the skipper, to ensure that: (a) accommodation is clean, decently habitable and safe, and is
                                    maintained in a good state of repair;(b) food and water supplies are sufficient; and(c) galley and food storage spaces and equipment are hygienic
                                    and in a proper state of repair.The results of such inspections, and the actions taken to address any
                    deficiencies found, shall be recorded and available for review.Variations84. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit
                            derogations from the provisions in this Annex to take into account,

                                    outer edge of its continental shelf, whichever distance from the
                                    coastline is greater,carry a valid document issued by the competent authority stating that the
                        vessel has been inspected by the competent authority or on its behalf, for
                        compliance with the provisions of this Convention concerning living and
                        working conditions.2. If a Member, in whose port a fishing vessel calls in the
                            normal course of its business or for operational reasons, receives a
                            complaint or obtains evidence that such vessel does not conform to the
                            requirements of this Convention, it may prepare a report addressed to
                            the government of the flag State of the vessel, with a copy to the
                            Director-General of the International Labour Office, and may take
                            measures necessary to rectify any conditions on board which are clearly
                            hazardous to safety or health.3. This Article does not apply to complaints which a Member
                            considers to be manifestly unfounded.Article 44Each Member shall apply this Convention in such a way as to ensure that the
                        fishing vessels flying the flag of any State that has not ratified this
                        Convention do not receive more favourable treatment than fishing vessels
                        that fly the flag of any Member that has ratified it.Part VIII. Any amendment adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 of
                            this Article shall enter into force six months after the date of its
                            adoption for any Member that has ratified this Convention, unless such
                            Member has given written notice to the Director-General of the
                            International Labour Office that it shall not enter into force for that
                            Member, or shall only enter into force at a later date upon subsequent
                            written notification.Part IX. When notifying the Members of the Organization of the
                            registration of the last of the ratifications required to bring the
                            Convention into force, the Director-General shall draw the attention of
                            the Members of the Organization to the date upon which the Convention
                            will come into force.Article 51The Director-General of the International Labour Office shall communicate to
                        the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance
                        with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations full particulars of
                        all ratifications, declarations and denunciations registered by the
                        Director-General.Article 52At such times as it may consider necessary, the Governing Body of the
                        International Labour Office shall present to the General Conference a report
                        on the working of this Convention and shall examine the desirability of
                        placing on the agenda of the Conference the question of its revision in
                        whole or in part, taking into account also the provisions of Article 45.Article 531. Should the Conference adopt a new Convention revising this
                            Convention, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides: (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention
                                    shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this
                                    Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 49 above,
                                    if and when the new revising Convention shall have come into
                                    force;(b) as from the date when the new revising Convention comes into
                                    force this Convention shall cease to be open to ratification by
                                    the Members.2. This Convention shall in any case remain in force in its
                            actual form and content for those Members which have ratified it but
                            have not ratified the revising Convention.Article 54The English and French versions of the text of this Convention are equally
                        authoritative.Annex IEquivalence in measurementFor the purpose of this Convention, where the competent authority, after
                    consultation, decides to use length overall (LOA) rather than length (L) as the
                    basis of measurement:(a) a length overall (LOA) of 16.5 metres shall be considered equivalent

                            practicable, require compliance with this Annex when the crew
                            accommodation of a vessel is substantially altered and, for a vessel
                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require
                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in
                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every
                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been
                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall
                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the
                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of
                            the Member, for compliance with those requirements of this Annex that
                            are applicable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, there shall
                            be no direct openings, except for the purpose of emergency escape, into

                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the
                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external
                            bulkheads shall be efficiently constructed of steel or another approved
                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in
                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers
                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of
                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped
                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be
                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to
                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and
                            climates. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,
                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum
                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space
                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5
                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied
                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the
                            fishers.Persons per sleeping room40. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping
                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no
                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 61, the
                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that there shall be
                            provided at least one tub or shower or both and one washbasin for every
                            six persons or fewer, and at least one toilet for every eight persons or
                            fewer, where the competent authority is satisfied that this is
                            reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the fishers.Laundry facilities63. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, adequate
                            facilities for washing, drying and ironing clothes shall be provided in
                            a compartment separate from sleeping rooms, mess rooms and toilets, and
                            shall be adequately ventilated, heated and equipped with lines or other
                            means for drying clothes.Facilities for sick and injured fishers66. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall require frequent inspections to be carried
                            out, by or under the authority of the skipper, to ensure that: (a) accommodation is clean, decently habitable and safe, and is
                                    maintained in a good state of repair;(b) food and water supplies are sufficient; and(c) galley and food storage spaces and equipment are hygienic
                                    and in a proper state of repair.The results of such inspections, and the actions taken to address any
                    deficiencies found, shall be recorded and available for review.Variations84. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit
                            derogations from the provisions in this Annex to take into account,
                            without discrimination, the interests of fishers having differing and
                            distinctive religious and social practices, on condition that such
                            derogations do not result in overall conditions less favourable than
                            those which would result from the application of this Annex.See related

                            that changes the flag it flies to the flag of the Member, require
                            compliance with those requirements of this Annex that are applicable in
                            accordance with paragraph 2 of this Annex.10. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, on every
                            occasion when the crew accommodation of the fishing vessel has been
                            reconstructed or substantially altered, the competent authority shall
                            inspect the accommodation for compliance with the requirements of the
                            Convention, and when the vessel changes the flag it flies to the flag of

                            storerooms, drying rooms or communal sanitary areas; that part of the
                            bulkhead separating such places from sleeping rooms and external

                            material and shall be watertight and gas-tight. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall adopt standards for noise and vibration in
                            accommodation spaces which shall ensure adequate protection to fishers
                            from the effects of such noise and vibration, including the effects of
                            noise- and vibration-induced fatigue.Ventilation23. Vessels of 24 metres in length and over shall be equipped
                            with a system of ventilation for accommodation, which shall be
                            controlled so as to maintain the air in a satisfactory condition and to
                            ensure sufficiency of air movement in all weather conditions and
                            climates. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 37 and 38,
                            the competent authority may, after consultation, decide that the minimum
                            permitted floor area per person of sleeping rooms, excluding space
                            occupied by berths and lockers, shall not be less than 1.0 and 1.5
                            square metres respectively, where the competent authority is satisfied
                            that this is reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the
                            fishers.Persons per sleeping room40. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, sleeping
                            rooms for officers shall be for one person wherever possible and in no
                            case shall the sleeping room contain more than two berths. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 61, the
                            competent authority may, after consultation, decide that there shall be
                            provided at least one tub or shower or both and one washbasin for every
                            six persons or fewer, and at least one toilet for every eight persons or
                            fewer, where the competent authority is satisfied that this is
                            reasonable and will not result in discomfort to the fishers.Laundry facilities63. For vessels of 45 metres in length and over, adequate
                            facilities for washing, drying and ironing clothes shall be provided in
                            a compartment separate from sleeping rooms, mess rooms and toilets, and
                            shall be adequately ventilated, heated and equipped with lines or other
                            means for drying clothes.Facilities for sick and injured fishers66. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall require frequent inspections to be carried
                            out, by or under the authority of the skipper, to ensure that: (a) accommodation is clean, decently habitable and safe, and is
                                    maintained in a good state of repair;(b) food and water supplies are sufficient; and(c) galley and food storage spaces and equipment are hygienic
                                    and in a proper state of repair.The results of such inspections, and the actions taken to address any
                    deficiencies found, shall be recorded and available for review.Variations84. The competent authority, after consultation, may permit
                            derogations from the provisions in this Annex to take into account,
                            without discrimination, the interests of fishers having differing and
                            distinctive religious and social practices, on condition that such
                            derogations do not result in overall conditions less favourable than
                            those which would result from the application of this Annex.See related

                                other measures: (a) prohibit recruitment and placement services from using
                                        means, mechanisms or lists intended to prevent or deter
                                        fishers from engaging for work;(b) require that no fees or other charges for recruitment or
                                        placement of fishers be borne directly or indirectly, in

                            Convention, then, unless the new Convention otherwise provides: (a) the ratification by a Member of the new revising Convention
                                    shall ipso jure involve the immediate denunciation of this

                            provided at least one tub or shower or both and one washbasin for every
                            six persons or fewer, and at least one toilet for every eight persons or
                            fewer, where the competent authority is satisfied that this is

                            facilities for washing, drying and ironing clothes shall be provided in
                            a compartment separate from sleeping rooms, mess rooms and toilets, and
                            shall be adequately ventilated, heated and equipped with lines or other
                            means for drying clothes. For vessels of 24 metres in length and over, the
                            competent authority shall require frequent inspections to be carried
                            out, by or under the authority of the skipper, to ensure that: (a) accommodation is clean, decently habitable and safe, and is

The Resolution specifically calls on States to refrain from any form of jamming or spoofing affecting civil aviation and to coordinate with air navigation service providers when military or security operations might affect civil aviation operations.
