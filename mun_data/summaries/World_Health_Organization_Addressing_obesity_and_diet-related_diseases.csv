The ROOTS of Obesity

























People with obesity are constantly shamed and blamed for their disease. Our policy priorities
The roots of Obesity
To have a real impact on obesity, we need to work together to address its many root causes throughout society. Read more















                                Healthcare Access
                            
Without access to trained providers, most people who suffer from Obesity won’t reach and maintain a healthy long-term weight goal. Read more















                                Marketing
                            
There is a complex relationship between food systems and health, with marketing of foodstuffs having a known link to obesity. Read more















                                Mental Health
                            
Symptoms of some mental health disorders, and their associated medications, can lead to weight gain. Read more















                                Stigma
                            
Weight discrimination and stigma can have significant consequences on somebody with obesity. Read More 




















Healthcare Access
Without access to trained providers, most people who suffer from Obesity won’t reach and maintain a healthy long-term weight goal. In almost all high income countries, people who suffer from the chronic disease of obesity must be provided with affordable and reimbursable access to specialised healthcare providers who can treat the disease with individualized treatment approaches of diet, anti-obesity medication, behavior and exercise options that are unique to the individual; in some cases that may also include surgical intervention. Obesity is a complex, chronic disease with many contributing factors that challenge primary care and obesity medicine specialists alike, but without access to properly trained specialty providers, most people who suffer from Obesity will not be able to reach and maintain a healthy long-term weight goal. Access to healthcare in itself can be challenging based on geographic clinician shortages, transportation barriers, insurance coverage and the lack of trained obesity medicine specialists, especially since most Medical School programs do not offer specialized Obesity care curriculum yet. The general lack of awareness that obesity is indeed a disease within the medical community at large, and the public’s belief that obesity is the result of a lifestyle choice and not a disease, creates an additional barrier to treatment. A recent study of obesity in health systems in more than 60 countries found that most lack adequate services to tackle obesity. Respondents in 47% of the countries stated that there were difficulties obtaining referrals for obesity treatment, while a lack of treatment options and clear pathways to treatment were mentioned as problems, especially in lower-income countries. When it comes to the complex treatment of obesity, we must focus on disease awareness, specialty clinician availability, early diagnosis and access to specialty care for all life stages from pediatric patients to senior adults. Long term access to specialized obesity medicine care is key to the success in treating obesity. Read More 




















Marketing
There is a complex relationship between food systems and health, with marketing of foodstuffs having a known link to obesity. Read More 




















Mental Health
Symptoms of some mental health disorders, and their associated medications, can lead to weight gain. Specifically, when it comes to obesity, a lack of sleep can disrupt hormones such as increased cortisol (a stress hormone linked to weight gain) and increased ghrelin (a hormone that stimulates appetite and cravings), and decreased leptin (a hormone that tells your brain when you are full). Read More 




















Stigma
Weight discrimination and stigma can have significant consequences on somebody with obesity. Obesity stigma are deeply ingrained social stereotypes associated with obesity and people affected by obesity. Obesity stigma can increase risk for obesity (e.g. increased stress hormones that promote weight gain, behaviours that promote weight gain such as avoiding health promoting environments for fear of being shame and blamed for one’s weight). Obesity stigma can also have social and economic consequences for individuals living with obesity, such as fewer opportunities for education and employment. Internalized weight bias, or self-directed bias, is the extent to which individuals living with obesity endorse negative weight-biased beliefs about themselves and can impact health and obesity management outcomes.

Healthcare Access
Without access to trained providers, most people who suffer from Obesity won’t reach and maintain a healthy long-term weight goal. In almost all high income countries, people who suffer from the chronic disease of obesity must be provided with affordable and reimbursable access to specialised healthcare providers who can treat the disease with individualized treatment approaches of diet, anti-obesity medication, behavior and exercise options that are unique to the individual; in some cases that may also include surgical intervention. Obesity is a complex, chronic disease with many contributing factors that challenge primary care and obesity medicine specialists alike, but without access to properly trained specialty providers, most people who suffer from Obesity will not be able to reach and maintain a healthy long-term weight goal. Access to healthcare in itself can be challenging based on geographic clinician shortages, transportation barriers, insurance coverage and the lack of trained obesity medicine specialists, especially since most Medical School programs do not offer specialized Obesity care curriculum yet. The general lack of awareness that obesity is indeed a disease within the medical community at large, and the public’s belief that obesity is the result of a lifestyle choice and not a disease, creates an additional barrier to treatment. A recent study of obesity in health systems in more than 60 countries found that most lack adequate services to tackle obesity. Respondents in 47% of the countries stated that there were difficulties obtaining referrals for obesity treatment, while a lack of treatment options and clear pathways to treatment were mentioned as problems, especially in lower-income countries. When it comes to the complex treatment of obesity, we must focus on disease awareness, specialty clinician availability, early diagnosis and access to specialty care for all life stages from pediatric patients to senior adults. Long term access to specialized obesity medicine care is key to the success in treating obesity. Read More

Obesity stigma are deeply ingrained social stereotypes associated with obesity and people affected by obesity. Obesity stigma can increase risk for obesity (e.g. increased stress hormones that promote weight gain, behaviours that promote weight gain such as avoiding health promoting environments for fear of being shame and blamed for one’s weight). Obesity stigma can also have social and economic consequences for individuals living with obesity, such as fewer opportunities for education and employment. Internalized weight bias, or self-directed bias, is the extent to which individuals living with obesity endorse negative weight-biased beliefs about themselves and can impact health and obesity management outcomes.
