Gaza: The long road home


        With the implementation of a ceasefire agreement, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have begun a journey back to their homes – or what is left of them
      


Israel and the occupied territories
Protected persons: Internally displaced persons












Ahmed Al Waheidi/ICRC




Many are now seeing for themselves the significant parts of the Gaza Strip that have been left in ruins: gaping holes, destroyed homes and piles of rubble that have made neighborhoods unrecognizable. Ahmed Al Waheidi/ICRC








For those walking long distances to get back to the north, it is not always possible to take even the tarpaulin or plastic they used against the elements, because they need to prioritize carrying children or elderly relatives. People seek out shelter among the collapsing buildings where the risk of unexploded ordnance, although an ever-present threat, is deprioritized for more immediate needs like shelter from the elements, food and water. Ahmed Al Waheidi/ICRC








Having faced immense struggles just to meet their most basic needs for more than a year, they now return to homes without rooves, without their things, and with limited access to food, water, and health care. The ICRC is continuing to deliver life-saving and essential assistance to help meet the needs and curb the suffering of the people of Gaza following this prolonged conflict, with a focus on those who have been made most vulnerable by the hostilities. Ahmed Al Waheidi/ICRC

        Frequently asked questions
              







      
      What specific problem does the ICRC's Health Care in Danger project address? And yet it frequently goes unrecognized.An ICRC study based on data collected in 16 countries from mid-2008 to the end of 2010 shows patterns of violence that hinder the delivery of health care, ranging from direct attacks on patients and on medical personnel and facilities – including looting and kidnapping – to arrests and denial of access to health care. Although acts that hinder the delivery of health care often violate basic principles of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and although numerous efforts have been undertaken by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement over decades to put an end to these acts, the problem nonetheless continues. The effect on the wounded and sick of just one violent incident directed against medical personnel or facilities may be felt by hundreds or even thousands of people.Owing to the effects of chronic and acute threats, compounded by the persistent problem of inadequate medical services, lack of access to health care is probably one of the biggest humanitarian issues today in terms of the numbers of people affected. It includes:

first-aid posts and ambulances;
health care centres;
hospitals, clinics, and physical rehabilitation centres; 
health-care personnel, whether working in medical facilities, in ambulances or as independent practitioners;
all persons on the premises of medical facilities, including the wounded and sick and their relatives;
Red Cross and Red Crescent staff involved in the delivery of health care, including volunteers;
health-oriented NGOs;
military health-care facilities and personnel. Giving people affected by conflict and other violence access to essential health care

      What specific problem does the ICRC's Health Care in Danger project address? And yet it frequently goes unrecognized.An ICRC study based on data collected in 16 countries from mid-2008 to the end of 2010 shows patterns of violence that hinder the delivery of health care, ranging from direct attacks on patients and on medical personnel and facilities – including looting and kidnapping – to arrests and denial of access to health care. Although acts that hinder the delivery of health care often violate basic principles of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and although numerous efforts have been undertaken by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement over decades to put an end to these acts, the problem nonetheless continues. The effect on the wounded and sick of just one violent incident directed against medical personnel or facilities may be felt by hundreds or even thousands of people.Owing to the effects of chronic and acute threats, compounded by the persistent problem of inadequate medical services, lack of access to health care is probably one of the biggest humanitarian issues today in terms of the numbers of people affected. It includes:

first-aid posts and ambulances;
health care centres;
hospitals, clinics, and physical rehabilitation centres; 
health-care personnel, whether working in medical facilities, in ambulances or as independent practitioners;
all persons on the premises of medical facilities, including the wounded and sick and their relatives;
Red Cross and Red Crescent staff involved in the delivery of health care, including volunteers;
health-oriented NGOs;

Frequently asked questions
              







      
      What specific problem does the ICRC's Health Care in Danger project address? And yet it frequently goes unrecognized.An ICRC study based on data collected in 16 countries from mid-2008 to the end of 2010 shows patterns of violence that hinder the delivery of health care, ranging from direct attacks on patients and on medical personnel and facilities – including looting and kidnapping – to arrests and denial of access to health care. Although acts that hinder the delivery of health care often violate basic principles of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and although numerous efforts have been undertaken by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement over decades to put an end to these acts, the problem nonetheless continues. The effect on the wounded and sick of just one violent incident directed against medical personnel or facilities may be felt by hundreds or even thousands of people.Owing to the effects of chronic and acute threats, compounded by the persistent problem of inadequate medical services, lack of access to health care is probably one of the biggest humanitarian issues today in terms of the numbers of people affected. It includes:

first-aid posts and ambulances;
health care centres;
hospitals, clinics, and physical rehabilitation centres; 
health-care personnel, whether working in medical facilities, in ambulances or as independent practitioners;
all persons on the premises of medical facilities, including the wounded and sick and their relatives;
Red Cross and Red Crescent staff involved in the delivery of health care, including volunteers;
health-oriented NGOs;

Amir Mohammad/ICRC




In 2024, communities in Afghanistan continued to face significant challenges to access basic necessities such as healthcare, food and clean water. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) worked to respond to humanitarian challenges across Afghanistan by supporting healthcare, providing physical rehabilitation services, assisting people in establishing livelihoods and incomes, and improving access to clean water, sanitation and energy. As Afghanistan remained one of the most heavily weapon-contaminated countries in the world, our teams have worked alongside our Afghan Red Crescent Society partners to raise awareness of mine risks within communities and promote the right behaviors to adopt to stay safe. A look at the measurable impact of our work in 2024:


964,259 patients, (65 per cent women and children), received primary health care at 47 health facilities of the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) that are supported by the ICRC. English_ICRC_Afghanistan_Facts_and_Figures_2024.pdf

Devastating earthquake in Myanmar: ICRC responds to help people on the ground


        Providing medical supplies, access to clean water, critical supplies, and helping families keep in touch in the wake of disaster
      


Myanmar




Situation on the groundHow our teams are helpingDonate now












ICRC




Thousands of people have been confirmed dead, with many more injured, and countless others displaced or missing after a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on 28 March 2025. Reaching those in urgent need
Amid this devastation, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), together with the Myanmar Red Cross Society and Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement partners, is delivering life-saving support. This included:

Six emergency health kits, each capable of covering the medical needs of 10,000 people for three months
600 body bags for the dignified recovery and identification of the deceased
Support for Myanmar Red Cross emergency teams conducting search-and-rescue and first aid operations




Essential items for those helping on the front lines
After discussions with front liners and analyzing the situation on the ground, we have provided the following essential items to assist in their work:

Helmets and heavy duty gloves
Ropes, goggles, and items to assist in the search 
Stretchers to carry the wounded




Safe water, sanitation and disease prevention
Access to clean water is critical in any emergency. To reduce the risk of cholera and diarrhoea outbreaks, the ICRC and Myanmar Red Cross are:

Deploying water treatment units in Mandalay, Sagaing and Nay Pyi Taw to reach 2,500 people
Distributing chlorine tablets and repairing water systems
Training local staff to safely operate water treatment systems




Providing shelter and essential supplies
ICRC emergency stocks pre-positioned near the epicentre are now being mobilized to support communities left with nothing. Ko Mohamed Ahyup
  

      ICRC staff
  






















      Urgent help needed in Myanmar
  



      Following the devastating earthquake that has struck Myanmar and bordering regions, the scale of destruction is overwhelming — many are injured, displaced, or missing, with casualty numbers rising by the hour. Donate today

Philippines: Falling in love in… and for the Red Cross

Protection
Helping detainees

ICRC




It was a whirlwind, red-letter romance. Mariegen Sumaylo was then a 31-year-old field nurse for the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) in 1991 when she first met her colleague, Alfonsito “Fons” Balo, in Dumaguete City. “Alam mo ba Ate Mariegen, dalaga ka pa, at binata pa yan si Fons (You know Mariegen, you’re single, and Fons is still a bachelor),” they teased. Mariegen recalled that once Fons’ class was done, she would help him clean the area. These gestures of kindness would not go unnoticed: During Fons’ last week, he started wooing Mariegen. They decided to start dating even if they were aware that they would soon be separated, with Fons going to Davao and Mariegen heading for Cebu. ICRC






Mariegen and Fons, during a hike to Mount Batulao, pose on a mountain trail with lush green peaks in the background under a clear blue sky. Mariegen, who was then working on a programme jointly managed by the Philippine Red Cross with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), was home in Cebu only on weekends. He offered a solution to the couple’s problem: He asked Mariegen if she would consider working for the ICRC in Manila, so she and Fons could be together. Mariegen moved to the ICRC in 1993 also because she wanted to work with conflict-affected people. ICRC

In 2024, after 35 years of working for the Red Cross, Mariegen retired. Lorenzo ARADA/ICRC








On her final working day on the 19 December 2024, Mariegen visited the Laguna Provincial Jail to assist in the distribution of hygiene kits to over 700 detainees. “Our hope is that you would use this (hygiene kit) for your own good,” said Mariegen prior to giving away the kits. I just have to return my laptop and phone.”

It was a whirlwind, red-letter romance. Mariegen Sumaylo was then a 31-year-old field nurse for the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) in 1991 when she first met her colleague, Alfonsito “Fons” Balo, in Dumaguete City. “Alam mo ba Ate Mariegen, dalaga ka pa, at binata pa yan si Fons (You know Mariegen, you’re single, and Fons is still a bachelor),” they teased. Mariegen recalled that once Fons’ class was done, she would help him clean the area. These gestures of kindness would not go unnoticed: During Fons’ last week, he started wooing Mariegen. They decided to start dating even if they were aware that they would soon be separated, with Fons going to Davao and Mariegen heading for Cebu. ICRC






Mariegen and Fons, during a hike to Mount Batulao, pose on a mountain trail with lush green peaks in the background under a clear blue sky. Mariegen, who was then working on a programme jointly managed by the Philippine Red Cross with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), was home in Cebu only on weekends. He offered a solution to the couple’s problem: He asked Mariegen if she would consider working for the ICRC in Manila, so she and Fons could be together. Mariegen moved to the ICRC in 1993 also because she wanted to work with conflict-affected people. ICRC

On her final working day on the 19 December 2024, Mariegen visited the Laguna Provincial Jail to assist in the distribution of hygiene kits to over 700 detainees. “Our hope is that you would use this (hygiene kit) for your own good,” said Mariegen prior to giving away the kits. I just have to return my laptop and phone.”

Meeting the challenge of economic insecurity head-on



At the ICRC, we recognize that the hardships that civilians experience during armed conflict take them to the very limits of their coping mechanisms. We work to combat food insecurity and provide emergency relief and longer-term livelihood support to the people who need our help – particularly those in the grip of armed conflict or other crises. Preventing harm and reducing risks
Our economic security programmes are designed to reduce risks and protect people affected by armed conflict and other violence. Read more



Humanitarian aid
We work to provide immediate relief to people affected by conflict, ensuring they have safe access to food, shelter, medical assistance and other essential needs. Access to food in a crisis
We help people affected by food insecurity to access nutritious food, particularly those who have been displaced from their homes or who are living in areas that are difficult to access. This may include distributing food parcels, providing hot meals or supporting community kitchens, or providing financial assistance so that people can purchase food locally. Preventing and treating malnutrition
We seek to prevent malnutrition by working with communities to improve access to and the availability of nutritious food and optimizing nutrition practices, especially for the most vulnerable children, expecting and nursing women and people deprived of their liberty. Read more

Devastating earthquakes across Myanmar




The earthquake on 28 March has devastated communities across Myanmar, with thousands injured, displaced and unaccounted for, as well as extensive damage to buildings, roads and other facilities. Our teams are on the ground providing critical aid, including medical supplies, water treatment units, and shelter, and working with the Myanmar Red Cross Society to reconnect families who’ve become separated.

The complex issue of family separation and missing persons



The issue of family separation is multifaceted and intricate. Our experts work to reconnect families, carry out searches and consolidate information to provide news on the fate and whereabouts of missing persons and separated family members and address their needs on multiple levels. Restoring family links during emergencies
The ICRC, together with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Family Links Network, uses a number of tools to restore communication or keep family members in touch: free telephone or video calls, which are the quickest, most direct solution, and Red Cross messages (brief letters) that allow families to exchange news when calls are not possible and to which pictures and official documents can be attached. Field work on individual cases, data analysis, humanitarian dialogue with authorities and parties to a conflict, access to areas that are difficult to reach, forensic science, including work to identify the deceased, and new technologies are some of the ways we collect, consolidate and triangulate information to search for answers about the fate and whereabouts of missing people on behalf of their families. Producing online tools to help affected people
We produce online tools to assist families in their search for missing loved ones, such as Trace the Face, and for people on the move at risk of going missing during conflict, migration or humanitarian crises, such as RedSafe, a digital application that provides access to safe and secure information and services provided by the ICRC and our trusted partners.

Accompanying families
Often the primary actors in the search process, we support the families of missing people and accompany them as they learn to live with uncertainty in the long term should they not receive information about their missing loved ones. The CTA advisory arm: Red Cross and Red Crescent Missing Persons Centre
The Centre, set up in partnership with the Kenya Red Cross Society, the Australian Red Cross and the British Red Cross, supports the efforts of the authorities, the Movement and practitioners, including the families themselves, on the issue of separated, missing and deceased persons, through advocacy, research, technical support, capacity-building and knowledge development and exchange.

Missing persons and their families are protected by international humanitarian law in international and non-international armed conflicts and by international human rights law in both wartime and peacetime. Concrete actions include preventing family separation, providing information to families, ensuring proper management of the dead, strengthening medico-legal systems and establishing relevant mechanisms and structures, such as National Information Bureaux in international armed conflicts, in line with existing obligations under international law.

Helping people stay in touch

      Acting quickly during emergencies, helping families stay in touch with their loved ones, thereby preventing loss of contact and disappearances. Preventing such separations, locating missing people, reconnecting families and supporting them while they search for their loved ones has been at the heart of the ICRC’s work to relieve the suffering of those affected by conflict for more than 160 years, through the activities of its Central Tracing Agency. The Central Tracing Agency: Reuniting, reconnecting, resolving for 150 years
The Central Tracing Agency, founded in 1870, is at the heart of our efforts around the globe to protect and restore family links, to search for and identify missing persons, to protect the dignity of the dead and to ensure that the needs of missing people's families are addressed.

The complex issue of family separation and missing persons



The issue of family separation is multifaceted and intricate. Our experts work to reconnect families, carry out searches and consolidate information to provide news on the fate and whereabouts of missing persons and separated family members and address their needs on multiple levels. Restoring family links during emergencies
The ICRC, together with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Family Links Network, uses a number of tools to restore communication or keep family members in touch: free telephone or video calls, which are the quickest, most direct solution, and Red Cross messages (brief letters) that allow families to exchange news when calls are not possible and to which pictures and official documents can be attached. Field work on individual cases, data analysis, humanitarian dialogue with authorities and parties to a conflict, access to areas that are difficult to reach, forensic science, including work to identify the deceased, and new technologies are some of the ways we collect, consolidate and triangulate information to search for answers about the fate and whereabouts of missing people on behalf of their families. Producing online tools to help affected people
We produce online tools to assist families in their search for missing loved ones, such as Trace the Face, and for people on the move at risk of going missing during conflict, migration or humanitarian crises, such as RedSafe, a digital application that provides access to safe and secure information and services provided by the ICRC and our trusted partners.

The Centre, set up in partnership with the Kenya Red Cross Society, the Australian Red Cross and the British Red Cross, supports the efforts of the authorities, the Movement and practitioners, including the families themselves, on the issue of separated, missing and deceased persons, through advocacy, research, technical support, capacity-building and knowledge development and exchange.

The complex issue of family separation and missing persons



The issue of family separation is multifaceted and intricate. Our experts work to reconnect families, carry out searches and consolidate information to provide news on the fate and whereabouts of missing persons and separated family members and address their needs on multiple levels. Restoring family links during emergencies
The ICRC, together with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Family Links Network, uses a number of tools to restore communication or keep family members in touch: free telephone or video calls, which are the quickest, most direct solution, and Red Cross messages (brief letters) that allow families to exchange news when calls are not possible and to which pictures and official documents can be attached. Field work on individual cases, data analysis, humanitarian dialogue with authorities and parties to a conflict, access to areas that are difficult to reach, forensic science, including work to identify the deceased, and new technologies are some of the ways we collect, consolidate and triangulate information to search for answers about the fate and whereabouts of missing people on behalf of their families. Producing online tools to help affected people
We produce online tools to assist families in their search for missing loved ones, such as Trace the Face, and for people on the move at risk of going missing during conflict, migration or humanitarian crises, such as RedSafe, a digital application that provides access to safe and secure information and services provided by the ICRC and our trusted partners.

Accompanying families
Often the primary actors in the search process, we support the families of missing people and accompany them as they learn to live with uncertainty in the long term should they not receive information about their missing loved ones. The CTA advisory arm: Red Cross and Red Crescent Missing Persons Centre
The Centre, set up in partnership with the Kenya Red Cross Society, the Australian Red Cross and the British Red Cross, supports the efforts of the authorities, the Movement and practitioners, including the families themselves, on the issue of separated, missing and deceased persons, through advocacy, research, technical support, capacity-building and knowledge development and exchange.

The ICRC, together with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Family Links Network, uses a number of tools to restore communication or keep family members in touch: free telephone or video calls, which are the quickest, most direct solution, and Red Cross messages (brief letters) that allow families to exchange news when calls are not possible and to which pictures and official documents can be attached. Field work on individual cases, data analysis, humanitarian dialogue with authorities and parties to a conflict, access to areas that are difficult to reach, forensic science, including work to identify the deceased, and new technologies are some of the ways we collect, consolidate and triangulate information to search for answers about the fate and whereabouts of missing people on behalf of their families. Producing online tools to help affected people
We produce online tools to assist families in their search for missing loved ones, such as Trace the Face, and for people on the move at risk of going missing during conflict, migration or humanitarian crises, such as RedSafe, a digital application that provides access to safe and secure information and services provided by the ICRC and our trusted partners.
