The EU has announced it will impose trade “countermeasures” on up to €26bn (£22bn) worth of US goods in retaliation to Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, escalating a global trade war.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, called the 25% US levies on global imports of the metals “unjustified trade restrictions”, after they came into force at 4am GMT on Wednesday.“We deeply regret this measure,” von der Leyen said in a statement, where she announced “strong, but proportionate” countermeasures would come into force from 1 April. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.The retaliatory measures include Brussels reimposing tariffs on US goods including bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes, which it introduced during the first Trump term and later suspended after talks with his successor, Joe Biden.These tariffs, which target notable US goods worth €4.5bn, often from Republican states, will snap back on 1 April. But we will keep all options on the table”.Starmer, who had previously said that the UK did not need to choose between the EU and the US, had already announced on Tuesday that Britain would not respond with its own counter-tariffs, after last-ditch efforts to persuade Trump to spare British industry from his global tariffs failed.EU officials said they were talking to counterparts in other countries, including the UK, Switzerland, Norway, Canada and Japan, but there had not been any coordination over responses.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionOfficials also indicated they had not ruled out imposing “safeguard measures” – tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminium from other countries – if US trade barriers resulted in a flood of imports into Europe. “Whatever they charge us, we’re charging them,” he told reporters.The UK steel industry warned that Trump’s tariffs would have “hugely damaging consequences for UK suppliers and their customers in the US”.Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade association UK Steel, said: “President Trump must surely recognise that the UK is an ally, not a foe. “These tariffs couldn’t come at a worse time for the UK steel industry, as we battle with high energy costs and subdued demand at home, against an oversupplied and increasingly protectionist global landscape.”Bernd Lange, the German Social Democratic MEP who chairs the European parliament’s trade committee, described the tariffs as “another dose of self-inflicted tariff pain by the Trump administration”.He said the latest tariffs were “particularly bad” because “they target US trade partners, they are set arbitrarily, without legal and economic justifications, and they fail to address non-market overcapacity – the main issue steel and aluminium industry across the Atlantic is confronted with”.The introduction of EU measures came after a day of drama on Tuesday, when Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium in response to Canadian threats to increase electricity prices for US customers.The US president backed off from those plans after the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, agreed to suspend his province’s decision to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionTrump administrationInternational tradeUS politicsCanadaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this story‘In economic terms, Trump’s tariffs make no sense at all’EU offered ‘zero-for-zero’ deal to US weeks before tariff announcementKeir and Rachel stay upbeat amid chaos caused by He Who Cannot Be NamedGlobal stock markets fall and dollar dives after Trump announces sweeping tariffsCaribbean is friend of US, not an enemy, tariff-hit regional leaders tell Trump‘Liberation day’: what are tariffs and why do they matter?Trump trade wars are slowing global growth and fuelling inflation, says OECDStarmer announces support for car and pharma industries in ‘age of insecurity’Trump tariffs risk higher prices and make US recession more likely, says JP Morgan bossEU must brace for impact of Trump wrecking ball on global trading systemMost viewedMost viewed

“Women and girls in Romania face an increasingly hostile landscape, as they seek to make decisions about their own bodies and health care,” said Song Ah Lee, former Finberg Fellow at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “The Romanian authorities are not only failing to uphold sexual and reproductive health rights but are often enabling efforts to block women and girls from exercising these rights.” The report is based on 64 interviews, with women who discussed their experiences of seeking sexual and reproductive health care, healthcare providers, and activists fighting for reproductive rights in Romania. Women and girls living in rural areas, and people from marginalized communities or with limited financial means, face even greater barriers.In failing to tackle obstacles to accessing safe abortion, contraception, and sexual and reproductive health information, Romania is violating its human rights obligations under European and international law. Romania should take all necessary steps, including legislative reform, to ensure that comprehensive sexuality education is provided to all students, and that women and girls can exercise their rights to access safe and legal abortion services and contraception in practice. Romanian authorities should especially focus on ensuring that unmonitored and unregulated processes in the healthcare system, lack of information, availability, or affordability are not impeding women and girls from making informed decisions about their health, Human Rights Watch said.Romania has a grim history when it comes to sexual and reproductive health rights. To ensure compliance with Decree 770, that government monitored women’s reproductive status by recruiting informants, usually current or former medical workers or students, to spy on them, and by subjecting them to invasive and humiliating medical checkups in the presence of police.Because of the regulation and its abusive implementation, women and girls with unwanted pregnancies often had unsafe abortions, leading to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 women and girls, although some experts believe the number to be much higher. $50

Women and girls living in rural areas, and people from marginalized communities or with limited financial means, face even greater barriers.In failing to tackle obstacles to accessing safe abortion, contraception, and sexual and reproductive health information, Romania is violating its human rights obligations under European and international law. Romania should take all necessary steps, including legislative reform, to ensure that comprehensive sexuality education is provided to all students, and that women and girls can exercise their rights to access safe and legal abortion services and contraception in practice. Romanian authorities should especially focus on ensuring that unmonitored and unregulated processes in the healthcare system, lack of information, availability, or affordability are not impeding women and girls from making informed decisions about their health, Human Rights Watch said.Romania has a grim history when it comes to sexual and reproductive health rights. To ensure compliance with Decree 770, that government monitored women’s reproductive status by recruiting informants, usually current or former medical workers or students, to spy on them, and by subjecting them to invasive and humiliating medical checkups in the presence of police.Because of the regulation and its abusive implementation, women and girls with unwanted pregnancies often had unsafe abortions, leading to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 women and girls, although some experts believe the number to be much higher. $50

The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.

“Women and girls in Romania face an increasingly hostile landscape, as they seek to make decisions about their own bodies and health care,” said Song Ah Lee, former Finberg Fellow at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “The Romanian authorities are not only failing to uphold sexual and reproductive health rights but are often enabling efforts to block women and girls from exercising these rights.” The report is based on 64 interviews, with women who discussed their experiences of seeking sexual and reproductive health care, healthcare providers, and activists fighting for reproductive rights in Romania. Women and girls living in rural areas, and people from marginalized communities or with limited financial means, face even greater barriers.In failing to tackle obstacles to accessing safe abortion, contraception, and sexual and reproductive health information, Romania is violating its human rights obligations under European and international law. Romania should take all necessary steps, including legislative reform, to ensure that comprehensive sexuality education is provided to all students, and that women and girls can exercise their rights to access safe and legal abortion services and contraception in practice. Romanian authorities should especially focus on ensuring that unmonitored and unregulated processes in the healthcare system, lack of information, availability, or affordability are not impeding women and girls from making informed decisions about their health, Human Rights Watch said.Romania has a grim history when it comes to sexual and reproductive health rights. To ensure compliance with Decree 770, that government monitored women’s reproductive status by recruiting informants, usually current or former medical workers or students, to spy on them, and by subjecting them to invasive and humiliating medical checkups in the presence of police.Because of the regulation and its abusive implementation, women and girls with unwanted pregnancies often had unsafe abortions, leading to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 women and girls, although some experts believe the number to be much higher. Romania should remember its own destructive history and fully respect the rights of women and girls.”

General Assembly Designates 7 April International Day of Reflection on 1994 Genocide against Tutsi in Rwanda, Amending Title of Annual Observance









The General Assembly adopted a decision today designating 7 April as the International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, recalling also that Hutu and others who opposed it were killed. Introducing the decision, Valentine Rugwabiza (Rwanda) said it sought to correct inaccuracies in the Assembly’s 2003 resolution establishing the International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda, particularly its title and operative paragraph one. Speaking after the adoption, Kelley Eckels-Currie (United States) said that, since the 2003 establishment of International Day of Reflection, 7 April had become a solemn occasion to commemorate the 800,000 lives lost in the genocide. The United States was also committed to preserving the evidence of the genocide, she said, among the strongest measures to take to preserve the histories of what had taken place and capture the scope of acts committed. While the United States would not stand in the way of changing the title, she underscored that her country’s understanding of the circumstances of the genocide had not narrowed and that it would continue to commemorate all victims. In his remarks on 7 April 2017, the United Nations Secretary-General said 800,000 people had been murdered in the genocide, who were overwhelmingly Tutsis, but others were killed, as well. Article 19 states that a United Nations member in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount equals or exceeds the amount of contributions due from it for the preceding two full years.

Speaking after the adoption, Kelley Eckels-Currie (United States) said that, since the 2003 establishment of International Day of Reflection, 7 April had become a solemn occasion to commemorate the 800,000 lives lost in the genocide. The United States was also committed to preserving the evidence of the genocide, she said, among the strongest measures to take to preserve the histories of what had taken place and capture the scope of acts committed. While the United States would not stand in the way of changing the title, she underscored that her country’s understanding of the circumstances of the genocide had not narrowed and that it would continue to commemorate all victims. In his remarks on 7 April 2017, the United Nations Secretary-General said 800,000 people had been murdered in the genocide, who were overwhelmingly Tutsis, but others were killed, as well. Article 19 states that a United Nations member in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount equals or exceeds the amount of contributions due from it for the preceding two full years.

In his remarks on 7 April 2017, the United Nations Secretary-General said 800,000 people had been murdered in the genocide, who were overwhelmingly Tutsis, but others were killed, as well. Article 19 states that a United Nations member in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount equals or exceeds the amount of contributions due from it for the preceding two full years. The General Assembly adopted a decision today designating 7 April as the International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, recalling also that Hutu and others who opposed it were killed. Introducing the decision, Valentine Rugwabiza (Rwanda) said it sought to correct inaccuracies in the Assembly’s 2003 resolution establishing the International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda, particularly its title and operative paragraph one.

Avec la fonte des glaciers atteignant des niveaux records, cet événement soulignera le rôle crucial des glaciers en tant que ""châteaux d'eau du monde"" pour des milliards de personnes qui en dépendent.Cet événement marquera également le lancement du Rapport mondial des Nations Unies sur la mise en valeur des ressources en eau 2025, intitulé ""Hautes montagnes et glaciers"". Ce rapport met en avant le rôle des glaciers dans le maintien des réserves d’eau et la stabilité des écosystèmes, offrant des analyses basées sur des données scientifiques pour guider la gestion durable de l’eau et les stratégies d’adaptation des communautés à travers le monde. Par ailleurs, cette célébration posera les bases de la Décennie d’action pour les sciences cryosphériques (2025-2034), encourageant la coopération internationale en matière de recherche scientifique et de surveillance afin de mieux comprendre et atténuer les effets des changements affectant la cryosphère.En lire plus à propos de l'événement         Daniel Kordan         S'inscrire à l'événementLa 1ère Journée mondiale des glaciers et la Journée mondiale de l'eau 2025 sont ouvertes à tous.

Avec la fonte des glaciers atteignant des niveaux records, cet événement soulignera le rôle crucial des glaciers en tant que ""châteaux d'eau du monde"" pour des milliards de personnes qui en dépendent.Cet événement marquera également le lancement du Rapport mondial des Nations Unies sur la mise en valeur des ressources en eau 2025, intitulé ""Hautes montagnes et glaciers"". Ce rapport met en avant le rôle des glaciers dans le maintien des réserves d’eau et la stabilité des écosystèmes, offrant des analyses basées sur des données scientifiques pour guider la gestion durable de l’eau et les stratégies d’adaptation des communautés à travers le monde. Par ailleurs, cette célébration posera les bases de la Décennie d’action pour les sciences cryosphériques (2025-2034), encourageant la coopération internationale en matière de recherche scientifique et de surveillance afin de mieux comprendre et atténuer les effets des changements affectant la cryosphère.En lire plus à propos de l'événement         Daniel Kordan         S'inscrire à l'événementLa 1ère Journée mondiale des glaciers et la Journée mondiale de l'eau 2025 sont ouvertes à tous.

 A tribute to the victims, a reflection on the survivors 
 Thirty-one years ago, the world witnessed one of the most tragic events in recent human history. Arms transfers and human rights 
 States and private companies have obligations and responsibilities under international law and standards to prevent, address and mitigate the negative impact on human rights caused by arms transfers. As the world faces the highest number of conflicts since World War II, an increasing number of human rights advocates, lawyers and non-governmental organizations are turning to courts to compel States to prevent arms supplies that fuel human rights violations, and hold States and companies accountable. Each year, the United Nations observes the International Day for the Right to the Truth Concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and for the Dignity of Victims. Abolition of the death penalty is gaining momentum worldwide 
 The death penalty has no place in the 21st century, affirms the UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk citing its contribution to wrongful executions. Shelter protects and empowers women facing gender-based violence in Tunisia 
 In Kairouan, central Tunisia, a shelter established by women's human rights defenders provides protection, psychological care, medical consultations, and legal support for women and children who are survivors of gender-based and domestic violence. On International Women’s Day, the UN Human Rights (OHCHR) recognized the efforts of women activists and feminist movements in the fight against violence towards women and girls. UNESCO Gives Voice to Afghan Women and Girls: Restoring Their Rights 
 Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, education for girls over 12 has been banned, making Afghanistan the only country where girls cannot attend secondary school. On the International Day to Combat Islamophobia (15 March), the UN Secretary-General calls on everyone to cooperate to promote equality and human rights. Temacapulín's unyielding resistance 
 UN Human Rights in Mexico supports climate-affected communities, advocating for international standards on housing, food, water, and reparation rights. Faith-based cooperation is essential to the protection of human rights for all 
 “More and more conflicts are shattering lives, livelihoods and our shared future,” said UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk in the General Assembly of ACT Alliance, a global faith-based coalition organized in national and regional forums operating in more than 120 countries. Emphasizing equal rights for all individuals, regardless of belief, Türk called for inclusive faith literacy and holistic human rights education to counter hate. UN Human Right’s “Faith for Rights” framework, established in 2017, encourages religious leaders to uphold universal rights and promote peaceful coexistence. They are just a stepping stone to who you truly are.”

Water and Peace | UN-Water,https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/water-and-peace,other,0.3,,"Between countries, the widespread lack of transboundary cooperation on shared water resources poses a risk to the quality and quantity of water supplies and therefore threatens social and international stability. Water often plays a role in conflict:

Water can be a trigger when interests of different water users, including States and provinces, clash and are perceived as irreconcilable, or when water quantity and/or quality decreases, which may affect human- and ecosystem health. Water can be a casualty of conflict when water resources, water systems or utility employees are intentional or incidental casualties or targets of violence. At the local and national level, different water users – particularly water and sanitation utilities, energy, food and industry – must cooperate through an integrated water resources management approach and promote a circular economy that fulfils people’s human rights.

Water and Peace




Water can create peace or spark conflict. Between countries, the widespread lack of transboundary cooperation on shared water resources poses a risk to the quality and quantity of water supplies and therefore threatens social and international stability. Water often plays a role in conflict:

Water can be a trigger when interests of different water users, including States and provinces, clash and are perceived as irreconcilable, or when water quantity and/or quality decreases, which may affect human- and ecosystem health. Water can be a casualty of conflict when water resources, water systems or utility employees are intentional or incidental casualties or targets of violence. At the local and national level, different water users – particularly water and sanitation utilities, energy, food and industry – must cooperate through an integrated water resources management approach and promote a circular economy that fulfils people’s human rights.

The sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, including the right to abortion and family planning methods, have been significantly eroded in Romania.Romanian authorities are not only failing to uphold sexual and reproductive health rights but is often enabling efforts to block women and girls from exercising these rights.Romanian authorities should ensure that unmonitored and unregulated processes in the healthcare system, lack of information, availability, or affordability are not impeding women and girls from making informed decisions about their health.(Berlin) – The sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, including the right to abortion and family planning methods, have been significantly eroded in Romania, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. Report: 
“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”

“Women and girls in Romania face an increasingly hostile landscape, as they seek to make decisions about their own bodies and health care,” said Song Ah Lee, former Finberg Fellow at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “The Romanian authorities are not only failing to uphold sexual and reproductive health rights but are often enabling efforts to block women and girls from exercising these rights.” The report is based on 64 interviews, with women who discussed their experiences of seeking sexual and reproductive health care, healthcare providers, and activists fighting for reproductive rights in Romania. Women and girls living in rural areas, and people from marginalized communities or with limited financial means, face even greater barriers.In failing to tackle obstacles to accessing safe abortion, contraception, and sexual and reproductive health information, Romania is violating its human rights obligations under European and international law. Romanian authorities should especially focus on ensuring that unmonitored and unregulated processes in the healthcare system, lack of information, availability, or affordability are not impeding women and girls from making informed decisions about their health, Human Rights Watch said.Romania has a grim history when it comes to sexual and reproductive health rights. To ensure compliance with Decree 770, that government monitored women’s reproductive status by recruiting informants, usually current or former medical workers or students, to spy on them, and by subjecting them to invasive and humiliating medical checkups in the presence of police.Because of the regulation and its abusive implementation, women and girls with unwanted pregnancies often had unsafe abortions, leading to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 women and girls, although some experts believe the number to be much higher. Romania should remember its own destructive history and fully respect the rights of women and girls.”

Chilling effect of online harassment in Philippines,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/04/philippines-state-sponsored-online-harassment-has-chilling-effect-on-young-human-rights-defenders/,NGO,0.4,,"*Names changed to protect identity   Amnesty International’s first ever youth-led report reveals that online harassment by the Philippine authorities, including the practice of “red-tagging” or labelling individuals as communists, creates a climate of fear that is deterring young human rights defenders from engaging in activism and expressing themselves freely. In the report, “Left to their own devices: The chilling effects of online harassment among young human rights defenders (YHRDs) in the Philippines,” young activists aged 18 to 24 shared experiences of being red-tagged, doxed with personal information published online without their consent, and trolled. “The chilling effect of online harassment severely impairs the rights of these young human rights defenders. However, this approach has left her conflicted: “It’s like you’re not taking a stand on what needs to be done.” Sarita*, a young advocate for peace and security in southern Philippines, said online harassment “made me feel so weak, so inferior compared to these politicians with all the powers that they have.” Online harassment affects various rights, including the right to freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, health, remedy, non-discrimination and the right to defend human rights. Amnesty International urges the Philippine government to end state-sponsored red-tagging, intimidation, harassment, threats or attacks against activists, including young human rights defenders. This research builds on findings of previous Amnesty International investigations, including how the two successive governments of President Duterte and President Marcos Jr have weaponized digital tools, misinformation and vague anti-terror laws to create a climate of fear and intimidation among young human rights defenders in the Philippines. *Names changed to protect identity   Amnesty International’s first ever youth-led report reveals that online harassment by the Philippine authorities, including the practice of “red-tagging” or labelling individuals as communists, creates a climate of fear that is deterring young human rights defenders from engaging in activism and expressing themselves freely.

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025
      














“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. March 17, 2025
      














“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

Poisonous Profit


Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia


                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Iran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations





























“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025
      














“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people. March 24, 2025
      














Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. March 17, 2025
      














“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation. March 17, 2025
      














Poisonous Profit


Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia


                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025

Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups.

“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups.

“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Iran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations





























“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025
      














“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people. March 24, 2025
      














Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. March 17, 2025
      














“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation. March 17, 2025
      














Poisonous Profit


Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia


                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Iran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations





























“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025
      














“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people. March 24, 2025
      














Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. March 17, 2025
      














“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation. March 17, 2025
      














Poisonous Profit


Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia


                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.

“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct.

Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023.

Stock markets across Europe slumped on Monday after Donald Trump said foreign governments would have to pay “a lot of money” to lift sweeping tariffs that he characterised as “medicine”.Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One late on Sunday, the US president indicated he was not concerned about market losses that have already wiped out nearly $6tn (£5tn) in value from US stocks. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he said.Trump’s comments triggered a mass sell-off on Asian stock markets overnight and prompted the billionaire investor Bill Ackman, one of the US president’s backers in the 2024 race for the White House, to call for a moratorium, saying that sweeping tariffs “on our friends and our enemies alike” had caused an “economic nuclear war”.Markets brace for another volatile week as Trump’s most punitive tariffs kick inRead moreIn Europe, stock markets plunged in early trading on Monday. They also tried to minimise the economic shocks from last week’s tumultuous rollout.The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said more than 50 nations had started negotiations with the US since last Wednesday’s announcement.Bessent said there was “no reason” to anticipate a recession, citing stronger-than-anticipated US jobs growth last month, before the tariffs were announced.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe US president spent the weekend in Florida, playing golf and posting a video of his swing to social media on Sunday.US customs agents began collecting Trump’s unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday. Higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11% to 50% on individual countries are due to take effect on Wednesday at 12.01am eastern daily time.Some governments have already signalled a willingness to engage with the US to avoid the duties.In his first significant intervention since the US ushered in a new economic era last week, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the government would step in to support key British industries.He is to announce plans to give carmakers more flexibility over how they meet a target to stop sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. “With Europe facing both recession and disinflation from global trade disruption, we suspect ECB/BoE terminal rate pricing can shift lower still,” market strategists at the US bank Citi wrote in a note to clients.Goldman Sachs increased its predictions for a US recession over the next 12 months, from a 35% chance to 45%.Tariff-stunned markets face another week of potential turmoil after the worst week for US stocks since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago.The White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett denied the tariffs were part of a Trump strategy to crash financial markets to pressure the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

International human rights law lays down the obligations of Governments to act in certain ways or to refrain from certain acts, in order to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals or groups. Universal Declaration of Human Rights





The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights. The UDHR, together with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols (on the complaints procedure and on the death penalty) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its Optional Protocol, form the so-called International Bill of Human Rights. Human Rights Conventions
A series of international human rights treaties and other instruments adopted since 1945 have expanded the body of international human rights law. Human Rights Council





The Human Rights Council, established on 15 March 2006 by the General Assembly and reporting directly to it, replaced the 60-year-old UN Commission on Human Rights as the key UN intergovernmental body responsible for human rights. The Council is made up of 47 State representatives and is tasked with strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe by addressing situations of human rights violations and making recommendations on them, including responding to human rights emergencies
The most innovative feature of the Human Rights Council is the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). Special Procedures and Investigative Bodies
The Human Rights Council also has special procedures that consist of independent human rights experts who have the mandate to report and advise on human rights from a thematic or country-specific perspective. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights exercises principal responsibility for UN human rights activities. Some examples are the right to development, which is at the core of the Sustainable Development Goals; the right to food, championed by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, labour rights, defined and protected by the International Labour Organization, gender equality, which is promulgated by UN Women, the rights of children, indigenous peoples, and disabled persons
Human Rights Day is observed every year on 10 December. The OHCHR conducted a year-long commemoration, the Human Rights Initiative, during which 150 Member States, NGOs, businesses and UN entities made pledges on a wide range of human rights issues - from advancing women’s rights, and children’s rights, to commitments on climate change, and empowering people with disabilities to ensure legislative reforms.

International human rights law lays down the obligations of Governments to act in certain ways or to refrain from certain acts, in order to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals or groups. Universal Declaration of Human Rights





The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights. The UDHR, together with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols (on the complaints procedure and on the death penalty) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its Optional Protocol, form the so-called International Bill of Human Rights. Human Rights Conventions
A series of international human rights treaties and other instruments adopted since 1945 have expanded the body of international human rights law. Human Rights Council





The Human Rights Council, established on 15 March 2006 by the General Assembly and reporting directly to it, replaced the 60-year-old UN Commission on Human Rights as the key UN intergovernmental body responsible for human rights. The Council is made up of 47 State representatives and is tasked with strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe by addressing situations of human rights violations and making recommendations on them, including responding to human rights emergencies
The most innovative feature of the Human Rights Council is the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). Special Procedures and Investigative Bodies
The Human Rights Council also has special procedures that consist of independent human rights experts who have the mandate to report and advise on human rights from a thematic or country-specific perspective. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights exercises principal responsibility for UN human rights activities. Some examples are the right to development, which is at the core of the Sustainable Development Goals; the right to food, championed by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, labour rights, defined and protected by the International Labour Organization, gender equality, which is promulgated by UN Women, the rights of children, indigenous peoples, and disabled persons
Human Rights Day is observed every year on 10 December. The OHCHR conducted a year-long commemoration, the Human Rights Initiative, during which 150 Member States, NGOs, businesses and UN entities made pledges on a wide range of human rights issues - from advancing women’s rights, and children’s rights, to commitments on climate change, and empowering people with disabilities to ensure legislative reforms.

Avec la fonte des glaciers atteignant des niveaux records, cet événement soulignera le rôle crucial des glaciers en tant que ""châteaux d'eau du monde"" pour des milliards de personnes qui en dépendent.Cet événement marquera également le lancement du Rapport mondial des Nations Unies sur la mise en valeur des ressources en eau 2025, intitulé ""Hautes montagnes et glaciers"". Ce rapport met en avant le rôle des glaciers dans le maintien des réserves d’eau et la stabilité des écosystèmes, offrant des analyses basées sur des données scientifiques pour guider la gestion durable de l’eau et les stratégies d’adaptation des communautés à travers le monde. Par ailleurs, cette célébration posera les bases de la Décennie d’action pour les sciences cryosphériques (2025-2034), encourageant la coopération internationale en matière de recherche scientifique et de surveillance afin de mieux comprendre et atténuer les effets des changements affectant la cryosphère.En lire plus à propos de l'événement         Daniel Kordan         S'inscrire à l'événementLa 1ère Journée mondiale des glaciers et la Journée mondiale de l'eau 2025 sont ouvertes à tous.

Avec la fonte des glaciers atteignant des niveaux records, cet événement soulignera le rôle crucial des glaciers en tant que ""châteaux d'eau du monde"" pour des milliards de personnes qui en dépendent.Cet événement marquera également le lancement du Rapport mondial des Nations Unies sur la mise en valeur des ressources en eau 2025, intitulé ""Hautes montagnes et glaciers"". Ce rapport met en avant le rôle des glaciers dans le maintien des réserves d’eau et la stabilité des écosystèmes, offrant des analyses basées sur des données scientifiques pour guider la gestion durable de l’eau et les stratégies d’adaptation des communautés à travers le monde. Par ailleurs, cette célébration posera les bases de la Décennie d’action pour les sciences cryosphériques (2025-2034), encourageant la coopération internationale en matière de recherche scientifique et de surveillance afin de mieux comprendre et atténuer les effets des changements affectant la cryosphère.En lire plus à propos de l'événement         Daniel Kordan         S'inscrire à l'événementLa 1ère Journée mondiale des glaciers et la Journée mondiale de l'eau 2025 sont ouvertes à tous.

Avec la fonte des glaciers atteignant des niveaux records, cet événement soulignera le rôle crucial des glaciers en tant que ""châteaux d'eau du monde"" pour des milliards de personnes qui en dépendent.Cet événement marquera également le lancement du Rapport mondial des Nations Unies sur la mise en valeur des ressources en eau 2025, intitulé ""Hautes montagnes et glaciers"". Ce rapport met en avant le rôle des glaciers dans le maintien des réserves d’eau et la stabilité des écosystèmes, offrant des analyses basées sur des données scientifiques pour guider la gestion durable de l’eau et les stratégies d’adaptation des communautés à travers le monde. Par ailleurs, cette célébration posera les bases de la Décennie d’action pour les sciences cryosphériques (2025-2034), encourageant la coopération internationale en matière de recherche scientifique et de surveillance afin de mieux comprendre et atténuer les effets des changements affectant la cryosphère.En lire plus à propos de l'événement         Daniel Kordan         S'inscrire à l'événementLa 1ère Journée mondiale des glaciers et la Journée mondiale de l'eau 2025 sont ouvertes à tous.

  Earth System domains




Cryosphere includes the components of the Earth System at and below the land and ocean surface that are frozen, including snow cover, glaciers, ice sheets, ice shelves, icebergs, sea ice, lake ice, river ice, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground, and solid precipitation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) states that “over the last decades, global warming has led to widespread shrinking of the cryosphere, with mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers, reduction in snow cover, and Arctic Sea ice extent and thickness, and increased permafrost temperatures”. Melting of glaciers and ice caps in the second half of the 20th century led to about a 2.5 cm rise in sea level, in contrast to the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which added about 1 cm to sea level. The WMO's Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) fosters international coordination and partnerships between scientific and operational communities with the goal of meeting the cryosphere data and information need of Members and partners, in support of Earth system monitoring, modelling and prediction. The Executive Council Panel on Polar and High Mountain Observation, Research and Services (EC-PHORS) plays a meaningful role on overseeing, coordinating, and monitoring how polar and high-mountain observations, research, services and policies are developed and implemented within and externally to WMO, in response to significant changes in the polar and high mountain environments.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) states that “over the last decades, global warming has led to widespread shrinking of the cryosphere, with mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers, reduction in snow cover, and Arctic Sea ice extent and thickness, and increased permafrost temperatures”. Melting of glaciers and ice caps in the second half of the 20th century led to about a 2.5 cm rise in sea level, in contrast to the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which added about 1 cm to sea level. The WMO's Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) fosters international coordination and partnerships between scientific and operational communities with the goal of meeting the cryosphere data and information need of Members and partners, in support of Earth system monitoring, modelling and prediction. The Executive Council Panel on Polar and High Mountain Observation, Research and Services (EC-PHORS) plays a meaningful role on overseeing, coordinating, and monitoring how polar and high-mountain observations, research, services and policies are developed and implemented within and externally to WMO, in response to significant changes in the polar and high mountain environments.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) states that “over the last decades, global warming has led to widespread shrinking of the cryosphere, with mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers, reduction in snow cover, and Arctic Sea ice extent and thickness, and increased permafrost temperatures”. Melting of glaciers and ice caps in the second half of the 20th century led to about a 2.5 cm rise in sea level, in contrast to the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which added about 1 cm to sea level. The WMO's Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) fosters international coordination and partnerships between scientific and operational communities with the goal of meeting the cryosphere data and information need of Members and partners, in support of Earth system monitoring, modelling and prediction.

Romania: Dangerous Rollback of Reproductive Rights






Access to Abortion, Contraception, Sexuality Education Increasingly Blocked

The sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, including the right to abortion and family planning methods, have been significantly eroded in Romania.Romanian authorities are not only failing to uphold sexual and reproductive health rights but is often enabling efforts to block women and girls from exercising these rights.Romanian authorities should ensure that unmonitored and unregulated processes in the healthcare system, lack of information, availability, or affordability are not impeding women and girls from making informed decisions about their health.(Berlin) – The sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, including the right to abortion and family planning methods, have been significantly eroded in Romania, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.

Rights groups say his government allows no dissent and voting remains tightly controlled, such as in a recent referendum introducing constitutional changes that will enable Mirziyoyev to remain in power until 2040.Jana Toom, the vice-chair of the European parliament’s delegation for central Asia, said central Asian countries were not doing enough to stop circumvention of EU sanctions against Russia, although she added that they had not made any commitments on this score.Asked whether the EU was striking the right balance between economic interests and human rights, the Estonian liberal MEP said: “I believe that if we have beneficial cooperation between the European Union and central Asia, things will improve. And we have to take into account also the fact where they find themselves: between Russia and China, and they are trying to balance.”

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.

“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025

Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups.

“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights.

“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025

                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups.

“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened.

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Iran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations





























“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025
      














“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people. March 24, 2025
      














Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. March 17, 2025
      














“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation. March 17, 2025
      














Poisonous Profit


Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia


                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Iran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations





























“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025
      














“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people. March 24, 2025
      














Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. March 17, 2025
      














“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation. March 17, 2025
      














Poisonous Profit


Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia


                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. And an evacuation system that has unashamedly failed to keep civilians in Gaza safe.SOUNDBITE: GhassanI have here [a video] when they [Israeli forces] dropped leaflets on us to evacuate. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

Building Uganda’s Prosperity Through Free Pre-Primary Education 



Three recent independent reports have made a compelling case for Uganda to invest in pre-primary education. In June 2024, the Initiative for Economic and Social Rights (ISER) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a study on access to pre-primary education (or nursery) in Uganda, based on interviews with over 100 parents, teachers, children, and education officials around the country.

Iran: UN Expands Investigations into Rights Violations





























“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children. March 26, 2025
      














“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people. March 24, 2025
      














Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. March 17, 2025
      














“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation. March 17, 2025
      














Poisonous Profit


Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia


                    The 67-page report, “Poisonous Profit: Lead Waste Mining and Children’s Right to a Healthy Environment in Kabwe, Zambia,” documents the Zambian government’s issuance of mining and processing licenses for South African, Chinese, and local businesses and its failure to intervene against blatant violations of Zambian environmental and mining law by several mining and processing companies.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

“It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing”


Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania


                    The 73-page report, “‘It’s Happening Even Without You Noticing’: Increasing Barriers to Accessing Sexual and Reproductive Health Care in Romania,” documents that, although these rights are partially protected under Romanian law, in practice women and girls are regularly and systematically thwarted in their efforts to exercise these rights. April 7, 2025
      














“All I Know Is I Want Them Home”


Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia


                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

“It Tears You Apart”


Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System


                    The 81-page report, “‘It Tears You Apart’: Poverty and Gender in Germany’s Social Security System”, documents increasing poverty and the failure of the German social security system to ensure the right to an adequate standard of living for many people.

Living in Fear and Humiliation


Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia


                    The 63-page report, “Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,” documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups.

“There’s Just No More Land”


Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

                    The 86-page report, “‘All I Know Is I Want Them Home’: Disproportionate Removal of Aboriginal Children from Families in Western Australia,” describes how authorities in the state of Western Australia have been quick to remove children from Aboriginal mothers fleeing domestic violence and from Aboriginal parents without adequate housing, rather than providing appropriate services to address domestic violence and homelessness. Western Australia has the highest rate of overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care of any state or territory in Australia, and Aboriginal children are more than 20 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care than non-Indigenous children.

Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands


                    The 66-page report, “‘There’s Just No More Land’: Community-led Planned Relocation as Last-resort Adaptation to Sea Level Rise in Solomon Islands,” documents why Walande community members made the difficult decision to relocate after decades of adapting to climate change in place, how they moved without adequate government and international assistance, and how their enjoyment of their economic, social, and cultural rights is still threatened. Human Rights Watch found that the Solomon Islands’ government has taken important steps to support communities facing the most acute impacts of the climate crisis, including by adopting Planned Relocation Guidelines, but has not yet fully put them in operation.

DATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023,Gaza SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryWe’ve just been targeted. No need to worry, we’re okay.VO:This is the story of two Palestinian residents, Ghassan and Sara, who sought to escape the violence in Gaza but were trapped in the hostilities and their lives irreversibly changed.TITLE:WARNINGThis video contains violent images and descriptionsincluding people injured, and distressing scenes.Viewer discretion advised.TITLE:NOWHERE IS SAFETITLE:GHASSANDATE LOCATOR:Oct, 2023, GazaVO:Since the start of the hostilities, Ghassan has kept a video diary documenting his daily life.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan, video diaryJabalia camp is completely isolated from the world, they cut the internet, they cut everything.VO:Israel has enforced a tight blockade of Gaza. The evacuation should be temporary, and displaced people should be free and able to return to their homes as soon as possible after the hostilities end in that area.Israel’s military has displaced 90 percent of the Gaza population, around 1.9 million people.VO/ANIMATED MAP:This map shows the evacuation order on October 13, 2023, directing civilians towards supposed ‘safe zones.’ Human Rights Watch investigated the Israeli authorities’ policies and conduct. If I turn to this side, I bump into something and if I turn to the other side, I bump into something.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryThe bombing continues, with massive destruction and limited resources.TITLE:Hamoud, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAnd this is Hamoud.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat do you think of the current situation?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryGood.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryAre you scared of the sounds of bombing?SOUNDBITE: Hamoud, [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat is your wish?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryFor the war to end.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhere do you want to go?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryCome, Bilal.TITLE:Bilal, Ghassan’s sonSOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWhat’s your wish, Bilal?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryTo go back home.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryDo you want to go back home?SOUNDBITE: Bilal [Ghassan’s son] video diaryYes, to eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryTo eat and drink.SOUNDBITE: Ghassan video diaryWe hope the war ends and we return to our homes.SOUNDBITE: GhassanThey [Israeli forces] claimed Rafah is a safe area, that Rafah has humanitarian aid. Seeing all of this has affected my kids hugely, it changed us all.VO/ANIMATED MAP:By analyzing online evacuation orders and photographs of air-dropped leaflets posted online, Human Rights Watch established that block 108 was not designated for evacuation until six-and-a-half weeks after this strike. Human Rights Watch identified at least six additional strikes in this block before the attack on Sara’s relatives’ home which also damaged hers on December, 7, 2023. I hope...that the time will come when I return to my home,and I rest my head on my pillow in freedom and peace.END CREDITS:Narrator: Nadia HardmanProducer / Editor: Ellie KealeyProducers: Gabi Ivens, Carolina Jordá Álvarez, Léo Martine, Ekin ÜrgenVideographer: Yousef al MasharawiGraphics: Win EdsonAdditional footage / Photographs: Ghassan Salem, AFP, IMAGOMusic: Audio Network

We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals.""The US president went on to reiterate his threat of additional 50% tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing did not walk back from its retaliatory plans by tomorrow (Tuesday).Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesWe've been hearing from the White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, who encourages nations hoping to escape reciprocal US tariffs to make offers to US President Donald Trump.Miran says the president would welcome moves to lower barriers to US exports, according to the Reuters news agency.Speaking at the Hudson Institute think-tank, Miran says he believes a range of US policies, including deregulation, would keep inflation under control.His remarks come amid global markets volatility for another trading day.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMore from Trump now in the White House.

The Israeli PM says they will eliminate the trade deficit with the US, adding he thinks it's the right thing to do.Netanyahu says that they intended to take down trade barriers and that Israel can be a model of other countries.He says he recognises the problems the US has with the system as it currently stands.You can follow the latest updates on Trump's meeting with Netanyahu in our other live page, currently being run by our colleagues in Washington DC and New York.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNatalie ShermanNew York business reporterWhen President Trump entered the White House in January, about two thirds of goods sent from China to the US were already facing tariffs, as a result of actions he took during his first term.His moves then hit items like solar panels, washing machines and other kinds of machinery. But the announcement means the vast majority of imports from China - which accounted for more than $400bn in trade last year, making it America's top source of imports after the European Union and Mexico - are facing a
tariff rate of at least 54% - which Trump has now threatened to raise
again by another 50 percentage points.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersImage caption, A table showing all the new US tariffs on countries was unveiled by President Trump on WednesdayFurther countries have been reaching out to the US in order to reach a deal before higher custom tariffs on roughly 60 nations are due start on Wednesday 9 April.Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus has written a letter to US President Donald Trump to ask for a three-month pause to the tariffs he has imposed on them, a statement from their government said on Monday.Last week, the US announced 37% tariffs on the country, which is the world's second largest garment manufacturer.In the letter, Yunus also said his country ""will take all necessary actions to fully support [Trump's] trade agenda"".Meanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said he held a call with Trump in which ""both sides decided to designate cabinet members to take charge and continue discussions"". Currently, Japan faces 26% tariffs.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is due to tell the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday that nearly 50 countries have reached out to him to discuss the new tariffs, according to a written testimony seen by Reuters news agency.Greer says Argentina, Vietnam and Israel are among these nations.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he has been tasked with opening trade negotiations with Japan ""following a very constructive phone discussion"" between both governments.

response to sharp falls on global markets following his tariff announcements,
President Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, earlier to praise the state of the US
economy. âOil
prices are down, interest rates are downâ¦ food prices are down, there is NO
INFLATION,â he wrote.Itâs
true that global oil prices, external have fallen steeply since the tariffs were
announced and interest rates on 30-year and 15-year fixed rate mortgages are
down too.Last month, food prices rose slightly â up by 0.2% â which
was a slower increase than the previous month.Overall inflation currently stands at 2.8%, external, down slightly from former President Bidenâs last month in office.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, ReutersImage caption, Maros SefcovicWhile we've been reporting on events in the US, EU trade ministers have been meeting in Luxembourg today to discuss how they will move forward.

Donald Trump shocked the global economy with his aggressive tariff announcement
â which includes 17% on Israeli exports to America.This meeting gives the Israeli prime minister a chance to make an
in-person case that those tariffs should be lower.Israel recently dropped its own tariffs on American imports,
although that move did not prevent it from being targeted in the presidentâs
new trade policy. The index saw a spike this afternoon after reports that Trump was considering a 90-day pause to the tariffs, but that turned out to be false.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, EPAMexico wants to avoid imposing reciprocal tariffs on US goods but it does not rule it out, President Claudia Sheinbaum says.Sheinbaum says that her country wants to continue talks with Washington before taking on any other measures, whilst protecting Mexican industries and companies.Mexico and Canada were spared the further tariffs announced for most other economies on 2 April. Both countries had already seen tariffs imposed in February - though these have since been partially rolled back.In March, US President Donald Trump announced he would temporarily suspend tariffs on Mexico ""as accommodation, and out of respect for"" the country's president.The US is one of Mexico's largest export markets.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMarkets worldwide have tumbled since US President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on imports from from nearly all economies.Asia-Pacific stocks from Shanghai to Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong plunged on Monday by levels not seen in decades. In Europe, the biggest stocks continued to slide - as is the case in the US, where trading is still open.The impact on the UK's FTSE 100, America's S&P 500, Germany's Dax and Japan's Nikkei has been wide-ranging.Here's an overview of each drop:Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBy Gerry GeorgievaDuring the 15 minutes that President Donald Trump spoke to reporters last
night, he claimed that the United States was running a $1tn trade deficit with
China.He's just announced that he plans to hit Beijing with an extra 50% tariff unless it drops retaliatory levy We canât find any evidence for his claim, which he made
several timesThe US does run a trade deficit with China, meaning that it
imports more in goods from that country than it exports to it, but the figure
was just over $295bn for 2024, external. Globally, in
2024, China exported nearly $1tn more goods, external than it imported so itâs possible
that Trump may have been mistakenly referring to this figure.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMitchell LabiakBBC Business reporterEuropeâs biggest stock markets have all closed over 4% down after another hectic day following Trumpâs tariff announcements.The FTSE 100 index - made up of the largest firms listed in the UK - sunk 4.4% after the dayâs trading while the German Dax dropped 4.1% and the French Cac 40 fell 4.8%.To give you a sense of just how grim today was for the FTSE 100, only five stocks ended the day in the green - and by some pretty thin margins. That could mean companies cutting back and raising prices - hitting workers and consumers.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNatalie ShermanNew York business reporterTrump has just threated to hit imports from China with
an additional 50% tax, unless Beijing withdraws the retaliatory measures it

response to sharp falls on global markets following his tariff announcements,
President Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, earlier to praise the state of the US
economy. âOil
prices are down, interest rates are downâ¦ food prices are down, there is NO
INFLATION,â he wrote.Itâs
true that global oil prices, external have fallen steeply since the tariffs were
announced and interest rates on 30-year and 15-year fixed rate mortgages are
down too.Last month, food prices rose slightly â up by 0.2% â which
was a slower increase than the previous month.Overall inflation currently stands at 2.8%, external, down slightly from former President Bidenâs last month in office.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing

night, he claimed that the United States was running a $1tn trade deficit with
China.He's just announced that he plans to hit Beijing with an extra 50% tariff unless it drops retaliatory levy We canât find any evidence for his claim, which he made
several timesThe US does run a trade deficit with China, meaning that it
imports more in goods from that country than it exports to it, but the figure
was just over $295bn for 2024, external. Globally, in
2024, China exported nearly $1tn more goods, external than it imported so itâs possible
that Trump may have been mistakenly referring to this figure.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing

Keir Starmer has repeatedly insisted that he does not think it will be necessary for the UK to choose between the US and the EU. (See 5.40pm.) Starmer adopted a diplomatic, even-handed tone after President Trump contrasted the “nice” treatment he was getting from Starmer with the “atrocity” EU, in comments that implied Trump wants to force the UK to side with the US as the price for avoiding tariffs. But the six councils are all social care councils, and it means these upper limits will apply:Windsor and Maidenhead borough council – 9%Birmingham city council – 7.5%Bradford council – 10%Newham council – 9%Somerset council – 7.5%Trafford council – 7.5%The full details of the final local government settlement are here.The TaxPayers’ Alliance, a rightwing campaign group that does not often praise Labour, has welcomed the news. It posted this on social media.🚨BREAKING NEWS: 25% Council Tax Hike STOPPED in Windsor and Maidenhead 💪They will only be allowed to increase their council tax by 9%, meaning that the average household will be saving almost £300 😲Well done @AngelaRayner for standing up to town hall bosses 👏 pic.twitter.com/LedNdoKoEG— TaxPayers' Alliance (@the_tpa) February 3, 2025
As the press conference was winding up in Brussels, Keir Starmer was asked by a reporter from the Sun if he broke lockdown rules during Covid by designating his voice coach as a key worker. Mark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was “silly” to suggest that Trump’s threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. In response to a later question from ITV’s James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:
Your question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US – that is for so many reasons a silly thought …. He said:

When you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it’s very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US]. Starmer replied:
Look in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I’ve always been clear that both are important to us. That’s why, in my discussions with President Trump, we’ve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we’ve founded over many, many years …
Both of these relations are very important to us. Here is the full reply from Keir Starmer to a question Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, who asked him if, in the light of Donald Trump’s tariff threats, it was time to recognise that Trump was “a bad thing for Europe’s economic prosperity and security”. Starmer also said that the Ukraine war had led to Nato becoming “stronger and bigger”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte shaking hands at their press conference. Photograph: Simon Wohlfahrt/EPAQ: [To Starmer] What happens if you are forced to choose between the US and the UK?Starmer says it is vital for the UK that it works with both Europe and the US. But equally on defense and security with the US and the special relationship in relation to defense and security
He also says the UK has a huge amount of trade with both the US and the EU. Doesn’t Europe have to start planning a way of defending itself in future without the US?Rutte says the idea of Nato without the US is a “silly thought”.He says he is a “staunch Atlanticist” and thinks the west has to stay connected.And he says he knows that thinking is still prevalent in the White House.Q: Will you water down the EU reset to keep Trump onside?Starmer says the US and the EU are both important to the UK.That has always been the case, he says.He says, in talks with president Trump, he has spoken about defence and trade. UPDATE: See 5.05pm for a fuller version of the quote.Starmer and Rutte are now taking quesions.Q: [To Rutte] Do you fear the Atlantic alliance is unravelling?Rutte says there are always issues between allies.He says the US sells more to Europe than Europe does to them.And he claims this issue will “not have an impact on our collective deterrence”.Q: [To Starmer] Trump is threatening allies. Isn’t he a bad thing for security?Starmer says, on tariffs, it is “early days’.He says it is “really important” to have “open and strong trading relations”.And he plays tribute to the role the US has played in relation to Ukraine.Starmer goes on:
Things that would have provoked utter outrage just a few years ago have now become almost commonplace.

Keir Starmer has repeatedly insisted that he does not think it will be necessary for the UK to choose between the US and the EU. (See 5.40pm.) Starmer adopted a diplomatic, even-handed tone after President Trump contrasted the “nice” treatment he was getting from Starmer with the “atrocity” EU, in comments that implied Trump wants to force the UK to side with the US as the price for avoiding tariffs.

As the press conference was winding up in Brussels, Keir Starmer was asked by a reporter from the Sun if he broke lockdown rules during Covid by designating his voice coach as a key worker. Mark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was “silly” to suggest that Trump’s threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. In response to a later question from ITV’s James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:
Your question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US – that is for so many reasons a silly thought …. He said:

When you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it’s very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US]. Starmer replied:
Look in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I’ve always been clear that both are important to us. That’s why, in my discussions with President Trump, we’ve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we’ve founded over many, many years …
Both of these relations are very important to us. Here is the full reply from Keir Starmer to a question Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, who asked him if, in the light of Donald Trump’s tariff threats, it was time to recognise that Trump was “a bad thing for Europe’s economic prosperity and security”. Starmer also said that the Ukraine war had led to Nato becoming “stronger and bigger”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte shaking hands at their press conference.

He also says the UK has a huge amount of trade with both the US and the EU. Doesn’t Europe have to start planning a way of defending itself in future without the US?Rutte says the idea of Nato without the US is a “silly thought”.He says he is a “staunch Atlanticist” and thinks the west has to stay connected.And he says he knows that thinking is still prevalent in the White House.Q: Will you water down the EU reset to keep Trump onside?Starmer says the US and the EU are both important to the UK.That has always been the case, he says.He says, in talks with president Trump, he has spoken about defence and trade.

As the press conference was winding up in Brussels, Keir Starmer was asked by a reporter from the Sun if he broke lockdown rules during Covid by designating his voice coach as a key worker. Mark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was “silly” to suggest that Trump’s threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. When first asked if he had a message for the US and Denmark, in relation to the dispute over Greenland, Rutte at first suggested that Trump was doing the west a favour by highlight the security issues in that region. In response to a later question from ITV’s James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:
Your question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US – that is for so many reasons a silly thought …. He said:

When you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it’s very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US]. Starmer replied:
Look in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I’ve always been clear that both are important to us. That’s why, in my discussions with President Trump, we’ve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we’ve founded over many, many years …
Both of these relations are very important to us. Here is the full reply from Keir Starmer to a question Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, who asked him if, in the light of Donald Trump’s tariff threats, it was time to recognise that Trump was “a bad thing for Europe’s economic prosperity and security”. Starmer also said that the Ukraine war had led to Nato becoming “stronger and bigger”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Mark Rutte shaking hands at their press conference.

As the press conference was winding up in Brussels, Keir Starmer was asked by a reporter from the Sun if he broke lockdown rules during Covid by designating his voice coach as a key worker. Mark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was “silly” to suggest that Trump’s threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. In response to a later question from ITV’s James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:
Your question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US – that is for so many reasons a silly thought …. He said:

When you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it’s very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US]. Starmer replied:
Look in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I’ve always been clear that both are important to us. That’s why, in my discussions with President Trump, we’ve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we’ve founded over many, many years …
Both of these relations are very important to us. Here is the full reply from Keir Starmer to a question Beth Rigby, the Sky News political editor, who asked him if, in the light of Donald Trump’s tariff threats, it was time to recognise that Trump was “a bad thing for Europe’s economic prosperity and security”.

As the press conference was winding up in Brussels, Keir Starmer was asked by a reporter from the Sun if he broke lockdown rules during Covid by designating his voice coach as a key worker. Mark Rutte, the Nato general secretary, said it was “silly” to suggest that Trump’s threats to annex Greenland meant Europe should start considering how it could defend itself without relying on the US. In response to a later question from ITV’s James Mates, who pointed out that it was unprecented for one Nato member to threaten another in the way Trump has threatened Nato because he wants Greenland, Rutte said:
Your question about Nato and the assumption that you could run Nato without the US – that is for so many reasons a silly thought …. He said:

When you look at the defence industrial base, it is clearly it’s very clear that the US is selling much more into Europe than [Europe is selling to the US].

Look in relation to the relationship between the UK and the US and the EU, I’ve always been clear that both are important to us. That’s why, in my discussions with President Trump, we’ve touched on issues of trade and on issues of security, both in relation to the trade we already do between our two countries, but also the security, the defence and the intelligence partnership that we’ve founded over many, many years …
Both of these relations are very important to us. Starmer replied:

Q: [To Starmer] What happens if you are forced to choose between the US and the UK?Starmer says it is vital for the UK that it works with both Europe and the US. But equally on defense and security with the US and the special relationship in relation to defense and security
He also says the UK has a huge amount of trade with both the US and the EU. But equally on defense and security with the US and the special relationship in relation to defense and security

He also says the UK has a huge amount of trade with both the US and the EU. Doesn’t Europe have to start planning a way of defending itself in future without the US?Rutte says the idea of Nato without the US is a “silly thought”.He says he is a “staunch Atlanticist” and thinks the west has to stay connected.And he says he knows that thinking is still prevalent in the White House. Q: Will you water down the EU reset to keep Trump onside?Starmer says the US and the EU are both important to the UK.That has always been the case, he says.He says, in talks with president Trump, he has spoken about defence and trade. Starmer and Rutte are now taking quesions.Q: [To Rutte] Do you fear the Atlantic alliance is unravelling?Rutte says there are always issues between allies.He says the US sells more to Europe than Europe does to them.And he claims this issue will “not have an impact on our collective deterrence”.Q: [To Starmer] Trump is threatening allies. Isn’t he a bad thing for security?Starmer says, on tariffs, it is “early days’.He says it is “really important” to have “open and strong trading relations”.And he plays tribute to the role the US has played in relation to Ukraine.

This special report assesses new knowledge since the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) on how the ocean and cryosphere have and are expected to change with ongoing global warming, the risks and opportunities these changes bring to ecosystems and people, and mitigation, adaptation and governance options for reducing future risks. People in these regions face the greatest exposure to ocean and cryosphere change, and poor and marginalised people here are particularly vulnerable to climate-related hazards and risks (very high confidence). AR5 assessed that the ocean is warming (0 to 700 m: virtually certain2; 700 to 2,000 m: likely), sea level is rising (high confidence), and ocean acidity is increasing (high confidence). Most glaciers are shrinking (high confidence), the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass (high confidence), sea ice extent in the Arctic is decreasing (very high confidence), Northern Hemisphere snow cover is decreasing (very high confidence), and permafrost temperatures are increasing (high confidence). {1.1, 1.4, 1.8.1}
Evidence and understanding of the human causes of climate warming, and of associated ocean and cryosphere changes, has increased over the past 30 years of IPCC assessments (very high confidence). {1.1, 1.4}
Ocean and cryosphere changes and risks by the end-of-century (2081-2100) will be larger under high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, compared with low emission scenarios (very high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1} 
Characteristics of ocean and cryosphere change include thresholds of abrupt change, long-term changes that cannot be avoided, and irreversibility (high confidence). Societies will be exposed, and challenged to adapt, to changes in the ocean and cryosphere even if current and future efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions keep global warming well below 2°C (very high confidence). {1.6.1, 1.6.2, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1}
The scale and cross-boundary dimensions of changes in the ocean and cryosphere challenge the ability of communities, cultures and nations to respond effectively within existing governance frameworks (high confidence). Changes in the ocean and cryosphere, the ecosystem services that they provide, the drivers of those changes, and the risks to marine, coastal, polar and mountain ecosystems, occur on spatial and temporal scales that may not align within existing governance structures and practices (medium confidence). {1.5, 1.7, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1}
Robust assessments of ocean and cryosphere change, and the development of context-specific governance and response options, depend on utilising and strengthening all available knowledge systems (high confidence). {1.8, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1} 
Long-term sustained observations and continued modelling are critical for detecting, understanding and predicting ocean and cryosphere change, providing the knowledge to inform risk assessments and adaptation planning (high confidence). Knowledge gaps exist in scientific knowledge for important regions, parameters and processes of ocean and cryosphere change, including for physically plausible, high impact changes like high end sea level rise scenarios that would be costly if realised without effective adaptation planning and even then may exceed limits to to adaptation. {1.8.1, 1.9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1}

Chapter 2: High Mountain Areas
Executive Summary



 View
 Download
 Explore Graphics








The cryosphere (including, snow, glaciers, permafrost, lake and river ice) is an integral element of high mountain regions, which are home to roughly 10% of the global population. Observations of cryospheric changes, impacts, and adaptation in high mountain areas
Observations show general decline in low-elevation snow cover (high confidence1), glaciers (very high confidence) and permafrost (high confidence) due to climate change in recent decades. In some regions, snow avalanches involving wet snow have increased (medium confidence), and rain-on-snow floods have decreased at low elevations in spring and increased at high elevations in winter (medium confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}
Changes in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and seasonality of runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed river basins (very high confidence) with local impacts on water resources and agriculture (medium confidence). Glacier retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including the Hindu Kush Himalaya, and the tropical Andes (medium confidence). {2.3.1}
Species composition and abundance have markedly changed in high mountain ecosystems in recent decades (very high confidence), partly due to changes in the cryosphere (high confidence). Habitats for establishment by formerly absent species have opened up or been altered by reduced snow cover (high confidence), retreating glaciers (very high confidence), and thawing of permafrost (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5} 
Future projections of cryospheric changes, their impacts and risks, and adaptation in high mountain areas
Snow cover, glaciers and permafrost are projected to continue to decline in almost all regions throughout the 21st century (high confidence). In regions with mostly smaller glaciers and relatively little ice cover (e.g., European Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical Andes, Mexico, eastern Africa and Indonesia), glaciers will lose more than 80% of their current mass by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence), and many glaciers will disappear regardless emission scenario (very high confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}

River runoff in snow dominated and glacier-fed river basins will change further in amount and seasonality in response to projected snow cover and glacier decline (very high confidence) with negative impacts on agriculture, hydropower and water quality in some regions (medium confidence). The average winter snowmelt runoff is projected to increase (high confidence), and spring peaks to occur earlier (very high confidence). {2.3.1}
Current trends in cryosphere-related changes in high mountain ecosystems are expected to continue and impacts to intensify (very high confidence). While high mountains will provide new and greater habitat area, including refugia for lowland species, both range expansion and shrinkage are projected, and at high elevations this will lead to population declines (high confidence). Many projected ecological changes will alter ecosystem services (high confidence), affecting ecological disturbances (e.g., fire, rock fall, slope erosion) with considerable impacts on people (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}
Enablers and response options to promote adaptation and sustainable development in high mountain areas
The already committed and unavoidable climate change affecting all cryosphere elements, irrespective of the emission scenario, points to integrated adaptation planning to support and enhance water availability, access, and management (medium confidence). {3.2.1.2.4}
Both polar oceans have continued to warm in recent years, with the Southern Ocean being disproportionately and increasingly important in global ocean heat increase (high confidence). Over large sectors of the seasonally ice-free Arctic, summer upper mixed layer temperatures increased at around 0.5°C per decade during 1982–2017, primarily associated with increased absorbed solar radiation accompanying sea ice loss, and the inflow of ocean heat from lower latitude increased since the 2000s (high confidence). During 1970–2017, the Southern Ocean south of 30°S accounted for 35–43% of the global ocean heat gain in the upper 2000 m (high confidence), despite occupying ~25% of the global ocean area. In recent years (2005–2017), the Southern Ocean was responsible for an increased proportion of the global ocean heat increase (45–62%) (high confidence). {3.2.1.2.1}
Climate-induced changes in seasonal sea ice extent and thickness and ocean stratification are altering marine primary production (high confidence), with impacts on ecosystems (medium confidence). {3.2.1; 3.2.3, 3.2.4} 
In both polar regions, climate-induced changes in ocean and sea ice, together with human introduction of non-native species, have expanded the range of temperate species and contracted the range of polar fish and ice-associated species (high confidence). Arctic sea ice extent continues to decline in all months of the year (very high confidence); the strongest reductions in September (very likely –12.8 ± 2.3% per decade; 1979–2018) are unprecedented in at least 1000 years (medium confidence). While the drivers of historical decadal variability are known with medium confidence, there is currently limited evidence and low agreement concerning causes of the strong recent decrease (2016–2018), and low confidence in the ability of current-generation climate models to reproduce and explain the observations. Greater levels of Arctic ship-based transportation and tourism have socioeconomic and political implications for global trade, northern nations, and economies linked to traditional shipping corridors; they will also exacerbate region specific risks for marine ecosystems and coastal communities if further action to develop and adequately implement regulations does not keep pace with increased shipping (high confidence). {3.2.1.1; 3.2.4.2; 3.2.4.3; 3.4.3.3.2; 3.5.2.7}
Permafrost temperatures have increased to record high levels (very high confidence), but there is medium evidence and low agreement that this warming is currently causing northern permafrost regions to release additional methane and carbon dioxide. Summer melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) has increased since the 1990s (very high confidence) to a level unprecedented over at least the last 350 years, and two-to-fivefold the pre-industrial level (medium confidence). Antarctic ice loss is dominated by acceleration, retreat and rapid thinning of major West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) outlet glaciers (very high confidence), driven by melting of ice shelves by warm ocean waters (high confidence). For stabilised global warming of 1.5°C, an approximately 1% chance of a given September being sea ice free at the end of century is projected; for stabilised warming at a 2°C increase, this rises to 10–35% (high confidence). {3.2.2; 3.3.2; 3.4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2}
Both polar oceans will be increasingly affected by CO2 uptake, causing conditions corrosive for calcium carbonate shell-producing organisms (high confidence), with associated impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems (medium confidence). Continued loss of Arctic multi-year sea ice will affect ice-related and pelagic primary production (high confidence), with impacts for whole ice-associated, seafloor and open ocean ecosystems. By 2050, 70% of Arctic infrastructure is located in regions at risk from permafrost thaw and subsidence; adaptation measures taken in advance could reduce costs arising from thaw and other climate change related impacts such as increased flooding, precipitation, and freeze-thaw events by half (medium confidence). Responding to climate change in polar regions will be more effective if attention to reducing immediate risks (short-term adaptation) is concurrent with long-term planning that builds resilience to address expected and unexpected impacts (high confidence). {3.5.3}
The capacity of governance systems in polar regions to respond to climate change has strengthened recently, but the development of these systems is not sufficiently rapid or robust to address the challenges and risks to societies posed by projected changes (high confidence). Furthermore, the long (multi-millennial) time scales of these past climate and sea level changes, and regional climate influences from changes in Earth’s orbital configuration and climate system feedbacks, lead to low confidence in direct comparisons with near-term future changes. {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, 4.2.2, 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.5, SM 4.1}
Non-climatic anthropogenic drivers, including recent and historical demographic and settlement trends and anthropogenic subsidence, have played an important role in increasing low-lying coastal communities’ exposure and vulnerability to SLR and extreme sea level (ESL) events (very high confidence). {4.2.2.4, 4.3.1, 4.3.2.2,  4.3.2.3} 
Coastal ecosystems are already impacted by the combination of SLR, other climate-related ocean changes, and adverse effects from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). {4.3.3, 4.3.4}
A diversity of adaptation responses to coastal impacts and risks have been implemented around the world, but mostly as a reaction to current coastal risk or experienced disasters (high confidence). Beyond 2100, sea level will continue to rise for centuries due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass loss of the GIS and AIS and will remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence). {4.2.2.5, 4.2.3.4}
Non-climatic anthropogenic drivers will continue to increase the exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to future SLR and ESL events in the absence of major adaptation efforts compared to today (high confidence). While investments are generally cost efficient for densely populated and urban areas (high confidence), rural and poorer areas will be challenged to afford such investments with relative annual costs for some small island states amounting to several percent of GDP (high confidence). {4.3.4, 4.4.2.2, 4.4.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
Risk related to SLR (including erosion, flooding and salinisation) is expected to significantly increase by the end of this century along all low-lying coasts in the absence of major additional adaptation efforts (very high confidence). While only urban atoll islands and some Arctic communities are expected to experience moderate to high risk relative to today in a low emission pathway, almost high to very high risks are expected in all low-lying coastal settings at the upper end of the likely range for high emission pathways (medium confidence). However, the transition from moderate to high and from high to very high risk will vary from one coastal setting to another (high confidence). {4.4.2.2, 4.4.2.3, 4.4.2.4, 4.4.2.5, 4.4.2.6, 4.4.3}
Technical limits to hard protection are expected to be reached under high emission scenarios (RCP8.5) beyond 2100 (high confidence) and biophysical limits to EbA may arise during the 21st century, but economic and social barriers arise well before the end of the century (medium confidence). Choosing and implementing responses is further challenged through a lack of resources, vexing trade-offs between safety, conservation and economic development, multiple ways of framing the ‘sea level rise problem’, power relations, and various coastal stakeholders having conflicting interests in the future development of heavily used coastal zones (high confidence). Effective SLR responses depend, first, on taking a long-term perspective when making short-term decisions, explicitly accounting for uncertainty of locality-specific risks beyond 2050 (high confidence), and building governance capabilities to tackle the complexity of SLR risk (medium evidence, high agreement). Third, prioritising consideration of social vulnerability and equity underpins efforts to promote fair and just climate resilience and sustainable development (high confidence) and can be helped by creating safe community arenas for meaningful public deliberation and conflict resolution (medium evidence, high agreement). Observed warming and high-latitude freshening are making the surface ocean less dense over time relative to the deeper ocean (high confidence 2) and inhibiting the exchange between surface and deep waters. Evidence is growing that the ocean carbon sink is dynamic on decadal timescales, especially in the Southern Ocean, which has affected the total global ocean carbon sink (medium confidence). {5.2.2.4}
In response to ocean warming and increased stratification, open ocean nutrient cycles are being perturbed and there is high confidence that this is having a regionally variable impact on primary producers. {5.2.2.5, 5.2.2.6} 
Ocean warming has contributed to observed changes in biogeography of organisms ranging from phytoplankton to marine mammals (high confidence), consequently changing community composition (high confidence), and in some cases, altering interactions between organisms (medium confidence). Warming, sea level rise (SLR) and enhanced loads of nutrients and sediments in deltas have contributed to salinisation and deoxygenation in estuaries (high confidence), and have caused upstream redistribution of benthic and pelagic species according to their tolerance limits (medium confidence). Ocean warming and changes in primary production since the 20th century are related to changes in productivity of many fish stocks (high confidence), with an average decrease of approximately 3% per decade in population replenishment and 4.1% (very likely range of 9.0% decline to 0.3% increase) in maximum catch potential (robust evidence, low agreement between fish stocks, medium confidence). For existing international and national ocean and fisheries governance, there are concerns about the reduced effectiveness to achieve mandated ecological, economic, and social objectives because of observed climate impacts on fisheries resources (high confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.2}
Coastal ecosystems are observed to be under stress from ocean warming and SLR that are exacerbated by non-climatic pressures from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). Distributions of seagrass meadows and kelp forests are contracting at low-latitudes that is attributable to warming (high confidence), and in some areas a loss of 36–43% following heat waves (medium confidence). Sessile calcified organisms (e.g., barnacles and mussels) in intertidal rocky shores are highly sensitive to extreme temperature events and acidification (high confidence), a reduction in their biodiversity and abundance have been observed in naturally-acidified rocky reef ecosystems (medium confidence). Increasing trends in ocean acidification in the California Current EBUS and deoxygenation in California Current and Humboldt Current EBUS are observed in the last few decades (high confidence), although there is low confidence to distinguish anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. {Box 5.3} 
Since the early 1980s, the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) and pathogenic organisms (e.g., Vibrio) has increased in coastal areas in response to warming, deoxygenation and eutrophication, with negative impacts on food provisioning, tourism, the economy and human health (high confidence). Under the high emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5) the impacts by 2090 are substantially larger and more widespread than for the low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) throughout the surface and deep ocean, including: warming (virtually certain); ocean acidification (virtually certain); decreased stability of mineral forms of calcite (virtually certain); oxygen loss (very likely); reduced near-surface nutrients (likely as not); decreased net primary productivity (high confidence); reduced fish production (likely) and loss of key ecosystems services (medium confidence) that are important for human well-being and sustainable development. The 0–2000 m layer is projected to warm by 900 ZJ (very likely range 650–1340 ZJ) by 2100 for the RCP2.6 scenario, and the overall warming of the ocean will continue this century even after radiative forcing and mean surface temperatures stabilise (high confidence). There is increasing evidence of an increase in the seasonal exposure to acidified conditions in the future (high confidence), with a very likely increase in the amplitude of seasonal cycle of hydrogen iron concentrations of 71–90% by 2100, relative to 2000 for the RCP8.5 scenario, especially at high latitudes. Globally, the sinking flux of organic matter from the upper ocean into the ocean interior is very likely to decrease by 9–16% for RCP8.5 in response to increased stratification and reduced nutrient supply, especially in tropical regions (medium confidence), which will reduce organic carbon supply to deep sea ecosystems (high confidence). {Box 5.1, Box 5.1 Figure 1} 
Simulated ocean warming and changes in NPP during the 21st century are projected to alter community structure of marine organisms (high confidence), reduce global marine animal biomass (medium confidence) and the maximum potential catches of fish stocks (medium confidence) with regional differences in the direction and magnitude of changes (high confidence). Projected climate change impacts on fisheries also increase the risk of potential conflicts among fishery area users and authorities or among two different communities within the same country (medium confidence), exacerbated through competing resource exploitation from international actors and mal-adapted policies (low confidence). {5.2.4}
Structure and functions of all types of coastal ecosystems will continue to be at moderate to high risk under the RCP2.6 scenario (medium confidence) and will face high to very high risk under the RCP8.5 scenario (high confidence) by 2100. Seagrass meadows (high confidence) and kelp forests (high confidence) will face moderate to high risk at temperature above 1.5oC global sea surface warming. Coral reefs will face very high risk at temperatures 1.5°C of global sea surface warming (very high confidence). Intertidal rocky shores will continue to be affected by ocean acidification, warming, and extreme heat exposure during low tide emersion, causing reduction of calcareous species and loss of ecosystem biodiversity and complexity shifting towards algae dominated habitats (high confidence). {5.3, 5.4.1}
Almost all coral reefs will degrade from their current state, even if global warming remains below 2ᴼC (very high confidence), and the remaining shallow coral reef communities will differ in species composition and diversity from present reefs (very high confidence). These declines in coral reef health will greatly diminish the services they provide to society, such as food provision (high confidence), coastal protection (high confidence) and tourism (medium confidence). The Pacific EBUS are projected to have calcium carbonate undersaturation in surface waters within a few decades under RCP8.5 (high confidence); combined with warming and decreasing oxygen levels, this will increase the impacts on shellfish larvae, benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes (high confidence) and related fisheries and aquaculture (medium confidence). The inherent natural variability of EBUS, together with uncertainties in present and future trends in the intensity and seasonality of upwelling, coastal warming and stratification, primary production and biogeochemistry of source waters poses large challenges in projecting the response of EBUS to climate change and to the adaptation of governance of biodiversity conservation and living marine resources in EBUS (high confidence). {5.4.2} 
Climate change increases the exposure and bioaccumulation of contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and mercury (medium confidence), and their risk of impacts on marine ecosystems and seafood safety (high agreement, medium evidence, medium confidence). Such risks are particularly large for top predators and for human communities that have high consumption on these organisms, including coastal Indigenous communities (medium confidence). These fishery governance related risks are widespread under high emissions scenarios with regional hotspots (medium confidence), and highlight the limits of existing natural resource management frameworks for addressing ecosystem change (high confidence). Ecosystem restoration may be able to locally reduce climate risks (medium confidence) but at relatively high cost and effectiveness limited to low emissions scenarios and to less sensitive systems (high confidence). Conservation of these habitats would also sustain the wide range of ecosystem services they provide and assist with climate adaptation through improving critical habitats for biodiversity, enhancing local fisheries production, and protecting coastal communities from SLR and storm events (high confidence). Other human interventions to enhance marine carbon uptake, for example, ocean alkalinisation (enhanced weathering), would also have governance challenges, with the increased risk of undesirable ecological consequences (high confidence). Hard engineering responses are more effective when supported by ecosystem-based adaptation approaches (high agreement), and both approaches are enhanced by combining with socioinstitutional approaches for adaptation (high confidence). {5.5.2.1}
Socioinstitutional adaptation responses, including community-based adaptation, capacity-building, participatory processes, institutional support for adaptation planning and support mechanisms for communities are important tools to address climate change impacts (high confidence). However, the effectiveness of these approaches to increase resilience to climate stressors and their large-scale implementation for reef restoration will be limited unless warming and ocean acidification are rapidly controlled (high confidence). {5.5.3}
There are a broad range of identified barriers and limits for adaptation to climate change in ecosystems and human systems (high confidence). Limitations include the space that ecosystems require, non-climatic drivers and human impacts that need to be addressed as part of the adaptation response, the lowering of adaptive capacity of ecosystems because of climate change, and the slower ecosystem recovery rates relative to the recurrence of climate impacts, availability of technology, knowledge and financial support and existing governance structures (medium confidence). It is not comprehensive in terms of the systems assessed and some information on extremes, abrupt and irreversible changes, in particular for the cryosphere, may be found in other chapters
Ongoing and Emerging Changes in the Ocean and Cryosphere, and their Impacts on Ecosystems and Human Societies
Anthropogenic climate change has increased observed precipitation (medium confidence), winds (low confidence), and extreme sea level events (high confidence) associated with some tropical cyclones, which has increased intensity of multiple extreme events and associated cascading impacts (high confidence). Changes in Arctic sea ice have the potential to influence mid-latitude weather (medium confidence), but there is low confidence in the detection of this influence for specific weather types. {6.3}



Marine heatwaves (MHWs), periods of extremely high ocean temperatures, have negatively impacted marine organisms and ecosystems in all ocean basins over the last two decades, including critical foundation species such as corals, seagrasses and kelps (very high confidence). In the last two decades, total water transport from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean by the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), and the Indian Ocean to Atlantic Ocean has increased (high confidence). {6.8, Box 6.1}
Projections of Ocean and Cryosphere Change and Hazards to Ecosystems and Human Society Under Low and High Emission Futures
The average intensity of tropical cyclones, the proportion of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones and the associated average precipitation rates are projected to increase for a 2°C global temperature rise above any baseline period (medium confidence). {6.3.1}
Significant wave heights (the average height from trough to crest of the highest one-third of waves) are projected to increase across the Southern Ocean and tropical eastern Pacific (high confidence) and Baltic Sea (medium confidence) and decrease over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea under RCP8.5 (high confidence). Projected changes in waves arising from changes in weather patterns, and changes in tides due to sea level rise, can locally enhance or ameliorate coastal hazards (medium confidence). {6.6, Figure 6.7}
The AMOC will very likely weaken over the 21st century (high confidence), although a collapse is very unlikely (medium confidence). {6.9.2}
Strengthening the Global Responses in the Context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Charting Climate Resilient Development Pathways for Oceans and Cryosphere 
There is medium confidence that including extremes and abrupt changes, such as AMOC weakening, ice sheet collapse (West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS)), leads to a several-fold increase in the cost of carbon emissions (medium confidence). {6.3, 6.9}
Limiting global warming would reduce the risk of impacts of MHWs, but critical thresholds for some ecosystems (e.g., kelp forests, coral reefs) will be reached at relatively low levels of future global warming (high confidence). {6.9}
Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction require capacity building and an integrated approach to ensure trade-offs between short- and long-term gains in dealing with the uncertainty of increasing extreme events, abrupt changes and cascading impacts at different geographic scales (high confidence). {6.9}
Limiting the risk from the impact of extreme events and abrupt changes leads to successful adaptation to climate change with the presence of well-coordinated climate-affected sectors and disaster management relevant agencies (high confidence). Depending on the effectiveness of 21st century mitigation and adaptation pathways under all emission scenarios, most of the low-lying regions around the world may face adaptation limits beyond 2100, due to the long-term commitment of sea level rise (medium confidence). LLIC already experience climate-related ocean and cryosphere changes (high confidence), and they share both commonalities in their exposure and vulnerability to climate change (e.g., low elevation, human disturbances to terrestrial and marine ecosystems), and context-specificities (e.g., variable ecosystem climate sensitivities and risk perceptions by populations). Effective combinations of measures vary across geographies (cities and megacities, small islands, deltas and Arctic coasts), and reflect the scale of observed and projected impacts, ecosystems’ and societies’ adaptive capacity, and the existence of transformational governance (high confidence) {Sections 3.5.3, 4.4.2 to 4.4.5, 5.5.2, 6.8, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1}. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. Glossary

This special report assesses new knowledge since the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) on how the ocean and cryosphere have and are expected to change with ongoing global warming, the risks and opportunities these changes bring to ecosystems and people, and mitigation, adaptation and governance options for reducing future risks. People in these regions face the greatest exposure to ocean and cryosphere change, and poor and marginalised people here are particularly vulnerable to climate-related hazards and risks (very high confidence). AR5 assessed that the ocean is warming (0 to 700 m: virtually certain2; 700 to 2,000 m: likely), sea level is rising (high confidence), and ocean acidity is increasing (high confidence). Most glaciers are shrinking (high confidence), the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass (high confidence), sea ice extent in the Arctic is decreasing (very high confidence), Northern Hemisphere snow cover is decreasing (very high confidence), and permafrost temperatures are increasing (high confidence). {1.1, 1.4, 1.8.1}
Evidence and understanding of the human causes of climate warming, and of associated ocean and cryosphere changes, has increased over the past 30 years of IPCC assessments (very high confidence). {1.1, 1.4}
Ocean and cryosphere changes and risks by the end-of-century (2081-2100) will be larger under high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, compared with low emission scenarios (very high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1} 
Characteristics of ocean and cryosphere change include thresholds of abrupt change, long-term changes that cannot be avoided, and irreversibility (high confidence). Societies will be exposed, and challenged to adapt, to changes in the ocean and cryosphere even if current and future efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions keep global warming well below 2°C (very high confidence). {1.6.1, 1.6.2, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1}
The scale and cross-boundary dimensions of changes in the ocean and cryosphere challenge the ability of communities, cultures and nations to respond effectively within existing governance frameworks (high confidence). Changes in the ocean and cryosphere, the ecosystem services that they provide, the drivers of those changes, and the risks to marine, coastal, polar and mountain ecosystems, occur on spatial and temporal scales that may not align within existing governance structures and practices (medium confidence). {1.5, 1.7, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1}
Robust assessments of ocean and cryosphere change, and the development of context-specific governance and response options, depend on utilising and strengthening all available knowledge systems (high confidence). {1.8, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1} 
Long-term sustained observations and continued modelling are critical for detecting, understanding and predicting ocean and cryosphere change, providing the knowledge to inform risk assessments and adaptation planning (high confidence). Knowledge gaps exist in scientific knowledge for important regions, parameters and processes of ocean and cryosphere change, including for physically plausible, high impact changes like high end sea level rise scenarios that would be costly if realised without effective adaptation planning and even then may exceed limits to to adaptation. {1.8.1, 1.9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1}

Chapter 2: High Mountain Areas
Executive Summary

 Explore Graphics








The cryosphere (including, snow, glaciers, permafrost, lake and river ice) is an integral element of high mountain regions, which are home to roughly 10% of the global population. Observations of cryospheric changes, impacts, and adaptation in high mountain areas
Observations show general decline in low-elevation snow cover (high confidence1), glaciers (very high confidence) and permafrost (high confidence) due to climate change in recent decades. In some regions, snow avalanches involving wet snow have increased (medium confidence), and rain-on-snow floods have decreased at low elevations in spring and increased at high elevations in winter (medium confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}
Changes in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and seasonality of runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed river basins (very high confidence) with local impacts on water resources and agriculture (medium confidence). Glacier retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including the Hindu Kush Himalaya, and the tropical Andes (medium confidence). {2.3.1}
Species composition and abundance have markedly changed in high mountain ecosystems in recent decades (very high confidence), partly due to changes in the cryosphere (high confidence). Habitats for establishment by formerly absent species have opened up or been altered by reduced snow cover (high confidence), retreating glaciers (very high confidence), and thawing of permafrost (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5} 
Future projections of cryospheric changes, their impacts and risks, and adaptation in high mountain areas
Snow cover, glaciers and permafrost are projected to continue to decline in almost all regions throughout the 21st century (high confidence). In regions with mostly smaller glaciers and relatively little ice cover (e.g., European Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical Andes, Mexico, eastern Africa and Indonesia), glaciers will lose more than 80% of their current mass by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence), and many glaciers will disappear regardless emission scenario (very high confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}

River runoff in snow dominated and glacier-fed river basins will change further in amount and seasonality in response to projected snow cover and glacier decline (very high confidence) with negative impacts on agriculture, hydropower and water quality in some regions (medium confidence). The average winter snowmelt runoff is projected to increase (high confidence), and spring peaks to occur earlier (very high confidence). {2.3.1}
Current trends in cryosphere-related changes in high mountain ecosystems are expected to continue and impacts to intensify (very high confidence). While high mountains will provide new and greater habitat area, including refugia for lowland species, both range expansion and shrinkage are projected, and at high elevations this will lead to population declines (high confidence). Many projected ecological changes will alter ecosystem services (high confidence), affecting ecological disturbances (e.g., fire, rock fall, slope erosion) with considerable impacts on people (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}
Enablers and response options to promote adaptation and sustainable development in high mountain areas
The already committed and unavoidable climate change affecting all cryosphere elements, irrespective of the emission scenario, points to integrated adaptation planning to support and enhance water availability, access, and management (medium confidence). Observations of cryospheric changes, impacts, and adaptation in high mountain areas
Observations show general decline in low-elevation snow cover (high confidence1), glaciers (very high confidence) and permafrost (high confidence) due to climate change in recent decades. In some regions, snow avalanches involving wet snow have increased (medium confidence), and rain-on-snow floods have decreased at low elevations in spring and increased at high elevations in winter (medium confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}

In regions with mostly smaller glaciers and relatively little ice cover (e.g., European Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical Andes, Mexico, eastern Africa and Indonesia), glaciers will lose more than 80% of their current mass by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence), and many glaciers will disappear regardless emission scenario (very high confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}

River runoff in snow dominated and glacier-fed river basins will change further in amount and seasonality in response to projected snow cover and glacier decline (very high confidence) with negative impacts on agriculture, hydropower and water quality in some regions (medium confidence). The average winter snowmelt runoff is projected to increase (high confidence), and spring peaks to occur earlier (very high confidence). {2.3.1}
Current trends in cryosphere-related changes in high mountain ecosystems are expected to continue and impacts to intensify (very high confidence). While high mountains will provide new and greater habitat area, including refugia for lowland species, both range expansion and shrinkage are projected, and at high elevations this will lead to population declines (high confidence). Many projected ecological changes will alter ecosystem services (high confidence), affecting ecological disturbances (e.g., fire, rock fall, slope erosion) with considerable impacts on people (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}
Enablers and response options to promote adaptation and sustainable development in high mountain areas
The already committed and unavoidable climate change affecting all cryosphere elements, irrespective of the emission scenario, points to integrated adaptation planning to support and enhance water availability, access, and management (medium confidence). Observations of cryospheric changes, impacts, and adaptation in high mountain areas
Observations show general decline in low-elevation snow cover (high confidence1), glaciers (very high confidence) and permafrost (high confidence) due to climate change in recent decades. In some regions, snow avalanches involving wet snow have increased (medium confidence), and rain-on-snow floods have decreased at low elevations in spring and increased at high elevations in winter (medium confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}
Changes in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and seasonality of runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed river basins (very high confidence) with local impacts on water resources and agriculture (medium confidence). Glacier retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including the Hindu Kush Himalaya, and the tropical Andes (medium confidence). {2.3.1}
Species composition and abundance have markedly changed in high mountain ecosystems in recent decades (very high confidence), partly due to changes in the cryosphere (high confidence). Habitats for establishment by formerly absent species have opened up or been altered by reduced snow cover (high confidence), retreating glaciers (very high confidence), and thawing of permafrost (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5}

The already committed and unavoidable climate change affecting all cryosphere elements, irrespective of the emission scenario, points to integrated adaptation planning to support and enhance water availability, access, and management (medium confidence). {3.2.1.2.4}
Both polar oceans have continued to warm in recent years, with the Southern Ocean being disproportionately and increasingly important in global ocean heat increase (high confidence). Over large sectors of the seasonally ice-free Arctic, summer upper mixed layer temperatures increased at around 0.5°C per decade during 1982–2017, primarily associated with increased absorbed solar radiation accompanying sea ice loss, and the inflow of ocean heat from lower latitude increased since the 2000s (high confidence). During 1970–2017, the Southern Ocean south of 30°S accounted for 35–43% of the global ocean heat gain in the upper 2000 m (high confidence), despite occupying ~25% of the global ocean area. In recent years (2005–2017), the Southern Ocean was responsible for an increased proportion of the global ocean heat increase (45–62%) (high confidence). {3.2.1.2.1}
Climate-induced changes in seasonal sea ice extent and thickness and ocean stratification are altering marine primary production (high confidence), with impacts on ecosystems (medium confidence). {3.2.1; 3.2.3, 3.2.4} 
In both polar regions, climate-induced changes in ocean and sea ice, together with human introduction of non-native species, have expanded the range of temperate species and contracted the range of polar fish and ice-associated species (high confidence). Arctic sea ice extent continues to decline in all months of the year (very high confidence); the strongest reductions in September (very likely –12.8 ± 2.3% per decade; 1979–2018) are unprecedented in at least 1000 years (medium confidence). While the drivers of historical decadal variability are known with medium confidence, there is currently limited evidence and low agreement concerning causes of the strong recent decrease (2016–2018), and low confidence in the ability of current-generation climate models to reproduce and explain the observations. Greater levels of Arctic ship-based transportation and tourism have socioeconomic and political implications for global trade, northern nations, and economies linked to traditional shipping corridors; they will also exacerbate region specific risks for marine ecosystems and coastal communities if further action to develop and adequately implement regulations does not keep pace with increased shipping (high confidence). {3.2.1.1; 3.2.4.2; 3.2.4.3; 3.4.3.3.2; 3.5.2.7}
Permafrost temperatures have increased to record high levels (very high confidence), but there is medium evidence and low agreement that this warming is currently causing northern permafrost regions to release additional methane and carbon dioxide. Summer melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) has increased since the 1990s (very high confidence) to a level unprecedented over at least the last 350 years, and two-to-fivefold the pre-industrial level (medium confidence). Antarctic ice loss is dominated by acceleration, retreat and rapid thinning of major West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) outlet glaciers (very high confidence), driven by melting of ice shelves by warm ocean waters (high confidence). For stabilised global warming of 1.5°C, an approximately 1% chance of a given September being sea ice free at the end of century is projected; for stabilised warming at a 2°C increase, this rises to 10–35% (high confidence). {3.2.2; 3.3.2; 3.4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2}
Both polar oceans will be increasingly affected by CO2 uptake, causing conditions corrosive for calcium carbonate shell-producing organisms (high confidence), with associated impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems (medium confidence). Continued loss of Arctic multi-year sea ice will affect ice-related and pelagic primary production (high confidence), with impacts for whole ice-associated, seafloor and open ocean ecosystems. By 2050, 70% of Arctic infrastructure is located in regions at risk from permafrost thaw and subsidence; adaptation measures taken in advance could reduce costs arising from thaw and other climate change related impacts such as increased flooding, precipitation, and freeze-thaw events by half (medium confidence). Responding to climate change in polar regions will be more effective if attention to reducing immediate risks (short-term adaptation) is concurrent with long-term planning that builds resilience to address expected and unexpected impacts (high confidence). {3.5.3}
The capacity of governance systems in polar regions to respond to climate change has strengthened recently, but the development of these systems is not sufficiently rapid or robust to address the challenges and risks to societies posed by projected changes (high confidence). {3.2.1.2.4}

Arctic sea ice extent continues to decline in all months of the year (very high confidence); the strongest reductions in September (very likely –12.8 ± 2.3% per decade; 1979–2018) are unprecedented in at least 1000 years (medium confidence). While the drivers of historical decadal variability are known with medium confidence, there is currently limited evidence and low agreement concerning causes of the strong recent decrease (2016–2018), and low confidence in the ability of current-generation climate models to reproduce and explain the observations. Greater levels of Arctic ship-based transportation and tourism have socioeconomic and political implications for global trade, northern nations, and economies linked to traditional shipping corridors; they will also exacerbate region specific risks for marine ecosystems and coastal communities if further action to develop and adequately implement regulations does not keep pace with increased shipping (high confidence). {3.2.1.1; 3.2.4.2; 3.2.4.3; 3.4.3.3.2; 3.5.2.7}
Permafrost temperatures have increased to record high levels (very high confidence), but there is medium evidence and low agreement that this warming is currently causing northern permafrost regions to release additional methane and carbon dioxide. Summer melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) has increased since the 1990s (very high confidence) to a level unprecedented over at least the last 350 years, and two-to-fivefold the pre-industrial level (medium confidence). Antarctic ice loss is dominated by acceleration, retreat and rapid thinning of major West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) outlet glaciers (very high confidence), driven by melting of ice shelves by warm ocean waters (high confidence). For stabilised global warming of 1.5°C, an approximately 1% chance of a given September being sea ice free at the end of century is projected; for stabilised warming at a 2°C increase, this rises to 10–35% (high confidence). {3.2.2; 3.3.2; 3.4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2}
Both polar oceans will be increasingly affected by CO2 uptake, causing conditions corrosive for calcium carbonate shell-producing organisms (high confidence), with associated impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems (medium confidence). Continued loss of Arctic multi-year sea ice will affect ice-related and pelagic primary production (high confidence), with impacts for whole ice-associated, seafloor and open ocean ecosystems. By 2050, 70% of Arctic infrastructure is located in regions at risk from permafrost thaw and subsidence; adaptation measures taken in advance could reduce costs arising from thaw and other climate change related impacts such as increased flooding, precipitation, and freeze-thaw events by half (medium confidence). Responding to climate change in polar regions will be more effective if attention to reducing immediate risks (short-term adaptation) is concurrent with long-term planning that builds resilience to address expected and unexpected impacts (high confidence). {3.5.3}
The capacity of governance systems in polar regions to respond to climate change has strengthened recently, but the development of these systems is not sufficiently rapid or robust to address the challenges and risks to societies posed by projected changes (high confidence). {3.2.1.2.4}

Both polar oceans have continued to warm in recent years, with the Southern Ocean being disproportionately and increasingly important in global ocean heat increase (high confidence). Over large sectors of the seasonally ice-free Arctic, summer upper mixed layer temperatures increased at around 0.5°C per decade during 1982–2017, primarily associated with increased absorbed solar radiation accompanying sea ice loss, and the inflow of ocean heat from lower latitude increased since the 2000s (high confidence). During 1970–2017, the Southern Ocean south of 30°S accounted for 35–43% of the global ocean heat gain in the upper 2000 m (high confidence), despite occupying ~25% of the global ocean area. In recent years (2005–2017), the Southern Ocean was responsible for an increased proportion of the global ocean heat increase (45–62%) (high confidence). {3.2.1.2.1}

Both polar oceans will be increasingly affected by CO2 uptake, causing conditions corrosive for calcium carbonate shell-producing organisms (high confidence), with associated impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems (medium confidence). Continued loss of Arctic multi-year sea ice will affect ice-related and pelagic primary production (high confidence), with impacts for whole ice-associated, seafloor and open ocean ecosystems.

The capacity of governance systems in polar regions to respond to climate change has strengthened recently, but the development of these systems is not sufficiently rapid or robust to address the challenges and risks to societies posed by projected changes (high confidence). Furthermore, the long (multi-millennial) time scales of these past climate and sea level changes, and regional climate influences from changes in Earth’s orbital configuration and climate system feedbacks, lead to low confidence in direct comparisons with near-term future changes. {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, 4.2.2, 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.5, SM 4.1}
Non-climatic anthropogenic drivers, including recent and historical demographic and settlement trends and anthropogenic subsidence, have played an important role in increasing low-lying coastal communities’ exposure and vulnerability to SLR and extreme sea level (ESL) events (very high confidence). {4.2.2.4, 4.3.1, 4.3.2.2,  4.3.2.3} 
Coastal ecosystems are already impacted by the combination of SLR, other climate-related ocean changes, and adverse effects from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). {4.3.3, 4.3.4}
A diversity of adaptation responses to coastal impacts and risks have been implemented around the world, but mostly as a reaction to current coastal risk or experienced disasters (high confidence). Beyond 2100, sea level will continue to rise for centuries due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass loss of the GIS and AIS and will remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence). {4.2.2.5, 4.2.3.4}
Non-climatic anthropogenic drivers will continue to increase the exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to future SLR and ESL events in the absence of major adaptation efforts compared to today (high confidence). While investments are generally cost efficient for densely populated and urban areas (high confidence), rural and poorer areas will be challenged to afford such investments with relative annual costs for some small island states amounting to several percent of GDP (high confidence). {4.3.4, 4.4.2.2, 4.4.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
Risk related to SLR (including erosion, flooding and salinisation) is expected to significantly increase by the end of this century along all low-lying coasts in the absence of major additional adaptation efforts (very high confidence). While only urban atoll islands and some Arctic communities are expected to experience moderate to high risk relative to today in a low emission pathway, almost high to very high risks are expected in all low-lying coastal settings at the upper end of the likely range for high emission pathways (medium confidence). However, the transition from moderate to high and from high to very high risk will vary from one coastal setting to another (high confidence). {4.4.2.2, 4.4.2.3, 4.4.2.4, 4.4.2.5, 4.4.2.6, 4.4.3}
Technical limits to hard protection are expected to be reached under high emission scenarios (RCP8.5) beyond 2100 (high confidence) and biophysical limits to EbA may arise during the 21st century, but economic and social barriers arise well before the end of the century (medium confidence). Choosing and implementing responses is further challenged through a lack of resources, vexing trade-offs between safety, conservation and economic development, multiple ways of framing the ‘sea level rise problem’, power relations, and various coastal stakeholders having conflicting interests in the future development of heavily used coastal zones (high confidence). Effective SLR responses depend, first, on taking a long-term perspective when making short-term decisions, explicitly accounting for uncertainty of locality-specific risks beyond 2050 (high confidence), and building governance capabilities to tackle the complexity of SLR risk (medium evidence, high agreement). Third, prioritising consideration of social vulnerability and equity underpins efforts to promote fair and just climate resilience and sustainable development (high confidence) and can be helped by creating safe community arenas for meaningful public deliberation and conflict resolution (medium evidence, high agreement).

Warming, sea level rise (SLR) and enhanced loads of nutrients and sediments in deltas have contributed to salinisation and deoxygenation in estuaries (high confidence), and have caused upstream redistribution of benthic and pelagic species according to their tolerance limits (medium confidence). Ocean warming and changes in primary production since the 20th century are related to changes in productivity of many fish stocks (high confidence), with an average decrease of approximately 3% per decade in population replenishment and 4.1% (very likely range of 9.0% decline to 0.3% increase) in maximum catch potential (robust evidence, low agreement between fish stocks, medium confidence). For existing international and national ocean and fisheries governance, there are concerns about the reduced effectiveness to achieve mandated ecological, economic, and social objectives because of observed climate impacts on fisheries resources (high confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.2}
Coastal ecosystems are observed to be under stress from ocean warming and SLR that are exacerbated by non-climatic pressures from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). Distributions of seagrass meadows and kelp forests are contracting at low-latitudes that is attributable to warming (high confidence), and in some areas a loss of 36–43% following heat waves (medium confidence). Sessile calcified organisms (e.g., barnacles and mussels) in intertidal rocky shores are highly sensitive to extreme temperature events and acidification (high confidence), a reduction in their biodiversity and abundance have been observed in naturally-acidified rocky reef ecosystems (medium confidence). Increasing trends in ocean acidification in the California Current EBUS and deoxygenation in California Current and Humboldt Current EBUS are observed in the last few decades (high confidence), although there is low confidence to distinguish anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. {Box 5.3} 
Since the early 1980s, the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) and pathogenic organisms (e.g., Vibrio) has increased in coastal areas in response to warming, deoxygenation and eutrophication, with negative impacts on food provisioning, tourism, the economy and human health (high confidence). Under the high emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5) the impacts by 2090 are substantially larger and more widespread than for the low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) throughout the surface and deep ocean, including: warming (virtually certain); ocean acidification (virtually certain); decreased stability of mineral forms of calcite (virtually certain); oxygen loss (very likely); reduced near-surface nutrients (likely as not); decreased net primary productivity (high confidence); reduced fish production (likely) and loss of key ecosystems services (medium confidence) that are important for human well-being and sustainable development. The 0–2000 m layer is projected to warm by 900 ZJ (very likely range 650–1340 ZJ) by 2100 for the RCP2.6 scenario, and the overall warming of the ocean will continue this century even after radiative forcing and mean surface temperatures stabilise (high confidence). There is increasing evidence of an increase in the seasonal exposure to acidified conditions in the future (high confidence), with a very likely increase in the amplitude of seasonal cycle of hydrogen iron concentrations of 71–90% by 2100, relative to 2000 for the RCP8.5 scenario, especially at high latitudes. Globally, the sinking flux of organic matter from the upper ocean into the ocean interior is very likely to decrease by 9–16% for RCP8.5 in response to increased stratification and reduced nutrient supply, especially in tropical regions (medium confidence), which will reduce organic carbon supply to deep sea ecosystems (high confidence). {Box 5.1, Box 5.1 Figure 1} 
Simulated ocean warming and changes in NPP during the 21st century are projected to alter community structure of marine organisms (high confidence), reduce global marine animal biomass (medium confidence) and the maximum potential catches of fish stocks (medium confidence) with regional differences in the direction and magnitude of changes (high confidence). Projected climate change impacts on fisheries also increase the risk of potential conflicts among fishery area users and authorities or among two different communities within the same country (medium confidence), exacerbated through competing resource exploitation from international actors and mal-adapted policies (low confidence). {5.2.4}
Structure and functions of all types of coastal ecosystems will continue to be at moderate to high risk under the RCP2.6 scenario (medium confidence) and will face high to very high risk under the RCP8.5 scenario (high confidence) by 2100. Seagrass meadows (high confidence) and kelp forests (high confidence) will face moderate to high risk at temperature above 1.5oC global sea surface warming. Coral reefs will face very high risk at temperatures 1.5°C of global sea surface warming (very high confidence). Intertidal rocky shores will continue to be affected by ocean acidification, warming, and extreme heat exposure during low tide emersion, causing reduction of calcareous species and loss of ecosystem biodiversity and complexity shifting towards algae dominated habitats (high confidence). {5.3, 5.4.1}
Almost all coral reefs will degrade from their current state, even if global warming remains below 2ᴼC (very high confidence), and the remaining shallow coral reef communities will differ in species composition and diversity from present reefs (very high confidence). These declines in coral reef health will greatly diminish the services they provide to society, such as food provision (high confidence), coastal protection (high confidence) and tourism (medium confidence). The Pacific EBUS are projected to have calcium carbonate undersaturation in surface waters within a few decades under RCP8.5 (high confidence); combined with warming and decreasing oxygen levels, this will increase the impacts on shellfish larvae, benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes (high confidence) and related fisheries and aquaculture (medium confidence). The inherent natural variability of EBUS, together with uncertainties in present and future trends in the intensity and seasonality of upwelling, coastal warming and stratification, primary production and biogeochemistry of source waters poses large challenges in projecting the response of EBUS to climate change and to the adaptation of governance of biodiversity conservation and living marine resources in EBUS (high confidence). {5.4.2} 
Climate change increases the exposure and bioaccumulation of contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and mercury (medium confidence), and their risk of impacts on marine ecosystems and seafood safety (high agreement, medium evidence, medium confidence). Such risks are particularly large for top predators and for human communities that have high consumption on these organisms, including coastal Indigenous communities (medium confidence). These fishery governance related risks are widespread under high emissions scenarios with regional hotspots (medium confidence), and highlight the limits of existing natural resource management frameworks for addressing ecosystem change (high confidence). Ecosystem restoration may be able to locally reduce climate risks (medium confidence) but at relatively high cost and effectiveness limited to low emissions scenarios and to less sensitive systems (high confidence). Conservation of these habitats would also sustain the wide range of ecosystem services they provide and assist with climate adaptation through improving critical habitats for biodiversity, enhancing local fisheries production, and protecting coastal communities from SLR and storm events (high confidence). Other human interventions to enhance marine carbon uptake, for example, ocean alkalinisation (enhanced weathering), would also have governance challenges, with the increased risk of undesirable ecological consequences (high confidence). Hard engineering responses are more effective when supported by ecosystem-based adaptation approaches (high agreement), and both approaches are enhanced by combining with socioinstitutional approaches for adaptation (high confidence). {5.5.2.1}
Socioinstitutional adaptation responses, including community-based adaptation, capacity-building, participatory processes, institutional support for adaptation planning and support mechanisms for communities are important tools to address climate change impacts (high confidence). However, the effectiveness of these approaches to increase resilience to climate stressors and their large-scale implementation for reef restoration will be limited unless warming and ocean acidification are rapidly controlled (high confidence). {5.5.3}
There are a broad range of identified barriers and limits for adaptation to climate change in ecosystems and human systems (high confidence). Limitations include the space that ecosystems require, non-climatic drivers and human impacts that need to be addressed as part of the adaptation response, the lowering of adaptive capacity of ecosystems because of climate change, and the slower ecosystem recovery rates relative to the recurrence of climate impacts, availability of technology, knowledge and financial support and existing governance structures (medium confidence). Observed warming and high-latitude freshening are making the surface ocean less dense over time relative to the deeper ocean (high confidence 2) and inhibiting the exchange between surface and deep waters. Evidence is growing that the ocean carbon sink is dynamic on decadal timescales, especially in the Southern Ocean, which has affected the total global ocean carbon sink (medium confidence). {5.2.2.4}

Ocean warming has contributed to observed changes in biogeography of organisms ranging from phytoplankton to marine mammals (high confidence), consequently changing community composition (high confidence), and in some cases, altering interactions between organisms (medium confidence). Warming, sea level rise (SLR) and enhanced loads of nutrients and sediments in deltas have contributed to salinisation and deoxygenation in estuaries (high confidence), and have caused upstream redistribution of benthic and pelagic species according to their tolerance limits (medium confidence). Ocean warming and changes in primary production since the 20th century are related to changes in productivity of many fish stocks (high confidence), with an average decrease of approximately 3% per decade in population replenishment and 4.1% (very likely range of 9.0% decline to 0.3% increase) in maximum catch potential (robust evidence, low agreement between fish stocks, medium confidence). For existing international and national ocean and fisheries governance, there are concerns about the reduced effectiveness to achieve mandated ecological, economic, and social objectives because of observed climate impacts on fisheries resources (high confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.2}
Coastal ecosystems are observed to be under stress from ocean warming and SLR that are exacerbated by non-climatic pressures from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). Distributions of seagrass meadows and kelp forests are contracting at low-latitudes that is attributable to warming (high confidence), and in some areas a loss of 36–43% following heat waves (medium confidence). Sessile calcified organisms (e.g., barnacles and mussels) in intertidal rocky shores are highly sensitive to extreme temperature events and acidification (high confidence), a reduction in their biodiversity and abundance have been observed in naturally-acidified rocky reef ecosystems (medium confidence). Increasing trends in ocean acidification in the California Current EBUS and deoxygenation in California Current and Humboldt Current EBUS are observed in the last few decades (high confidence), although there is low confidence to distinguish anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. {Box 5.3} 
Since the early 1980s, the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) and pathogenic organisms (e.g., Vibrio) has increased in coastal areas in response to warming, deoxygenation and eutrophication, with negative impacts on food provisioning, tourism, the economy and human health (high confidence). Under the high emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5) the impacts by 2090 are substantially larger and more widespread than for the low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) throughout the surface and deep ocean, including: warming (virtually certain); ocean acidification (virtually certain); decreased stability of mineral forms of calcite (virtually certain); oxygen loss (very likely); reduced near-surface nutrients (likely as not); decreased net primary productivity (high confidence); reduced fish production (likely) and loss of key ecosystems services (medium confidence) that are important for human well-being and sustainable development. The 0–2000 m layer is projected to warm by 900 ZJ (very likely range 650–1340 ZJ) by 2100 for the RCP2.6 scenario, and the overall warming of the ocean will continue this century even after radiative forcing and mean surface temperatures stabilise (high confidence). There is increasing evidence of an increase in the seasonal exposure to acidified conditions in the future (high confidence), with a very likely increase in the amplitude of seasonal cycle of hydrogen iron concentrations of 71–90% by 2100, relative to 2000 for the RCP8.5 scenario, especially at high latitudes. Globally, the sinking flux of organic matter from the upper ocean into the ocean interior is very likely to decrease by 9–16% for RCP8.5 in response to increased stratification and reduced nutrient supply, especially in tropical regions (medium confidence), which will reduce organic carbon supply to deep sea ecosystems (high confidence). {Box 5.1, Box 5.1 Figure 1} 
Simulated ocean warming and changes in NPP during the 21st century are projected to alter community structure of marine organisms (high confidence), reduce global marine animal biomass (medium confidence) and the maximum potential catches of fish stocks (medium confidence) with regional differences in the direction and magnitude of changes (high confidence). Projected climate change impacts on fisheries also increase the risk of potential conflicts among fishery area users and authorities or among two different communities within the same country (medium confidence), exacerbated through competing resource exploitation from international actors and mal-adapted policies (low confidence). {5.2.4}
Structure and functions of all types of coastal ecosystems will continue to be at moderate to high risk under the RCP2.6 scenario (medium confidence) and will face high to very high risk under the RCP8.5 scenario (high confidence) by 2100. Seagrass meadows (high confidence) and kelp forests (high confidence) will face moderate to high risk at temperature above 1.5oC global sea surface warming. Coral reefs will face very high risk at temperatures 1.5°C of global sea surface warming (very high confidence). Intertidal rocky shores will continue to be affected by ocean acidification, warming, and extreme heat exposure during low tide emersion, causing reduction of calcareous species and loss of ecosystem biodiversity and complexity shifting towards algae dominated habitats (high confidence). {5.3, 5.4.1}
Almost all coral reefs will degrade from their current state, even if global warming remains below 2ᴼC (very high confidence), and the remaining shallow coral reef communities will differ in species composition and diversity from present reefs (very high confidence). These declines in coral reef health will greatly diminish the services they provide to society, such as food provision (high confidence), coastal protection (high confidence) and tourism (medium confidence). The Pacific EBUS are projected to have calcium carbonate undersaturation in surface waters within a few decades under RCP8.5 (high confidence); combined with warming and decreasing oxygen levels, this will increase the impacts on shellfish larvae, benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes (high confidence) and related fisheries and aquaculture (medium confidence). The inherent natural variability of EBUS, together with uncertainties in present and future trends in the intensity and seasonality of upwelling, coastal warming and stratification, primary production and biogeochemistry of source waters poses large challenges in projecting the response of EBUS to climate change and to the adaptation of governance of biodiversity conservation and living marine resources in EBUS (high confidence). {5.4.2} 
Climate change increases the exposure and bioaccumulation of contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and mercury (medium confidence), and their risk of impacts on marine ecosystems and seafood safety (high agreement, medium evidence, medium confidence). Such risks are particularly large for top predators and for human communities that have high consumption on these organisms, including coastal Indigenous communities (medium confidence). These fishery governance related risks are widespread under high emissions scenarios with regional hotspots (medium confidence), and highlight the limits of existing natural resource management frameworks for addressing ecosystem change (high confidence). Ecosystem restoration may be able to locally reduce climate risks (medium confidence) but at relatively high cost and effectiveness limited to low emissions scenarios and to less sensitive systems (high confidence). Conservation of these habitats would also sustain the wide range of ecosystem services they provide and assist with climate adaptation through improving critical habitats for biodiversity, enhancing local fisheries production, and protecting coastal communities from SLR and storm events (high confidence). Other human interventions to enhance marine carbon uptake, for example, ocean alkalinisation (enhanced weathering), would also have governance challenges, with the increased risk of undesirable ecological consequences (high confidence). Hard engineering responses are more effective when supported by ecosystem-based adaptation approaches (high agreement), and both approaches are enhanced by combining with socioinstitutional approaches for adaptation (high confidence). {5.5.2.1}
Socioinstitutional adaptation responses, including community-based adaptation, capacity-building, participatory processes, institutional support for adaptation planning and support mechanisms for communities are important tools to address climate change impacts (high confidence). However, the effectiveness of these approaches to increase resilience to climate stressors and their large-scale implementation for reef restoration will be limited unless warming and ocean acidification are rapidly controlled (high confidence). {5.5.3}
There are a broad range of identified barriers and limits for adaptation to climate change in ecosystems and human systems (high confidence). Limitations include the space that ecosystems require, non-climatic drivers and human impacts that need to be addressed as part of the adaptation response, the lowering of adaptive capacity of ecosystems because of climate change, and the slower ecosystem recovery rates relative to the recurrence of climate impacts, availability of technology, knowledge and financial support and existing governance structures (medium confidence). Observed warming and high-latitude freshening are making the surface ocean less dense over time relative to the deeper ocean (high confidence 2) and inhibiting the exchange between surface and deep waters. Evidence is growing that the ocean carbon sink is dynamic on decadal timescales, especially in the Southern Ocean, which has affected the total global ocean carbon sink (medium confidence). {5.2.2.4}

Ongoing and Emerging Changes in the Ocean and Cryosphere, and their Impacts on Ecosystems and Human Societies
Anthropogenic climate change has increased observed precipitation (medium confidence), winds (low confidence), and extreme sea level events (high confidence) associated with some tropical cyclones, which has increased intensity of multiple extreme events and associated cascading impacts (high confidence). Changes in Arctic sea ice have the potential to influence mid-latitude weather (medium confidence), but there is low confidence in the detection of this influence for specific weather types. {6.3}



Marine heatwaves (MHWs), periods of extremely high ocean temperatures, have negatively impacted marine organisms and ecosystems in all ocean basins over the last two decades, including critical foundation species such as corals, seagrasses and kelps (very high confidence).

There is medium confidence that including extremes and abrupt changes, such as AMOC weakening, ice sheet collapse (West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS)), leads to a several-fold increase in the cost of carbon emissions (medium confidence). {6.3, 6.9}

It is not comprehensive in terms of the systems assessed and some information on extremes, abrupt and irreversible changes, in particular for the cryosphere, may be found in other chapters

Ongoing and Emerging Changes in the Ocean and Cryosphere, and their Impacts on Ecosystems and Human Societies
Anthropogenic climate change has increased observed precipitation (medium confidence), winds (low confidence), and extreme sea level events (high confidence) associated with some tropical cyclones, which has increased intensity of multiple extreme events and associated cascading impacts (high confidence). Changes in Arctic sea ice have the potential to influence mid-latitude weather (medium confidence), but there is low confidence in the detection of this influence for specific weather types. {6.3}



Marine heatwaves (MHWs), periods of extremely high ocean temperatures, have negatively impacted marine organisms and ecosystems in all ocean basins over the last two decades, including critical foundation species such as corals, seagrasses and kelps (very high confidence). In the last two decades, total water transport from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean by the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), and the Indian Ocean to Atlantic Ocean has increased (high confidence). {6.8, Box 6.1}

We will do this because we are forced to and we still hope we will come to the fruitful mutual advantageous trading relationship.”At a meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, differences also emerged over how to treat US tech companies, as the EU runs into limits on US goods it can target.In the planned counter-tariffs, the bloc aims to target US products that can be easily replaced, such as soya beans and consumer goods, rather than, for example, liquified natural gas, imported energy that is helping the EU replace Russian gas.France, which has called for a suspension of investment into the US, has said nothing should be off the table when it comes to retaliation. The French delegate for trade, Laurent Saint-Martin, said on Monday that no option on goods or services could be excluded and that the EU could be “extremely, extremely aggressive also in return”, referring to the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument.He said: “Our end goal remains the same, to negotiate this escalation and negotiate back to where things were, and if it’s not possible, of course, [the] European Union must react, must react firmly and must react proportionately.”But Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, rejected calls to target US tech companies, describing such a measure as “an extraordinary escalation at a time when we must be working for a de-escalation”.The first face-to-face contact between the EU and the US administration over the tariffs will happen on Tuesday when Ireland’s agriculture minister meets his counterpart in Washington.The Irish deputy prime minister will then meet the US commerce secretary in the US capital on Wednesday to press home Irish and EU interests in de-escalating the dispute, which affects the Irish dairy and pharma sectors.The EU’s never-used anti-coercion law would allow the bloc to take wide-ranging measures against a country deemed to be using trade as a weapon, such as suspending intellectual property rights, revoking licences to do business in the EU and banning companies from bidding for public contracts.Šefčovič, who was briefing ministers on his recent calls with senior US officials, said “a paradigm shift” in global trade was under way.EU trade and economy ministers began meeting in Luxembourg as Trump’s tariffs continued to roil global stock markets, deepening last week’s two-day sell-off that analysts called one of the worst since the second world war. Trump’s tariffs are affecting €382bn of EU exports to the US.Habeck, the outgoing German economy minister, also gave a blunt verdict on Trump tariffs, saying the US president’s widely derided models were “ridiculous” and describing recent comments by Elon Musk as “a sign of weakness”.The billionaire adviser to the US president and owner of Tesla said over the weekend that he hoped to see complete freedom of trade between the US and Europe. “This doesn’t mean declaring war against America, this means defending our businesses,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEuropeTariffsGiorgia MeloniViktor OrbánnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyKeir and Rachel stay upbeat amid chaos caused by He Who Cannot Be NamedEU has a ‘strong plan’ to retaliate on Trump tariffs, says von der LeyenPoliticians criticise US efforts to make EU firms reverse diversity initiativesCaribbean is friend of US, not an enemy, tariff-hit regional leaders tell TrumpStockpile 72 hours of supplies in case of disaster or attack, EU tells citizensStarmer announces support for car and pharma industries in ‘age of insecurity’Trump tariffs risk higher prices and make US recession more likely, says JP Morgan bossEU ready to impose more sanctions on Russia after summit talks‘Several people’ arrested in EU bribery investigation linked to HuaweiMarkets brace for another volatile week as Trump’s most punitive tariffs kick inMost viewedMost viewed

The French delegate for trade, Laurent Saint-Martin, said on Monday that no option on goods or services could be excluded and that the EU could be “extremely, extremely aggressive also in return”, referring to the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument.He said: “Our end goal remains the same, to negotiate this escalation and negotiate back to where things were, and if it’s not possible, of course, [the] European Union must react, must react firmly and must react proportionately.”But Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, rejected calls to target US tech companies, describing such a measure as “an extraordinary escalation at a time when we must be working for a de-escalation”.The first face-to-face contact between the EU and the US administration over the tariffs will happen on Tuesday when Ireland’s agriculture minister meets his counterpart in Washington.The Irish deputy prime minister will then meet the US commerce secretary in the US capital on Wednesday to press home Irish and EU interests in de-escalating the dispute, which affects the Irish dairy and pharma sectors.The EU’s never-used anti-coercion law would allow the bloc to take wide-ranging measures against a country deemed to be using trade as a weapon, such as suspending intellectual property rights, revoking licences to do business in the EU and banning companies from bidding for public contracts.Šefčovič, who was briefing ministers on his recent calls with senior US officials, said “a paradigm shift” in global trade was under way.EU trade and economy ministers began meeting in Luxembourg as Trump’s tariffs continued to roil global stock markets, deepening last week’s two-day sell-off that analysts called one of the worst since the second world war. Trump’s tariffs are affecting €382bn of EU exports to the US.Habeck, the outgoing German economy minister, also gave a blunt verdict on Trump tariffs, saying the US president’s widely derided models were “ridiculous” and describing recent comments by Elon Musk as “a sign of weakness”.The billionaire adviser to the US president and owner of Tesla said over the weekend that he hoped to see complete freedom of trade between the US and Europe.

What we do
Due to the powers vested in its Charter and its unique international character, the United Nations can take action on the issues confronting humanity in the 21st century, including:Maintain international peace and securityProtect human rightsDeliver humanitarian aidPromote sustainable developmentUphold international law






  
  
 Maintain International Peace and Security 
 The United Nations came into being in 1945, following the devastation of the Second World War, with one central mission: the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. Protect Human Rights 
 The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. Deliver Humanitarian Aid 
 One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is ""to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.""  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. Promote Sustainable Development 
 From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. Uphold International Law 
 The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.""  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations. Structure of the United Nations
The main parts of the UN structure are the General Assembly, theSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the UN Secretariat. All 193 Member States of the UN are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal representation. Security Council 
 The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. Economic and Social Council 
 The Economic and Social Council is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as implementation of internationally agreed development goals. Trusteeship Council 
 The Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 by the UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States, and ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence. International Court of Justice 
 The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Secretariat 
 The Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and tens of thousands of international UN staff members who carry out the day-to-day work of the UN as mandated by the General Assembly and the Organization's other principal organs. Our Common Agenda 
 Following up on a pledge made by UN Member States at the UN’s 75th anniversary, the report Our Common Agenda looks ahead to the next 25 years and represents the Secretary-General’s vision on the future of global cooperation. Find out more in

What we do
Due to the powers vested in its Charter and its unique international character, the United Nations can take action on the issues confronting humanity in the 21st century, including:Maintain international peace and securityProtect human rightsDeliver humanitarian aidPromote sustainable developmentUphold international law






  
  
 Maintain International Peace and Security 
 The United Nations came into being in 1945, following the devastation of the Second World War, with one central mission: the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. Protect Human Rights 
 The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. Deliver Humanitarian Aid 
 One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is ""to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.""  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. Promote Sustainable Development 
 From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. Uphold International Law 
 The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.""  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations. What we do

  Earth System domains




Cryosphere includes the components of the Earth System at and below the land and ocean surface that are frozen, including snow cover, glaciers, ice sheets, ice shelves, icebergs, sea ice, lake ice, river ice, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground, and solid precipitation. IPCC Special Report







10%
Around 10% of Earth’s land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. IPCC Special Report







58 m
The amount of ice of the Antarctica ice sheet, if completely melted, will cause a sea level rise of 58 m. The cryosphere, its changes, and its impacts have received increased attention in recent years, creating a demand for authoritative information on the state of the world’s snow and ice resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) states that “over the last decades, global warming has led to widespread shrinking of the cryosphere, with mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers, reduction in snow cover, and Arctic Sea ice extent and thickness, and increased permafrost temperatures”. Although the volume equivalent of glaciers in terms of global sea level rise is small (0.4 m) compared to that of the ice sheets of Greenland (7.2 m) and Antarctica (about 58 m), their relative contribution to recent global sea level rise has been much larger. Melting of glaciers and ice caps in the second half of the 20th century led to about a 2.5 cm rise in sea level, in contrast to the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which added about 1 cm to sea level. The WMO's Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) fosters international coordination and partnerships between scientific and operational communities with the goal of meeting the cryosphere data and information need of Members and partners, in support of Earth system monitoring, modelling and prediction. 相关出版物

IPCC Special Report

概述

The term “cryosphere” originates to the Greek word ‘kryos’ for frost or ice cold. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) states that “over the last decades, global warming has led to widespread shrinking of the cryosphere, with mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers, reduction in snow cover, and Arctic Sea ice extent and thickness, and increased permafrost temperatures”. Although the volume equivalent of glaciers in terms of global sea level rise is small (0.4 m) compared to that of the ice sheets of Greenland (7.2 m) and Antarctica (about 58 m), their relative contribution to recent global sea level rise has been much larger. Melting of glaciers and ice caps in the second half of the 20th century led to about a 2.5 cm rise in sea level, in contrast to the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which added about 1 cm to sea level. The WMO's Global Cryosphere Watch (GCW) fosters international coordination and partnerships between scientific and operational communities with the goal of meeting the cryosphere data and information need of Members and partners, in support of Earth system monitoring, modelling and prediction.

How do you price the risk of ‘economic nuclear winter’?

EO 70 to end insurgency’s ‘treacherous life cycle’: new AFP Chief | Philippine News Agency,https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1090045,other,0.30000000000000004,,"(Rey Baniquet/Presidential Photo)

MANILA – Lauding the significant gains of the National Task Force to End Local Communist (lNTF ELCAC), the newly-installed Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is confident that the multi-pronged approach of Executive Order 70 will put an end to the treacherous life cycle of the more than five decades of insurgency.Speaking during the AFP Change of Command ceremony on Jan. General Felimon  Santos, said unlike in the past when local chief executives left the insurgency problem solely to the AFP and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to deal with, EO involves all government agencies from the national to the barangay level with delineated roles and responsibilities in the whole-of-nation approach.“Government agencies and their corresponding units at all levels cooperate, interact, support, provide practical solutions and solve problems and issues on the ground that are being exploited by these communist terrorists in order to stir-up our countrymen to fight against our government through armed struggle,” Santos said.He added that EO 70, which was signed by President R. Duterte in December 2018, created NTF ELCAC that institutionalized a whole-of-nation approach in obtaining exclusive and sustainable peace-giving us an effective solution against communist-terrorists.“This multi-pronged approach addresses the motivation for insurgency and will hopefully put an end to its treacherous life cycle,” he said, adding that by doing so, there will be no reason for the Communist Party of the Philippines, its armed wing the New People's Army, and the National Democratic Front to agitate, organize and mobilize the vulnerable sectors and communities.Good governanceSantos, who headed the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command based in Davao City, said he witnessed what EO provides for as it is being actually done in the provinces of Davao Oriental by Governor Nelson Dayanghirang, Davao de Oro by Governor Tyron Uy, Davao del Norte by Governor Edwin Jubahib, and Davao City by Mayor Sara Duterte.“Good governance practices and the efficient delivery of basic services for their constituents create resilient communities that thwart the return of the communist terrorist groups in their respective provinces and city,” he added.The AFP, he said, can now focus its resources, manpower, and firepower on the remaining communists who persist with armed struggle despite the government’s goodwill through cash assistance, livelihood training, and housing.Santos, who is the 53rd AFP Chief of Staff taking the top military post from retired General Noel Clement, vowed to immediately neutralize groups that insist on seizing political power through armed struggle and other local terrorist groups like Abu Sayyaf.“We shall effectively counter their narratives through good governance, build community trust and earn the people’s respect, he said.He added that vigilance, support, and cooperation in the local populace are needed in order to suppress and prevent any future terroristic plans from occurring and avoiding the unnecessary loss of human lives and damage to property.“The AFP should always be battle-ready to counteract any threat that confronts our desire for peace,” he said, adding that the AFP remains committed to supporting and working towards a successful implementation of the agreements for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and the peace accord with the Moro National Liberation Front.

Duterte in December 2018, created NTF ELCAC that institutionalized a whole-of-nation approach in obtaining exclusive and sustainable peace-giving us an effective solution against communist-terrorists.“This multi-pronged approach addresses the motivation for insurgency and will hopefully put an end to its treacherous life cycle,” he said, adding that by doing so, there will be no reason for the Communist Party of the Philippines, its armed wing the New People's Army, and the National Democratic Front to agitate, organize and mobilize the vulnerable sectors and communities.Good governanceSantos, who headed the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command based in Davao City, said he witnessed what EO provides for as it is being actually done in the provinces of Davao Oriental by Governor Nelson Dayanghirang, Davao de Oro by Governor Tyron Uy, Davao del Norte by Governor Edwin Jubahib, and Davao City by Mayor Sara Duterte.“Good governance practices and the efficient delivery of basic services for their constituents create resilient communities that thwart the return of the communist terrorist groups in their respective provinces and city,” he added.The AFP, he said, can now focus its resources, manpower, and firepower on the remaining communists who persist with armed struggle despite the government’s goodwill through cash assistance, livelihood training, and housing.Santos, who is the 53rd AFP Chief of Staff taking the top military post from retired General Noel Clement, vowed to immediately neutralize groups that insist on seizing political power through armed struggle and other local terrorist groups like Abu Sayyaf.“We shall effectively counter their narratives through good governance, build community trust and earn the people’s respect, he said.He added that vigilance, support, and cooperation in the local populace are needed in order to suppress and prevent any future terroristic plans from occurring and avoiding the unnecessary loss of human lives and damage to property.“The AFP should always be battle-ready to counteract any threat that confronts our desire for peace,” he said, adding that the AFP remains committed to supporting and working towards a successful implementation of the agreements for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and the peace accord with the Moro National Liberation Front.

UN peacekeeping challenged as conflicts and ceasefires grow more complex | UN News,https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1161976,UN_organization,0.4,,"Addressing ambassadors in the Security Council, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, head of UN peace operations, highlighted the need for change.“Ceasefire monitoring can no longer be just about being present, it is about rapidly understanding and acting on what is happening on the ground,” he said.Advances in technology, he explained, are helping ‘blue helmets’ increase their impact by allowing them to monitor vast and complex landscapes in near-real time – overcoming the need to be physically on the ground.At the same time, a political process backed by the unified support of Member States, particularly the Security Council, remains vital to secure and sustain peace.

Ceasefires depend on combatants“While peacekeeping can be an integral part of a ceasefire monitoring regime, the success of any ceasefire remains the sole responsibility of the parties [to the agreement],” he said.Lieutenant General Aroldo Lázaro Sáenz, Head of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), also underscored the critical importance of political process.Originally established in 1978, the mandate of UNIFIL was most recently defined in resolution 1701 of 2006, which called for a full cessation of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel following the 34-day war in Lebanon.It reinforced UNIFIL’s mandate to monitor the ceasefire, support the Lebanese Armed Forces deployment in southern Lebanon and facilitate humanitarian access.However, the conflict between Israeli security forces and Hezbollah following the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in southern Israel, complicated UNIFIL’s operating environment, until the cessation of hostilities agreed in November 2024.“Since this cessation of hostilities and in the absence of a permanent ceasefire, one of the main obstacles has always been that the parties interpret differently their obligations under resolution 1701 and now with respect to the cessation of hostilities understanding,” Lt. Lázaro said, noting that UNIFIL has implemented a structured communication strategy to counter misinformation, ensuring that messages are fact-based, clear and consistent across all peacekeeping units.“It is essential that government actors also make public statements to sensitize the population to UNIFIL’s role and mandate, to avoid misperception,” he added.Like UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) is also combating the growing influence of disinformation, which armed groups exploit to destabilize communities and undermine peacekeeping efforts. Gomes said.“In recent months, we have observed the use of readily available drones for reconnaissance by armed groups and the exploitation of encrypted messaging apps for coordination and propaganda dissemination, circumventing traditional monitoring methods.”He warned that these tactics, combined with the willingness of armed groups to operate beyond traditional State control, make them unpredictable and difficult to counter.To address these evolving threats, MONUSCO has adapted its strategies to swiftly integrate new capabilities - both from the private industry and contributing nations – within weeks or months, rather than years.

Ceasefires depend on combatants“While peacekeeping can be an integral part of a ceasefire monitoring regime, the success of any ceasefire remains the sole responsibility of the parties [to the agreement],” he said.Lieutenant General Aroldo Lázaro Sáenz, Head of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), also underscored the critical importance of political process.Originally established in 1978, the mandate of UNIFIL was most recently defined in resolution 1701 of 2006, which called for a full cessation of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel following the 34-day war in Lebanon.It reinforced UNIFIL’s mandate to monitor the ceasefire, support the Lebanese Armed Forces deployment in southern Lebanon and facilitate humanitarian access.However, the conflict between Israeli security forces and Hezbollah following the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in southern Israel, complicated UNIFIL’s operating environment, until the cessation of hostilities agreed in November 2024.“Since this cessation of hostilities and in the absence of a permanent ceasefire, one of the main obstacles has always been that the parties interpret differently their obligations under resolution 1701 and now with respect to the cessation of hostilities understanding,” Lt. Lázaro said, noting that UNIFIL has implemented a structured communication strategy to counter misinformation, ensuring that messages are fact-based, clear and consistent across all peacekeeping units.“It is essential that government actors also make public statements to sensitize the population to UNIFIL’s role and mandate, to avoid misperception,” he added.Like UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) is also combating the growing influence of disinformation, which armed groups exploit to destabilize communities and undermine peacekeeping efforts. security councilpeacekeeping

UN peacekeeping challenged as conflicts and ceasefires grow more complex

UN peacekeeping challenged as conflicts and ceasefires grow more complex

7 April 2025
 Peace and Security As ceasefires grow more fragile and conflicts more unpredictable, UN peacekeeping is having to adapt faster amid rising political tensions, disinformation and confusion over mandates. Addressing ambassadors in the Security Council, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, head of UN peace operations, highlighted the need for change.“Ceasefire monitoring can no longer be just about being present, it is about rapidly understanding and acting on what is happening on the ground,” he said.Advances in technology, he explained, are helping ‘blue helmets’ increase their impact by allowing them to monitor vast and complex landscapes in near-real time – overcoming the need to be physically on the ground.At the same time, a political process backed by the unified support of Member States, particularly the Security Council, remains vital to secure and sustain peace.

Addressing ambassadors in the Security Council, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, head of UN peace operations, highlighted the need for change.“Ceasefire monitoring can no longer be just about being present, it is about rapidly understanding and acting on what is happening on the ground,” he said.Advances in technology, he explained, are helping ‘blue helmets’ increase their impact by allowing them to monitor vast and complex landscapes in near-real time – overcoming the need to be physically on the ground.At the same time, a political process backed by the unified support of Member States, particularly the Security Council, remains vital to secure and sustain peace.

I am announcing that the government of Canada, following a dollar for dollar approach, will be imposing, as of 12.01am, tomorrow, March 13, 2025, 25% reciprocal tariffs on an additional $29.8bn of imports from the United States. It’s easy to forget that all countries are affected by US tariffs.Brazil’s finance minister Fernando Haddad said that the South American country will not immediately retaliate against tariffs imposed by the United States on steel and aluminium imports, instead seeking negotiations.The relief rally on Wall Street, sparked by a dip in US inflation, is petering out.The Dow Jones is now down 0.7%, the S&P 500 is flat and the Nasdaq, which rose 1.8% earlier, is only 0.7% ahead.Here in Europe, the German and Italian equity markets are still more than 1% ahead while the French bourse has pared gains to trade 0.3% higher.

However, heightened trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the United States will likely slow the pace of economic activity and increase inflationary pressures in Canada.

BritishAmerican Business, a transatlantic trade and business group, representing more than 470 companies on both sides of the Atlantic, has responded to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium.Its chief executive Duncan Edwards said:
The new US administration has set out to be a pro-business, pro-growth government and there is much in its agenda that our members will be encouraged by. We welcome the UK government’s decision not to introduce its own retaliatory tariffs, and we hope discussions between the two governments can help reduce trade and investment barriers, strengthen economic ties, and ensure businesses on both sides of the Atlantic can thrive. While US inflation has cooled, US tariffs threaten to push price growth higher again in coming months, warned James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.He said:
Good news on inflation, but the fact it was overwhelmingly caused by falling airfares has muted the market reaction. The Dow Jones has edged 0.1% higher while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is 1.7% ahead and the S&P 500 index gained 0.7%.Over here, European stock markets have notched up chunky gains despite the looming trade war between the United States and the European Union.

BritishAmerican Business, a transatlantic trade and business group, representing more than 470 companies on both sides of the Atlantic, has responded to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium.Its chief executive Duncan Edwards said:
The new US administration has set out to be a pro-business, pro-growth government and there is much in its agenda that our members will be encouraged by. We welcome the UK government’s decision not to introduce its own retaliatory tariffs, and we hope discussions between the two governments can help reduce trade and investment barriers, strengthen economic ties, and ensure businesses on both sides of the Atlantic can thrive. While US inflation has cooled, US tariffs threaten to push price growth higher again in coming months, warned James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.He said:
Good news on inflation, but the fact it was overwhelmingly caused by falling airfares has muted the market reaction. The Dow Jones has edged 0.1% higher while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is 1.7% ahead and the S&P 500 index gained 0.7%.Over here, European stock markets have notched up chunky gains despite the looming trade war between the United States and the European Union.

While US inflation has cooled, US tariffs threaten to push price growth higher again in coming months, warned James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.He said:
Good news on inflation, but the fact it was overwhelmingly caused by falling airfares has muted the market reaction. While US inflation has cooled, US tariffs threaten to push price growth higher again in coming months, warned James Knightley, chief international economist at ING."
RightUp is here! - Amnesty Philippines,https://www.amnesty.org.ph/rightup/,NGO,0.30000000000000004,,"RightUp is Amnesty International’s first youth-led research project. RightUp aims to recognise and resource youth expertise to proactively lead, contribute to, and shape Amnesty research. By providing training and skills-building programs, the project will support young Filipinos to conduct their own research on young people’s digital rights in the Philippines. What RightUp Will Be All About





Amnesty International is looking for 8-10 talented young researchers to create the first youth-led research in the Philippines. As part of the RightUp Youth Research Team, you will embark on a research journey focusing on the role that technology plays in the lives of young Filipinos and the impact it has on your rights and well-being. While the general topic will revolve around online harassment of young activists, the approach, specific focus, and shape of the research will be decided entirely by you (and the rest of your team)! You will be supported by a team of experts from Amnesty who will provide you with training and guidance as you go through the entire participatory action research process towards *fingers-crossed* publication–which may be a formal report but could also even be a zine, a documentary, or other creative youth-friendly output. The training program is designed to provide you with additional insight into human rights, digital rights, and the participatory action research methodology. It will also equip you with the technical skills needed to execute youth-led research and the soft skills that will help you work successfully together as a unit. By conducting desk research, surveys and the like, you will work together as a team to deep dive into the issues you explored during the kick off workshop in a quest to find your research topic. During this workshop, you will be working together to design your strategy and research methodology, and create a research plan. You will also undergo workshops on the participatory action research methodology, tools for data collection, and stakeholder mapping and engagement among many others. Applications Procedure

Trump announces 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum | Trump administration | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/trump-steel-aluminum-tariffs,news_outlet,0.325,,"The action announced on Monday night ends exemptions granted to certain countries, and increases the duty rate on aluminum.The changes are not due to come into effect until early March, however, according to a White House official – raising the prospect of the Trump administration brokering deals with governments seeking reprieve.Countries including Australia have already been making their case and Trump later said he would give “great consideration” to Australia’s request for an exemption to the steel tariffs due to that country’s trade deficit with the US.Trump first trailed his latest tariff actions on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and MexicoRead more“The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America’s economic and national security,” Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, told reporters.“This isn’t just about trade. It’s about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum.”Trump will also impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be “melted and poured” and aluminum to be “smelted and cast” within the region to curb US imports of minimally processed Chinese and Russian metals that circumvent other tariffs.Trump and his allies, who repeatedly claimed that tariffs could “Make America great again” when fighting to regain the White House, believe that higher taxes on imported steel and aluminum will help shore up US industrial heartlands.The US president said he would announce plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on other countries over the next two days. He signed two proclamations as he spoke to reporters in the Oval Office: one ending waivers granted by Joe Biden to steel and aluminum tariffs instituted during his first term, and the other raising duties on both metals to 25%.He also raised the prospect of future US tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals from markets across the world.Asked about the possibility of other countries retaliating against US tariffs, Trump said: “I don’t mind.”Canada’s industry minister said the US tariffs were “totally unjustified”, with Canadian steel and aluminum supporting key US industries including defense, shipbuilding, energy and autos.“This is making North America more competitive and secure,” François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.

Modified US duties will be enforced ‘without exceptions’, said president, in controversial bid to boost economy

What are the tariffs on steel and aluminum Trump announced? Why Trump tariffs will be ‘very bad for America and for the world’

Modified US duties will be enforced ‘without exceptions’, said president, in controversial bid to boost economy

Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum on Monday, ramping up his controversial attempt to boost the US economy by hiking taxes on imports from overseas.The modified US duties will be enforced “without exceptions or exemptions”, the president declared, dashing the hopes of countries that hoped to avoid them.Trump first imposed steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum during his first presidency. The action announced on Monday night ends exemptions granted to certain countries, and increases the duty rate on aluminum.The changes are not due to come into effect until early March, however, according to a White House official – raising the prospect of the Trump administration brokering deals with governments seeking reprieve.Countries including Australia have already been making their case and Trump later said he would give “great consideration” to Australia’s request for an exemption to the steel tariffs due to that country’s trade deficit with the US.Trump first trailed his latest tariff actions on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and MexicoRead more“The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America’s economic and national security,” Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, told reporters.“This isn’t just about trade.

Multiple business leaders, including Bill Ackman, Ken Fisher, Larry Fink and Jamie Dimon, spoke out against Trump’s tariffs today, forming a growing chorus of influential billionaires who are turning against Trump’s policy. Some companies, including Amazon and Meta, saw small gains, while Apple and Tesla both saw drops of at least 6%.Asked if he would be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations, Trump says: “We’re not looking at that.”He says there are many countries coming to negotiate deals with the US. In some cases they’ll be paying substantial tariffs, he adds.When asked whether countries could negotiate down the 10% baseline tariff, Trump insisted that the tariffs have been effective in getting countries to go to the negotiating table.“If I didn’t do what I did over the last couple of weeks, you wouldn’t have anyone who wants to negotiate,” Trump said. Trump has not been briefed on the plan, according to sources who spoke to Bloomberg, though it has been proposed to his economic team.It’s an acknowledgement of the harm that retaliatory tariffs will have on American exporters, who are facing a 34% tariff on exports to China and could face more from governments like the EU.Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro just published an op-ed in the Financial Times trying to argue that the new tariffs will fix a broken system.“This long-overdue restructuring will make both the US and global economies more resilient and prosperous by restoring fairness and balance to a system rigged against America,” Navarro wrote. The Dow is down about 900 points, about 2.2% down from the start of the day, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are 1.6% and 1.3% down, respectively.While the drops are smaller than what was seen on Thursday and Friday, all three index funds have dropped around 10% since the new tariffs were announced, erasing nearly a year’s worth of gains.Certain stocks have also continued to drop today: Apple and Tesla are both down about 5%. Over the last week, Apple saw its stock drop down nearly 20%, as its supply chain relies heavily on Chinese imports.In London, stocks were heavily depressed during Monday’s session, although they briefly swung higher during a rollercoaster afternoon amid conflicting reports over a potential pause in tariff policy.The FTSE 100 declined by 352.9 points, or 4.38%%, to close at 7,702.08.Monday’s session began with firm drops in the Asian markets after more reciprocal tariff announcements over the weekend weighed on trading sentiment.Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG, said: “The global stock market sell-off intensified on Monday after China retaliated against the US with reciprocal tariffs.“Some Asian stock indices fell by 10% on the day with the S&P 500 entering bear market territory with several European indices close on its heels.”The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.Elsewhere, Germany’s DAX is down 4.3%, France’s CAC is down 4.8%, Italy’s FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain’s IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump’s tariffs.Major UK banks have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have wreaked havoc on lenders’ share prices.The Guardian understands that lobby group UK Finance is holding a working level call with public policy staff from some of the country’s largest lenders, as they try to understand the ripple effects of US import taxes.While Trump’s tariffs are focused on physical goods rather than services, it will impact business borrowers and large corporate clients who sell products to the US.The harm caused by tariffs could dampen appetite for loans and investment banking services – which provide support for mergers, takeovers and fundraising.Tariffs could also make it harder for companies to repay their debts. That could, in turn, force banks to start putting aside money for potential defaults in their first quarter results, which are due later this month.After holding relatively stable during last week’s global market turmoil, cryptocurrencies have joined the sell-off.Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $75,000 Monday morning before seeing a slight rebound, AP reported.Bitcoin’s prices haven’t been this low since just after president Donald Trump’s Election Day victory last year launched a bull run in crypto prices. Trump, whose tariff announcements led to massive stock sell offs, has been a major promoter of the crypto industry and previously took credit when bitcoin’s price broke $100,000 in December.Bitcoin has been on a relatively steady slide in price since Trump took office earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsBusinessBusiness liveTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsStock marketsInternational tradeChinaShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewed

Stock markets around the globe continued to fall today, with the FTSE 100 and other European markets seeing further falls in the day. Multiple business leaders, including Bill Ackman, Ken Fisher, Larry Fink and Jamie Dimon, spoke out against Trump’s tariffs today, forming a growing chorus of influential billionaires who are turning against Trump’s policy. Some companies, including Amazon and Meta, saw small gains, while Apple and Tesla both saw drops of at least 6%.Asked if he would be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations, Trump says: “We’re not looking at that.”He says there are many countries coming to negotiate deals with the US. In some cases they’ll be paying substantial tariffs, he adds.When asked whether countries could negotiate down the 10% baseline tariff, Trump insisted that the tariffs have been effective in getting countries to go to the negotiating table.“If I didn’t do what I did over the last couple of weeks, you wouldn’t have anyone who wants to negotiate,” Trump said. Trump has not been briefed on the plan, according to sources who spoke to Bloomberg, though it has been proposed to his economic team.It’s an acknowledgement of the harm that retaliatory tariffs will have on American exporters, who are facing a 34% tariff on exports to China and could face more from governments like the EU.Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro just published an op-ed in the Financial Times trying to argue that the new tariffs will fix a broken system.“This long-overdue restructuring will make both the US and global economies more resilient and prosperous by restoring fairness and balance to a system rigged against America,” Navarro wrote. The Dow is down about 900 points, about 2.2% down from the start of the day, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are 1.6% and 1.3% down, respectively.While the drops are smaller than what was seen on Thursday and Friday, all three index funds have dropped around 10% since the new tariffs were announced, erasing nearly a year’s worth of gains.Certain stocks have also continued to drop today: Apple and Tesla are both down about 5%. Over the last week, Apple saw its stock drop down nearly 20%, as its supply chain relies heavily on Chinese imports.In London, stocks were heavily depressed during Monday’s session, although they briefly swung higher during a rollercoaster afternoon amid conflicting reports over a potential pause in tariff policy.The FTSE 100 declined by 352.9 points, or 4.38%%, to close at 7,702.08.Monday’s session began with firm drops in the Asian markets after more reciprocal tariff announcements over the weekend weighed on trading sentiment.Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG, said: “The global stock market sell-off intensified on Monday after China retaliated against the US with reciprocal tariffs.“Some Asian stock indices fell by 10% on the day with the S&P 500 entering bear market territory with several European indices close on its heels.”The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.Elsewhere, Germany’s DAX is down 4.3%, France’s CAC is down 4.8%, Italy’s FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain’s IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump’s tariffs.Major UK banks have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have wreaked havoc on lenders’ share prices.The Guardian understands that lobby group UK Finance is holding a working level call with public policy staff from some of the country’s largest lenders, as they try to understand the ripple effects of US import taxes.While Trump’s tariffs are focused on physical goods rather than services, it will impact business borrowers and large corporate clients who sell products to the US.The harm caused by tariffs could dampen appetite for loans and investment banking services – which provide support for mergers, takeovers and fundraising.Tariffs could also make it harder for companies to repay their debts. That could, in turn, force banks to start putting aside money for potential defaults in their first quarter results, which are due later this month.After holding relatively stable during last week’s global market turmoil, cryptocurrencies have joined the sell-off.Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $75,000 Monday morning before seeing a slight rebound, AP reported.Bitcoin’s prices haven’t been this low since just after president Donald Trump’s Election Day victory last year launched a bull run in crypto prices. Trump, whose tariff announcements led to massive stock sell offs, has been a major promoter of the crypto industry and previously took credit when bitcoin’s price broke $100,000 in December.Bitcoin has been on a relatively steady slide in price since Trump took office earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsBusinessBusiness liveTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsStock marketsInternational tradeChinaShareReuse this content

Stock markets around the globe continued to fall today, with the FTSE 100 and other European markets seeing further falls in the day. Some companies, including Amazon and Meta, saw small gains, while Apple and Tesla both saw drops of at least 6%.Asked if he would be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations, Trump says: “We’re not looking at that.”He says there are many countries coming to negotiate deals with the US.

The Dow is down about 900 points, about 2.2% down from the start of the day, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are 1.6% and 1.3% down, respectively.While the drops are smaller than what was seen on Thursday and Friday, all three index funds have dropped around 10% since the new tariffs were announced, erasing nearly a year’s worth of gains.Certain stocks have also continued to drop today: Apple and Tesla are both down about 5%. Over the last week, Apple saw its stock drop down nearly 20%, as its supply chain relies heavily on Chinese imports.In London, stocks were heavily depressed during Monday’s session, although they briefly swung higher during a rollercoaster afternoon amid conflicting reports over a potential pause in tariff policy.The FTSE 100 declined by 352.9 points, or 4.38%%, to close at 7,702.08.Monday’s session began with firm drops in the Asian markets after more reciprocal tariff announcements over the weekend weighed on trading sentiment.Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG, said: “The global stock market sell-off intensified on Monday after China retaliated against the US with reciprocal tariffs.“Some Asian stock indices fell by 10% on the day with the S&P 500 entering bear market territory with several European indices close on its heels.”The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.Elsewhere, Germany’s DAX is down 4.3%, France’s CAC is down 4.8%, Italy’s FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain’s IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump’s tariffs.Major UK banks have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have wreaked havoc on lenders’ share prices.The Guardian understands that lobby group UK Finance is holding a working level call with public policy staff from some of the country’s largest lenders, as they try to understand the ripple effects of US import taxes.While Trump’s tariffs are focused on physical goods rather than services, it will impact business borrowers and large corporate clients who sell products to the US.The harm caused by tariffs could dampen appetite for loans and investment banking services – which provide support for mergers, takeovers and fundraising.Tariffs could also make it harder for companies to repay their debts.

Here’s an overview of what happened today:

Stock markets around the globe continued to fall today, with the FTSE 100 and other European markets seeing further falls in the day. Asked if he would be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations, Trump says: “We’re not looking at that.”He says there are many countries coming to negotiate deals with the US. In some cases they’ll be paying substantial tariffs, he adds.When asked whether countries could negotiate down the 10% baseline tariff, Trump insisted that the tariffs have been effective in getting countries to go to the negotiating table.“If I didn’t do what I did over the last couple of weeks, you wouldn’t have anyone who wants to negotiate,” Trump said. “Now they’re coming to us.”

Asked if he would be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiations, Trump says: “We’re not looking at that.”

He says there are many countries coming to negotiate deals with the US. The Dow is down about 900 points, about 2.2% down from the start of the day, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are 1.6% and 1.3% down, respectively.While the drops are smaller than what was seen on Thursday and Friday, all three index funds have dropped around 10% since the new tariffs were announced, erasing nearly a year’s worth of gains.Certain stocks have also continued to drop today: Apple and Tesla are both down about 5%. In London, stocks were heavily depressed during Monday’s session, although they briefly swung higher during a rollercoaster afternoon amid conflicting reports over a potential pause in tariff policy.The FTSE 100 declined by 352.9 points, or 4.38%%, to close at 7,702.08.Monday’s session began with firm drops in the Asian markets after more reciprocal tariff announcements over the weekend weighed on trading sentiment.Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG, said: “The global stock market sell-off intensified on Monday after China retaliated against the US with reciprocal tariffs.“Some Asian stock indices fell by 10% on the day with the S&P 500 entering bear market territory with several European indices close on its heels.”

In London, stocks were heavily depressed during Monday’s session, although they briefly swung higher during a rollercoaster afternoon amid conflicting reports over a potential pause in tariff policy. “Some Asian stock indices fell by 10% on the day with the S&P 500 entering bear market territory with several European indices close on its heels.”

The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.Elsewhere, Germany’s DAX is down 4.3%, France’s CAC is down 4.8%, Italy’s FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain’s IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump’s tariffs. Major UK banks have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have wreaked havoc on lenders’ share prices.The Guardian understands that lobby group UK Finance is holding a working level call with public policy staff from some of the country’s largest lenders, as they try to understand the ripple effects of US import taxes.While Trump’s tariffs are focused on physical goods rather than services, it will impact business borrowers and large corporate clients who sell products to the US.The harm caused by tariffs could dampen appetite for loans and investment banking services – which provide support for mergers, takeovers and fundraising.Tariffs could also make it harder for companies to repay their debts."
Filipino authorities are using Facebook to target young activists,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/10/philippines-authorities-using-facebook-to-red-tag-young-activists/,NGO,0.32499999999999996,,"@RebeccaHedin






Philippines authorities are increasingly using Facebook in red-tagging campaigns targeting young activists, including those who investigate alleged human rights violations by the military, police and other government agencies, Amnesty International said today in a new report. At the heart of this coordinated campaign is the practice of “red-tagging”, through which leading political figures and state security officials vilify human rights activists and other perceived opponents of the state as alleged “Communist rebels” and “terrorists.” Activists and other critical voices are being red-tagged and identified as targets by the government, and then pursued online. It’s letting people know that this person is a target, that you should not get close to this person … Of course, if you’re not yet organized, it would make you think that you wouldn’t want to be an activist because your life would be put in danger.”  Red-Tagging under successive governments

Red-tagging intensified under the administration of President Marcos Jr, with opponents targeted through Facebook posts and press statements despite his administration’s attempts to present itself as more respectful of human rights. Speaking to civil society groups, young human rights defenders and building on its own analysis of Facebook content and ads, Amnesty International found consistent failures by Meta to enforce its community guidelines and to remove red-tagging content that incites hatred and violence. Under that policy, we will remove content that exposes the identity of someone who is alleged to be a member of an ‘at-risk’ group, where these allegations could lead to real life harm.” Amnesty International researchers also analysed ads that were approved and published by Meta on its Facebook platform, using Meta’s Ad Library and found evidence of failures in human rights due diligence by the company. “Inadequate content moderation and ad approval mechanisms, and a failure to track the effectiveness of its risk mitigation measures, have turned Facebook into an enabling environment that contributes to serious human rights violations,” said Wilnor Papa, Head of Activism and Mobilization at Amnesty International Philippines. Amnesty International is urging Meta to conduct a thorough review and overhaul of its human rights due diligence processes, to ensure that it adequately scrutinizes red-tagging posts flagged by human rights defenders and to eliminate paid red-tagging content before promoting it to users of its platform. *Name changed to protect identity Stop attacks on young human rights defenders in the Philippines
