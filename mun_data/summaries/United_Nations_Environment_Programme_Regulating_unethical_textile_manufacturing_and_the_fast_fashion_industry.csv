What Fuels Fashion? : Fashion Revolution,https://www.fashionrevolution.org/transparency/,other,0.6272727272727272,,"‘What Fuels Fashion?‘ is a single-issue, special edition of our annual Fashion Transparency Index. We have reviewed 250 of the world’s largest fashion brands and retailers and ranked them according to their level of disclosure on climate and energy-related data in their own operations but primarily in their supply chains. LACK OF COMMITMENT TO DECARBONISATION
Nearly a quarter of the world’s biggest fashion brands disclose nothing on decarbonisation, signifying that the climate crisis is not a priority for them. BRANDS ARE MISSING CLIMATE TARGETS
The fashion industry is lagging significantly in achieving climate targets and reducing emissions, with 86% of companies lacking a public coal phase-out target, 94% without a public renewable energy target, and 92% without a public renewable electricity target for their supply chains. SUPPLIERS NEED FUNDING, NOT DEBT
Despite being the largest emitters with the greatest financial responsibility to decarbonise, nearly all (94%) big fashion brands fail to disclose how much they are investing in supply chain decarbonisation. However, burdening suppliers with loans to meet brand climate targets is unfair and perpetuates existing power imbalances between fashion brands, their suppliers and the people who make our clothes. FINANCING DECARBONISATION
Big fashion needs to pay for the transition from coal to clean energy but only 6% of the world’s largest fashion brands tell us how much they are spending on decarbonisation annually. Instead of investing in a fair transition away from fossil fuels like coal to renewable energy sources like wind and solar to power fashion’s supply chain in a clean way, fashion brands are shifting the costs onto the factories they work with; burdening workers and communities with fixing a problem they didn’t create. WORKERS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS
Almost no fashion brand discloses how they are engaging with workers and communities in their supply chains affected by climate breakdown; 94% of big fashion brands do not disclose how they are engaging with affected stakeholders to identify the impacts of their climate strategy and co-create local solutions and mitigations. RENEWABLE ENERGY ADVOCACY
Fashion brands have the potential to lead the clean energy transition based on their powerful economic influence in their sourcing countries and must leverage this to deliver real renewable energy capacity. 88% of brands fail to disclose any information regarding their advocacy for renewable energy, meaning it is  unclear how, or if, these brands are supporting efforts to increase access to renewable energy in areas where it is scarce or unavailable. ENERGY PROCUREMENT
Although 44% of brands disclose how they are accounting for renewable electricity, many rely on RECs and very few (10%) disclose this information at supply chain level, meaning it is unclear if brands are meaningfully decarbonising their operations and supply chains. Despite an estimated 96% of fashion’s emissions being created at manufacturing stage, it is alarming that only 8% of brands disclose a renewable electricity target for their supply chain. The majority (96%) of the world’s largest fashion brands haven’t publicly committed to a Just Transition strategy and only 4% of brands disclose their efforts to retain and re- and/or up-skill supply chain workers whose jobs are at risk. Big fashion needs to pay for the transition from coal to clean energy but only 6% of the world’s largest fashion brands tell us how much they are spending on decarbonisation annually.

This year, in place of the Global Fashion Transparency Index 2024, we have published a special edition, single-issue report titled ‘What Fuels Fashion?’. ‘What Fuels Fashion?’ is new research that Fashion Revolution has developed to spotlight major fashion brands and retailers’ progress on decarbonisation. To drive the changes we urgently need, greater transparency, reliable data and increased advocacy are crucial to push big fashion brands toward more sustainable manufacturing processes. By focusing on a single-issue, Fashion Revolution is placing significant spotlight and media attention solely on decarbonisation and major fashion brands’ performance on it, thus increasing the pressure on brands and therefore the potential for impact. ‘What Fuels Fashion?’ reviews brands’ public disclosure on climate and energy-related data in their own operations but primarily in their supply chains. The methodology for the ‘What Fuels Fashion?’ report differs significantly from that of the Global Fashion Transparency Index. Unlike previous reports that assessed the transparency of brands’ policies and commitments across various topics, this report zeroes in on assessing big fashion’s transparency and efforts in reducing carbon emissions, sourcing renewable energy, investing in decarbonisation, and supporting and advocating for just, clean and fair energy transitions for workers and communities. Other indicators are drawn from the Global Fashion Transparency Index methodology to enable some year-on-year comparisons on certain issues such as: disclosure of brands’ supplier lists, sustainable material targets and progress and production volumes; brands’ climate targets and progress and commitments to freedom of association. ‘What Fuels Fashion?’ is shining a spotlight on how much information big fashion shares about their climate efforts. ‘What Fuels Fashion?’ is designed as an index to facilitate comparisons of major brands’ and retailers’ public disclosures on their decarbonisation efforts. ‘What Fuels Fashion?’ draws on the same scope of brands reviewed in the Global Fashion Transparency Index. Fashion Revolution showcases and champions smaller and more responsible brands and designers through our Fashion Revolution Open Studios and Small But Perfect initiatives. We want to be very clear that the ‘What Fuels Fashion?’ report does not measure sustainability or ethics; it measures public disclosure of information that people can use to hold major brands and retailers to account for their claims. Fashion Revolution remains committed to ensuring all findings of ‘What Fuels Fashion?’, including a brand’s individual score or ranking, are communicated accurately and in context.

LACK OF COMMITMENT TO DECARBONISATION
Nearly a quarter of the world’s biggest fashion brands disclose nothing on decarbonisation, signifying that the climate crisis is not a priority for them. LACK OF COMMITMENT TO DECARBONISATION

SUPPLIERS NEED FUNDING, NOT DEBT
Despite being the largest emitters with the greatest financial responsibility to decarbonise, nearly all (94%) big fashion brands fail to disclose how much they are investing in supply chain decarbonisation. However, burdening suppliers with loans to meet brand climate targets is unfair and perpetuates existing power imbalances between fashion brands, their suppliers and the people who make our clothes.

FINANCING DECARBONISATION
Big fashion needs to pay for the transition from coal to clean energy but only 6% of the world’s largest fashion brands tell us how much they are spending on decarbonisation annually. Instead of investing in a fair transition away from fossil fuels like coal to renewable energy sources like wind and solar to power fashion’s supply chain in a clean way, fashion brands are shifting the costs onto the factories they work with; burdening workers and communities with fixing a problem they didn’t create.

WORKERS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS
Almost no fashion brand discloses how they are engaging with workers and communities in their supply chains affected by climate breakdown; 94% of big fashion brands do not disclose how they are engaging with affected stakeholders to identify the impacts of their climate strategy and co-create local solutions and mitigations.

RENEWABLE ENERGY ADVOCACY
Fashion brands have the potential to lead the clean energy transition based on their powerful economic influence in their sourcing countries and must leverage this to deliver real renewable energy capacity. 88% of brands fail to disclose any information regarding their advocacy for renewable energy, meaning it is  unclear how, or if, these brands are supporting efforts to increase access to renewable energy in areas where it is scarce or unavailable.

Although 44% of brands disclose how they are accounting for renewable electricity, many rely on RECs and very few (10%) disclose this information at supply chain level, meaning it is unclear if brands are meaningfully decarbonising their operations and supply chains. ENERGY PROCUREMENT

Accountability – 10% 
Decarbonisation – 40%
Energy Procurement – 15% 
Financing Decarbonisation – 15% 
Just Transition and Advocacy – 20%

‘What Fuels Fashion?’ reviews brands’ public disclosure on climate and energy-related data in their own operations but primarily in their supply chains. The methodology for the ‘What Fuels Fashion?’ report differs significantly from that of the Global Fashion Transparency Index. Unlike previous reports that assessed the transparency of brands’ policies and commitments across various topics, this report zeroes in on assessing big fashion’s transparency and efforts in reducing carbon emissions, sourcing renewable energy, investing in decarbonisation, and supporting and advocating for just, clean and fair energy transitions for workers and communities.

Tripling renewable power and doubling energy efficiency by 2030: Crucial steps towards 1.5°C,https://www.irena.org/Digital-Report/Tripling-renewable-power-and-doubling-energy-efficiency-by-2030,other,0.6181818181818182,,"KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
 




TOTAL GLOBAL RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY WILL NEED TO
TRIPLE BY 2030 to reach more than 11 000 GW under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario
in the World Energy Transitions Outlook, with solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind
power accounting for about 90% of renewable energy capacity additions. ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets
with specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building
codes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial
incentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy
efficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and
collective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in
addressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER
CAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy
Transitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges
and plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development
strategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this
would serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable
energy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in
energy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the
world back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 
The global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy
industry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,
particularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy
authorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to
triple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate
change space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the
Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet
these renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement
measures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce
exposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative
global installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual
energy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to
achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,
sustainable and modern energy for all. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable
            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far
            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing
            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability
            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up
            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in
            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and
            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera
            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency
Our mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,
            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency
            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the
            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is
            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with
            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is
            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris
            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing
            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;
            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted
            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and
            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and
            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable
            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure
            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity
            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful
            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to
            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy
            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from
the record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered
by renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer
scale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an
urgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –
particularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV
and wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021
to 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in
the current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,
including 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of
551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual
power generation capacity additions this decade. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW
average annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable
power technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately
(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential
and more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases
in renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030

Notes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;
renewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit
in developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,
many developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems
and related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable
energy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the
economic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the
competitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power
in reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of
affordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of
renewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and
wind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting
new operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response
schemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with
reservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand
with supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by
grids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of
renewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY
 




A rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also
aim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient
technologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 
) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is
largely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and
electric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised
energy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and
transportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role
in keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels
(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should
double by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International
Energy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy
security and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient
investments are made. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION
 




Wind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power
worldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse
range of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including
hydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6









Power grids
Investments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now
significantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries
need to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid
investments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system
costs of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage
With a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure
the electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal
energy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies
(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy
in chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies

Based on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or
even seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is
greater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy
grids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,
provided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are
available (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy
networks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,
2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,
workforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be
aligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently
integrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and
renewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;
shape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and
environmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,
according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the
adoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy
efficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as
access to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important
role in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies
would improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical
infrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist
those countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas
must carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable
power and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds
    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling
    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green
    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment
    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby
    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable
    energy supply chains. Policy makers must
therefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate
increasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable
energy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based
power system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become
active participants in the energy system. This will
require electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale
renewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through
connection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet
    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that
    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy
    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities
    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of
    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for
instance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year
for repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate
change through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best
practices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits
Scaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic
benefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health
improvements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated
13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of
millions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments
that may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and
policies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment
while boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of
increasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology
transfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging
markets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will
be important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the
renewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development
standards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the
interconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities
brought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more
co-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –
    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical
    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition
    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the
    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 
 




Global investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high
(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment
benefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of
the global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable
power generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in
2022. A
substantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and
innovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment
and ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear
that both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of
projects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Redirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,
    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive
    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives
    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income
    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that
    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the
    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration
International collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and
energy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to
existing multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global
renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together
through schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives
and credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and
development finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing
that can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in
which just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other
such initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure
that best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable
energy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,
as grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean
electricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy
resources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,
    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured
    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy
    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –
will need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power
accounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy
intensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C
Scenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the
provision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy
efficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:








 





INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION
POLICY AND REGULATION
SUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES
FINANCE
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION











To establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,
policy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector
planning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory
frameworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from
fossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable
distribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global
South. COP28 provides a
clear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit
to tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target. (2013), Engaging the Private Sector in Skills

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
 




TOTAL GLOBAL RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY WILL NEED TO
TRIPLE BY 2030 to reach more than 11 000 GW under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario
in the World Energy Transitions Outlook, with solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind
power accounting for about 90% of renewable energy capacity additions. ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets
with specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building
codes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial
incentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy
efficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and
collective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in
addressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER
CAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy
Transitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges
and plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development
strategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this
would serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable
energy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in
energy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the
world back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 
The global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy
industry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,
particularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy
authorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to
triple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate
change space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the
Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet
these renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement
measures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce
exposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative
global installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual
energy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to
achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,
sustainable and modern energy for all. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable
            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far
            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing
            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability
            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up
            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in
            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and
            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera
            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency
Our mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,
            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency
            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the
            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is
            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with
            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is
            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris
            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing
            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;
            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted
            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and
            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and
            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable
            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure
            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity
            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful
            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to
            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy
            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from
the record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered
by renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer
scale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an
urgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –
particularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV
and wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021
to 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in
the current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,
including 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of
551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual
power generation capacity additions this decade. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW
average annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable
power technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately
(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential
and more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases
in renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030

Notes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;
renewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit
in developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,
many developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems
and related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable
energy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the
economic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the
competitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power
in reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of
affordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of
renewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and
wind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting
new operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response
schemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with
reservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand
with supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by
grids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of
renewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY
 




A rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also
aim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient
technologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 
) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is
largely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and
electric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised
energy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and
transportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role
in keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels
(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should
double by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International
Energy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy
security and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient
investments are made. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION
 




Wind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power
worldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse
range of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including
hydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6









Power grids
Investments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now
significantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries
need to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid
investments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system
costs of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage
With a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure
the electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal
energy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies
(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy
in chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies

Based on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or
even seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is
greater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy
grids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,
provided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are
available (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy
networks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,
2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,
workforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be
aligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently
integrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and
renewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;
shape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and
environmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,
according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the
adoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy
efficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as
access to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important
role in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies
would improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical
infrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist
those countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas
must carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable
power and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds
    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling
    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green
    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment
    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby
    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable
    energy supply chains. Policy makers must
therefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate
increasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable
energy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based
power system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become
active participants in the energy system. This will
require electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale
renewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through
connection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet
    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that
    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy
    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities
    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of
    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for
instance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year
for repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate
change through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best
practices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits
Scaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic
benefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health
improvements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated
13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of
millions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments
that may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and
policies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment
while boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of
increasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology
transfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging
markets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will
be important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the
renewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development
standards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the
interconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities
brought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more
co-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –
    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical
    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition
    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the
    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 
 




Global investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high
(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment
benefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of
the global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable
power generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in
2022. A
substantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and
innovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment
and ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear
that both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of
projects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Redirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,
    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive
    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives
    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income
    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that
    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the
    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration
International collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and
energy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to
existing multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global
renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together
through schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives
and credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and
development finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing
that can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in
which just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other
such initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure
that best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable
energy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,
as grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean
electricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy
resources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,
    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured
    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy
    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –
will need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power
accounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy
intensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C
Scenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the
provision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy
efficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:








 





INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION
POLICY AND REGULATION
SUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES
FINANCE
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION











To establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,
policy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector
planning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory
frameworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from
fossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable
distribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global
South. COP28 provides a
clear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit
to tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target. (2013), Engaging the Private Sector in Skills

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
 




TOTAL GLOBAL RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY WILL NEED TO
TRIPLE BY 2030 to reach more than 11 000 GW under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario
in the World Energy Transitions Outlook, with solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind
power accounting for about 90% of renewable energy capacity additions. ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets
with specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building
codes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial
incentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy
efficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and
collective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in
addressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER
CAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy
Transitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges
and plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development
strategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this
would serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable
energy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in
energy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the
world back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 
The global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy
industry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,
particularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy
authorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to
triple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate
change space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the
Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet
these renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement
measures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce
exposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative
global installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual
energy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to
achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,
sustainable and modern energy for all. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable
            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far
            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing
            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability
            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up
            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in
            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and
            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera
            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency
Our mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,
            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency
            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the
            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is
            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with
            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is
            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris
            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing
            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;
            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted
            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and
            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and
            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable
            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure
            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity
            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful
            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to
            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy
            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from
the record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered
by renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer
scale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an
urgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –
particularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV
and wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021
to 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in
the current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,
including 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). With average annual additions of
551 GW of solar PV and 329 GW of wind power to 2030, solar PV and wind power would dominate annual
power generation capacity additions this decade. Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW
average annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable
power technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately
(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential
and more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases
in renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030

Notes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;
renewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit
in developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,
many developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems
and related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable
energy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the
economic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the
competitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power
in reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of
affordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of
renewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and
wind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting
new operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response
schemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with
reservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand
with supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by
grids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of
renewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY
 




A rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also
aim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient
technologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 
) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is
largely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and
electric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised
energy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and
transportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role
in keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels
(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should
double by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International
Energy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy
security and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient
investments are made. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION
 




Wind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power
worldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse
range of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including
hydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6









Power grids
Investments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now
significantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries
need to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid
investments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system
costs of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage
With a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure
the electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal
energy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies
(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy
in chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies

Based on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or
even seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is
greater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy
grids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,
provided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are
available (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy
networks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,
2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,
workforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be
aligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently
integrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and
renewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;
shape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and
environmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,
according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the
adoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy
efficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as
access to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important
role in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies
would improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical
infrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist
those countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas
must carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable
power and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds
    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling
    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green
    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment
    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby
    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable
    energy supply chains. Policy makers must
therefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate
increasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable
energy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based
power system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become
active participants in the energy system. This will
require electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale
renewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through
connection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet
    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that
    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy
    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities
    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of
    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for
instance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year
for repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate
change through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best
practices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits
Scaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic
benefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health
improvements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated
13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of
millions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments
that may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and
policies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment
while boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of
increasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology
transfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging
markets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will
be important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the
renewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development
standards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the
interconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities
brought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more
co-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –
    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical
    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition
    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the
    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 
 




Global investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high
(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment
benefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of
the global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable
power generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in
2022. A
substantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and
innovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment
and ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear
that both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of
projects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Redirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,
    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive
    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives
    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income
    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that
    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the
    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration
International collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and
energy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to
existing multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global
renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together
through schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives
and credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and
development finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing
that can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in
which just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other
such initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure
that best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable
energy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,
as grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean
electricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy
resources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,
    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured
    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy
    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –
will need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power
accounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy
intensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C
Scenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the
provision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy
efficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:








 





INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION
POLICY AND REGULATION
SUPPLY CHAINS, SKILLS AND CAPACITIES
FINANCE
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION











To establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,
policy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector
planning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory
frameworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from
fossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable
distribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global
South. COP28 provides a
clear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit
to tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target. (2013), Engaging the Private Sector in Skills

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
 




TOTAL GLOBAL RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY WILL NEED TO
TRIPLE BY 2030 to reach more than 11 000 GW under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario
in the World Energy Transitions Outlook, with solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind
power accounting for about 90% of renewable energy capacity additions. ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets
with specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building
codes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial
incentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy
efficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and
collective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in
addressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER
CAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy
Transitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges
and plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development
strategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this
would serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable
energy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in
energy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the
world back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 
The global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy
industry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,
particularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy
authorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to
triple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate
change space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the
Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet
these renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement
measures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce
exposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative
global installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual
energy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to
achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,
sustainable and modern energy for all. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable
            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far
            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing
            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability
            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up
            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in
            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and
            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera
            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency
Our mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,
            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency
            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the
            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is
            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with
            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is
            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris
            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing
            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;
            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted
            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and
            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and
            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable
            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure
            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity
            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful
            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to
            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy
            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from
the record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered
by renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer
scale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an
urgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –
particularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV
and wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021
to 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in
the current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,
including 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW
average annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable
power technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately
(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential
and more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases
in renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030

Notes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;
renewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit
in developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,
many developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems
and related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable
energy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the
economic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the
competitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power
in reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of
affordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of
renewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and
wind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting
new operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response
schemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with
reservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand
with supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by
grids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of
renewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY
 




A rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also
aim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient
technologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 
) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is
largely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and
electric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised
energy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and
transportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role
in keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels
(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should
double by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International
Energy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy
security and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient
investments are made. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION
 




Wind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power
worldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse
range of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including
hydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6









Power grids
Investments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now
significantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries
need to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid
investments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system
costs of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage
With a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure
the electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal
energy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies
(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy
in chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies

Based on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or
even seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is
greater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy
grids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,
provided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are
available (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy
networks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,
2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,
workforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be
aligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently
integrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and
renewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;
shape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and
environmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,
according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the
adoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy
efficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as
access to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important
role in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies
would improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical
infrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist
those countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas
must carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable
power and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds
    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling
    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green
    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment
    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby
    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable
    energy supply chains. Policy makers must
therefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate
increasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable
energy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based
power system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become
active participants in the energy system. This will
require electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale
renewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through
connection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet
    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that
    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy
    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities
    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of
    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for
instance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year
for repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate
change through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best
practices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits
Scaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic
benefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health
improvements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated
13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of
millions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments
that may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and
policies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment
while boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of
increasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology
transfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging
markets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will
be important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the
renewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development
standards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the
interconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities
brought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more
co-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –
    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical
    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition
    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the
    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 
 




Global investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high
(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment
benefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of
the global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable
power generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in
2022. A
substantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and
innovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment
and ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear
that both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of
projects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Redirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,
    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive
    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives
    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income
    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that
    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the
    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration
International collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and
energy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to
existing multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global
renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together
through schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives
and credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and
development finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing
that can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in
which just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other
such initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure
that best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable
energy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,
as grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean
electricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy
resources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,
    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured
    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy
    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –
will need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power
accounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy
intensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C
Scenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the
provision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy
efficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:

policy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector
planning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory
frameworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from
fossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable
distribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global
South. COP28 provides a
clear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit
to tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target. (2013), Engaging the Private Sector in Skills

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
 




TOTAL GLOBAL RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY WILL NEED TO
TRIPLE BY 2030 to reach more than 11 000 GW under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario
in the World Energy Transitions Outlook, with solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind
power accounting for about 90% of renewable energy capacity additions. ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY MEASURES should include: the adoption of targets
with specific time horizons; strong regulatory frameworks including building
codes and energy efficiency standards for appliances; fiscal and financial
incentives; and public campaigns to build awareness of the role of energy
efficiency measures, public transport and green mobility for cost savings and
collective decarbonisation goals. RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITY SHOULD BE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, given their growing electricity demand and the important role of renewables in
addressing the significant energy access deficit in these countries. WE MUST RAPIDLY MOBILISE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE TO TRIPLE RENEWABLE POWER
CAPACITY AND DOUBLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IRENA’s flagship report, World Energy
Transitions Outlook 2023: 1.5°C pathway, shows that even if current pledges
and plans made by national governments – including Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development
strategies (LT-LEDS) and other commitments – are fully implemented, this
would serve to reduce CO2 emissions by only 6% in 2030 compared to 2022 levels. The World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 concludes that a significant acceleration in the deployment of renewable
energy, energy storage and renewable fuels, coupled with tangible progress in
energy efficiency and electrification of end-use sectors, are required to put the
world back on track in this decade to meet global climate goals (IRENA, 2023a). 1 
The global energy transition requires a significant reduction in carbon emissions across the entire energy
industry, as well as in end-use sectors. Greater ambition and stronger collective action are immediately required to accelerate progress,
particularly in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Against this backdrop, policy makers, energy
authorities, industry and civil society have an opportunity to align at COP28 to agree global targets to
triple renewable power generation capacity and double the energy efficiency improvement rate by 2030. It represents global perspectives within the renewable energy and climate
change space, with the COP28 Presidency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the
Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) uniting to provide concrete recommendations on the means to meet
these renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Accelerating progress in renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvement
measures this decade would contribute to a cleaner energy system, improve energy security and reduce
exposure – both in industry and for consumers – to the damaging risks of highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Realising the targets, in accordance with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, would require a cumulative
global installed renewable electricity generation capacity of over 11 000 GW, and a doubling of the annual
energy efficiency improvement rate from the current level by 2030 (IRENA, 2023a). Providing renewable energy to those populations would contribute significantly to
achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 to Ensure access to affordable, reliable,
sustainable and modern energy for all. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability
            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up
            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in

            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera
            Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency
Our mission is as clear as it is urgent: to keep the 1.5°C target within reach,
            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency
            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the
            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is
            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with
            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is
            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris
            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing
            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;
            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted
            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and
            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and
            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable
            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure
            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity
            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful
            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to
            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy
            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable
            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far

            we must triple renewable power capacity and double energy efficiency
            by 2030. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook, which provides the
            analytical foundation for this report, warns that the energy transition is
            dangerously off-track, demanding immediate, radical collective action. A significant acceleration of renewable energy deployment, coupled with
            tangible progress in energy efficiency and end-use electrification, is
            essential to put the world back on track to achieve the goals of the Paris
            Agreement. We must now focus on building the necessary infrastructure and investing
            at scale in grids to accommodate a growing share of renewable energy;
            establish policy and regulatory architecture that can facilitate targeted
            public and private sector investments in the energy transition; and
            strategically realign institutional capacities to help ensure skills and
            capabilities match the energy system of the future. A global energy transition that accelerates renewable
            energy and phases out fossil fuels is the only way to build a clean, secure
            and just future. Double down, triple up: Tripling global renewable energy capacity
            and doubling energy efficiency rates by 2030 are the most impactful
            commitments we can undertake now to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. This would set the stage to
            scale long-duration energy storage and green hydrogen, ensuring energy
            systems are not just clean, but secure and resilient. The world has already made great strides by expanding global renewable
            energy capacity and becoming more energy efficient; but progress so far
            has been too slow. To deliver a just and orderly energy transition while advancing
            socio-economic development and ensuring energy affordability, reliability
            and sustainability, we must rapidly accelerate our efforts to ramp up
            renewable energy. Ahead of COP28, we are building global momentum and consensus in
            support of our target to triple global renewable power generation and
            double energy efficiency. Francesco La Camera

the record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered
by renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer
scale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an
urgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –
particularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV
and wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021
to 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in
the current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,
including 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW
average annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable
power technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately
(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential
and more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases
in renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030

Notes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;
renewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit
in developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,
many developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems
and related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable
energy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the
economic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the
competitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power
in reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of
affordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of
renewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and
wind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting
new operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response
schemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with
reservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand
with supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by
grids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of
renewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. ENERGY EFFICIENCY
 




A rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also
aim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient
technologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 
) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is
largely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and
electric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised
energy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and
transportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role
in keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels
(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should
double by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International
Energy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy
security and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient
investments are made. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from

in renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. FIGURE 2 Global installed renewable electricity generation capacity in the 1.5°C Scenario, 2022 and 2030

Notes: CSP = concentrated solar power; GW = gigawatt; PV = photovoltaic; VRE = variable renewable energy. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;
renewables can – and should – play an important role in addressing the significant energy access deficit
in developing countries, through both grid and off-grid applications. Currently, despite vast potential,
many developing countries are lagging behind in terms of their deployment of renewable power systems
and related investments; for instance, of the cumulative investment of USD 2 841 billion in renewable
energy in 2000–2020 worldwide, Africa only received USD 60 billion, or 2% (IRENA and AfDB, 2022). Accelerating renewable power deployment is not only beneficial from a climate perspective; the
economic case for this acceleration is now compelling, given the dramatic improvements in the
competitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. It is equally important to consider the wider economic and environmental benefits of renewable power
in reducing fossil fuel imports, improving a country’s balance of payments and enhancing security of
affordable energy supply by reducing exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices in global markets. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the power systems of tomorrow would integrate a broad range of
renewable sources, with each technology playing a key role in meeting electricity demand; but solar and
wind power will dominate capacity expansion. These may be met by adopting
new operational strategies and mechanisms, accelerating the scale-up of smart demand response
schemes and deploying technologies that support power system flexibility, including hydropower with
reservoirs and pumped storage; energy storage; and sector coupling technologies. Hydrogen has also been recognised as an energy carrier that can be used to balance electricity demand
with supply from variable renewable energy, thereby providing the increasing flexibility required by
grids. Scaling up green hydrogen therefore offers significant potential for integrating higher shares of
renewable energy in grids, and can also provide a solution for seasonal energy storage. According to IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023, global energy-related CO2 emissions would need to decline significantly to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) in 2030, from
the record high of 36.8 GtCO2 in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). It concludes that energy efficiency and electrification powered
by renewables, clean hydrogen and direct use of renewables are driving the transition; but the sheer
scale and extent of this transition requires a rapid and systemic transformation of the energy system. The energy transition requires an
urgent and significant acceleration across energy supply, end-use sectors and enabling technologies –
particularly the deployment of renewable power generation systems in more countries and regions. The share of variable renewable energy (VRE) – such as solar PV
and wind power – in electricity generation would rise from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021
to 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system. This suggests average renewable energy capacity additions of approximately 1 000 GW each year in
the current decade – more than three times the installed renewable capacity added in 2022 (292 GW,
including 189 GW of solar and 73 GW of wind power) (IRENA, 2023c). Given that annual installation levels in 2022 were less than one-third of the 1 000 GW
average annual installation rate required to 2030 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, growth of renewable
power technologies over the remaining period of this decade will need to accelerate immediately
(IRENA, 2023a). Those with lower barriers to investment, higher renewable energy resource potential
and more mature power markets – among other key enabling factors – should aim for greater increases
in renewable capacity and economy decarbonisation. It is important that renewable power generation capacity, including both grid-connected and off-grid systems, expands more rapidly in the developing world, given its growing electricity demand;

A rapid scale-up in renewables is only part of the energy transition equation. The transition should also
aim to deliver reduced energy intensity across the economy through a range of more energy efficient
technologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy efficiency (measured in terms of energy intensity improvement rates 3 
) in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario is
largely a result of a combination of efficient technologies in end-use sectors and extensive electrification. Technical energy efficiency improvements embodied by heat pumps, more efficient appliances and
electric vehicles – together with flexible, smart electrification strategies and deployment of decentralised
energy – are of tremendous importance in decarbonising end-use sectors such as buildings and
transportation. For industrial sectors, continued energy efficiency improvements play an important role
in keeping the overall energy consumption by industry close to unchanged in 2050 from present levels
(IRENA, 2023a). To align with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global annual rate of energy intensity improvement should
double by 2030 from the current level, which is also in line with the assessment of the International
Energy Agency (IEA, 2023). With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments as well as energy
security and energy affordability objectives, governments must redouble their efforts to ensure sufficient
investments are made. ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Wind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power
worldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse
range of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including
hydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6









Power grids
Investments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now
significantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries
need to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid
investments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system
costs of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Energy storage
With a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure
the electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal
energy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies
(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy
in chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies

Based on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or
even seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is
greater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy
grids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,
provided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are
available (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy
networks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,
2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,
workforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be
aligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently
integrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and
renewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;
shape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and
environmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,
according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the
adoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy
efficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as
access to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important
role in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies
would improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical
infrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist
those countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas
must carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable
power and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds
    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling
    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green
    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment
    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby
    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable
    energy supply chains. Policy makers must
therefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate
increasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable
energy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based
power system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become
active participants in the energy system. This will
require electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale
renewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through
connection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet
    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that
    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy
    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities
    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of
    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for
instance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year
for repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate
change through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best
practices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits
Scaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic
benefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health
improvements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated
13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of
millions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments
that may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and
policies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment
while boosting support for local energy transitions. As countries usher in large industrial policy packages for the energy transition, there is a risk of
increasing barriers in the global exchange of renewable energy knowledge, innovation and technology
transfer – all of which will be essential for a cost-effective and fair transition, particularly for emerging
markets and developing economies. Multilateral alignment of supply chain, trade and industrial policies for the energy transition will
be important in creating unified standards and investment protocols that can channel capital to the
renewables sector and nascent green hydrogen sector, and encourage best-in-class development
standards. Fostering a broader understanding in the public sector of the
interconnected nature of the energy transition, and the cascade effect of decarbonisation opportunities
brought by a ramp-up of renewable electricity, can help to avoid knowledge silos and create more
co-ordinated policy across different pillars of government. Provide capacity-building opportunities to a broad range of public sector departments –
    from energy to transport and industry – to foster a more comprehensive policy and technical
    understanding of different elements of the energy transition. Build the talent pipeline by ensuring young people are exposed to renewable energy and transition
    career opportunities early in their education; and foster increased participation of women in the
    energy sector workforce. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8 
 




Global investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high
(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment
benefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of
the global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable
power generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in
2022. A
substantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and
innovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment
and ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear
that both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of
projects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Redirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,
    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive
    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives
    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income
    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that
    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the
    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration
International collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and
energy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to
existing multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global
renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together
through schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives
and credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and
development finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing
that can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in
which just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other
such initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure
that best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable
energy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,
as grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean
electricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy
resources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,
    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured
    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy
    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION

Based on: (LDES Council and McKinsey & Co., 2021)

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) provides the means to store energy for hours, 6 days, weeks or
even seasons when renewable generation is abundant relative to load, and releasing it when demand is
greater than generation (e.g. Sector coupling (integrating electricity grids, transport systems, heating in buildings and thermal energy
grids) provides more opportunities to economically optimise overall operation as a single system,
provided that the economic incentives are put in place and upgraded energy management systems are
available (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). This would enable increased integration of variable renewable electricity in local energy
networks and maximise overall benefits by automating the monitoring and operation of assets (IRENA,
2021a; IRENA Coalition for Action, 2022). INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OPERATION

Wind and solar power are the fastest growing sources of power
worldwide, but there is also a need to accommodate a more diverse
range of renewable energy sources in the power mix – including
hydropower with reservoir storage and biomass-based power plants. FIGURE 6

Power grids
Investments in the electricity grid have lagged behind those in renewable power and must now
significantly ramp up in anticipation of the considerable renewable power additions required. Countries
need to prepare for the large amounts of VRE that will come online in the next few decades, as grid
investments must be made 3-5 years before renewable energy investments to mitigate the overall system
costs of greater renewable penetration (LBNL, 2022). Power grids

With a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage is needed to ensure
the electricity generated is successfully delivered when shortfalls between supply and demand occur. However, there are now many types of storage, including electro-chemical storage (batteries), thermal
energy storage (which employs rocks, bricks or molten salts to store heat), mechanical technologies
(employing compressed air, liquid air or gravitational potential) and chemical storage (storing energy
in chemical bonds such as hydrogen or its derivatives). FIGURE 7: Long duration energy storage technologies

workforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be
aligned with overall climate and renewable energy targets to ensure renewable power can be efficiently
integrated and dispatched to areas of demand. This section focuses on the key policies and regulations needed to accelerate energy efficiency and
renewable power technologies; phase down fossil fuel generation and replace inefficient equipment;
shape power market design to integrate higher shares of renewables; and maximise social and
environmental benefits. Improving energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency could deliver around a quarter of the emissions reductions needed by 2050,
according to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Awareness campaigns for end-users also play an important role in the
adoption of energy efficiency and energy conservation measures. Rising fossil fuel prices have acted as an important catalyst for energy efficiency measures; yet, energy
efficiency improvements and renewables deployment still face financial and other obstacles, such as
access to capital or long pay-back periods. Fiscal and regulatory incentives therefore play an important
role in accelerating the deployment of both renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Such policies
would improve the economic competitiveness of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. Countries with fiscal restraints can benefit from donor finance to support building capacity and physical
infrastructure for the integration of renewable power, among other important aspects that would assist
those countries in advancing the energy transition. However, any trade-offs in these areas
must carefully consider the risk of non-delivery, given the very tight timeline to achieve the renewable
power and energy efficiency targets for 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure fiscal policy prioritises equity in the energy transition, for instance by investing proceeds
    from taxes on fossil fuel energy production and carbon pricing mechanisms in enabling
    infrastructure, or supplementing clean electricity access for low-income populations via green
    financing schemes and other instruments. Ensure procurement schemes, including tenders, provide adequate price signals for investment
    and balance long-term price/cost risk mitigation with socio-economic value creation, thereby
    providing cost-efficient electricity, and enabling forward-planning and investment in renewable
    energy supply chains. Policy makers must
therefore urgently create the enabling conditions for power grid and system flexibility to integrate
increasing shares of wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. This holistic model would incentivise continued investment in large-scale, capital-intensive renewable
energy projects, while assuring the flexibility needed for a resilient and reliable renewables-based
power system. To achieve the energy transition, individuals, communities and businesses will also need to become
active participants in the energy system. This will
require electrical grids that allow energy consumers to easily install and utilise small- to mid-scale
renewable energy projects to cover their consumption, and/or inject power into the grid through
connection schemes like net-metering and feed-in-tariffs. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Ensure price signals encourage sufficient investment in additional renewable capacity to meet
    climate and energy transition targets; and adopt renewable power procurement approaches that
    recognise the net benefits and costs of social, environmental, system integration and energy
    security factors. Create a capacity market for flexibility services (including ancillary services and storage capacities
    of varying duration) with a long time horizon aligned to targeted renewable energy penetration of
    the power mix. Revisions to the EU Renewable Energy Directive in 2023, for
instance, set a maximum two-year lead time for permitting new renewables projects, and one year
for repowering (refurbishing or replacing) wind and solar projects. The Planning for Climate Commission has produced a nine-point plan for tackling climate
change through fast and fair permitting for renewable energy and green hydrogen that provides best
practices and can be consulted by policy makers worldwide (GHO, 2023). Reducing negative impacts; maximising social and environmental benefits
Scaling up renewable energy deployment provides an opportunity to create widespread socio-economic
benefits for communities around the world, including energy access, job creation, public health
improvements and welfare generation. Renewable energy employment worldwide grew to an estimated
13.7 million direct and indirect jobs in 2022 (IRENA and ILO, 2023); under the 1.5°C pathway, tens of
millions of additional jobs could be generated worldwide by 2030 (IRENA Coalition for Action, 2023). The energy transition will bring benefits to any economy, but also challenges in the form of misalignments
that may occur in finance, the labour force and the energy sector itself. Under the right conditions and
policies, citizen and community participation in renewable energy projects can accelerate deployment
while boosting support for local energy transitions. Planning for transmission infrastructure, inter-regional power trading,
workforce recruitment and training, flexibility services and end-use sector decarbonisation should all be

Global investment in energy transition technologies reached USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 9  – a new record high
(IRENA and CPI, 2023). For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment
benefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of
the global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable
power generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in
2022. A
substantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and
innovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment
and ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear
that both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of
projects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Redirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,
    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive
    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives
    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income
    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that
    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the
    Global South. Enhancing international collaboration
International collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and
energy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to
existing multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global
renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together
through schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives
and credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and
development finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing
that can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in
which just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other
such initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure
that best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable
energy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,
as grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean
electricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy
resources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,
    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured
    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy
    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. SCALING-UP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCE 8

that both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of
projects by 2030. For instance, around 85% of global renewable energy investment
benefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Sub-Saharan Africa received less than 1% of
the global total in the past two years (IRENA and CPI, 2023). To achieve a tripling of renewable power capacity by 2030, the annual average investment in renewable
power generation in the 2023-2030 period would need to reach USD 1 300 billion, compared to 486 billion in
2022. A
substantial increase in public funding (especially in developing countries), along with interventions and
innovations across fiscal, financial and regulatory policy are needed to drive cross-sector investment
and ensure a sufficiently large pipeline of bankable renewable energy and storage projects. While there is no shortage of capital to meet current rates of renewable energy deployment, it is clear
that both public and private finance must expand significantly to support a 1.5°C-compliant pipeline of
projects by 2030. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS
 





Redirect public capital flows from the fossil fuels sector – including direct investments, subsidies,
    export credit guarantees and concessional financing – to renewable energy and supportive
    infrastructure (including grid and transmission modernisation). Direct the proceeds of fossil fuel taxation and carbon pricing mechanisms towards initiatives
    that support a just and inclusive energy transition, such as targeted support for lower income
    households and the provision of energy access. For Global North countries, actively engage in international climate finance frameworks that
    support the equitable distribution of renewable energy investment and technologies across the
    Global South. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS

International collaboration is essential in the effort to reach global targets for renewable energy and
energy efficiency by 2030. Mobilising capital through enhanced energy and climate finance mechanisms – from green bonds to
existing multilateral development banks – will be vital to meeting the investment needs of the global
renewable power and energy efficiency targets. Public and private sector actors should work together
through schemes and organisations like the Climate Bonds Initiative to improve blended finance initiatives
and credibility in renewable energy and climate finance flows, while multilateral development banks and
development finance institutions can co-operate on risk mitigation instruments and innovative financing
that can drive a phase-down of fossil fuels in parallel with accelerating renewables. The way in
which just energy transition funds – such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) or other
such initiatives – are structured is critical. International collaboration on renewable energy research and innovation will also be important to ensure
that best-in-class technology and practices are being deployed not only in mature markets for renewable
energy, but also frontier markets. Finally, the development of regional power grids remains fertile ground for multilateral co-operation,
as grid access planning can support the growth and integration of large volumes of renewable energy. The ASEAN regional power grid project provides an example of how countries with a surplus of clean
electricity are exploring opportunities to trade with neighbouring countries that lack renewable energy
resources (IRENA, 2022b; SEADS, 2023). Enhancing international collaboration

Encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration on climate finance and renewable energy investment,
    resilient global supply chains for renewable energy, and grid connectivity. Ensure just transition funds and programmes that crowd in international finance are well structured
    to support communities in the transition and contribute to virtuous cycles of renewable energy
    deployment and climate-resilient industrial growth. URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS

will need to more than triple from the 2022 level under the 1.5°C Scenario, with solar PV and wind power
accounting for about 90% of the renewable energy capacity additions between now and 2030. The global annual rate of energy
intensity improvement would need to double by 2030 from the current level under the IRENA 1.5°C
Scenario, helping to curb the growth of global final energy consumption without compromising the
provision of energy services. This report has identified five key enablers for the required scale up in renewable power and energy
efficiency, with concrete and urgent recommendations for policy makers in each area:

To establish a more effective enabling environment for both the private sector and individuals to act,
policy makers need to lead by setting ambitious and concrete targets, implementing cross-sector
planning across the economy, providing fiscal incentives/disincentives and improving regulatory
frameworks and efficiency. Public funding will need to be redirected from
fossil fuels to energy transition technologies and infrastructure, whilst ensuring a more equitable
distribution of investments and renewable energy installations between the Global North and the Global
South. COP28 provides a
clear opportunity for world leaders to step up and agree new targets in two key areas: we must commit
to tripling renewable power capacity and doubling energy efficiency to reach the 1.5°C target. Total global renewable power generation capacity – a key energy transition driver on the supply side –

🔥 You can’t get “crazy low” prices without worker exploitation 🔥

Because billions in profits somehow isn’t enough, Amazon is now competing with Shein to make fashion even cheaper, faster and exploitative with its US beta discount store. The Shein/Temu model is bad enough on its own - now it’s being turbocharged by Amazon, a brand that:

1️⃣ Never paid the Hulu Garment workers in Cambodia in 2020

2️⃣ Refuses to sign a safety agreement that protects garment workers in Bangladesh & Pakistan

3️⃣ Has a highly documented history of union busting

‼️ Take action: tell Amazon to #PayYourWorkers using our quick email template: https://lnkd.in/dWKi3Xj

“There has never been a more important moment to make our actions count” - Tansy Hoskins ✊💕

A huge thank you to everyone who came along to our Women’s History Month panel earlier this week. Women are at the forefront of this resistance - we heard from four remarkable women in our network who are fighting for garment workers’ rights:

📣 Mirjana Obradović, a former garment worker who recounted her struggle to secure unpaid severance from a German brand and urged consumers to support garment workers’ demands

📣 Zehra Khan, a political activist who shared her incredible journey of founding Pakistan’s first trade union for home-based workers, lobbying for the Sindh Home-based Workers Act and bringing the Accord to Pakistan

📣 CCC’s very own Niki Gamara who explained the life-changing work the Urgent Appeals team do supporting garment workers to report and demand remediation for a factory floor violation, and seek solidarity from the global network

📣 Tansy Hoskins, an investigative journalist and author who made a passionate plea to see ourselves as so much more as consumers, find our place in the movement and donate to the Clean Clothes Campaign

While their stories differed, our panellists were united in their conviction that collective action is the best route to justice. ▶️ Watch the recording here: https://lnkd.in/e-DfGMVS

We’re beyond grateful for your support 💚

🔥 You can’t get “crazy low” prices without worker exploitation 🔥

Because billions in profits somehow isn’t enough, Amazon is now competing with Shein to make fashion even cheaper, faster and exploitative with its US beta discount store. The Shein/Temu model is bad enough on its own - now it’s being turbocharged by Amazon, a brand that:

1️⃣ Never paid the Hulu Garment workers in Cambodia in 2020

2️⃣ Refuses to sign a safety agreement that protects garment workers in Bangladesh & Pakistan

3️⃣ Has a highly documented history of union busting

‼️ Take action: tell Amazon to #PayYourWorkers using our quick email template: https://lnkd.in/dWKi3Xj

“There has never been a more important moment to make our actions count” - Tansy Hoskins ✊💕

A huge thank you to everyone who came along to our Women’s History Month panel earlier this week. Women are at the forefront of this resistance - we heard from four remarkable women in our network who are fighting for garment workers’ rights:

📣 Mirjana Obradović, a former garment worker who recounted her struggle to secure unpaid severance from a German brand and urged consumers to support garment workers’ demands

📣 Zehra Khan, a political activist who shared her incredible journey of founding Pakistan’s first trade union for home-based workers, lobbying for the Sindh Home-based Workers Act and bringing the Accord to Pakistan

📣 CCC’s very own Niki Gamara who explained the life-changing work the Urgent Appeals team do supporting garment workers to report and demand remediation for a factory floor violation, and seek solidarity from the global network

📣 Tansy Hoskins, an investigative journalist and author who made a passionate plea to see ourselves as so much more as consumers, find our place in the movement and donate to the Clean Clothes Campaign

While their stories differed, our panellists were united in their conviction that collective action is the best route to justice. ▶️ Watch the recording here: https://lnkd.in/e-DfGMVS

We’re beyond grateful for your support 💚

🔥 You can’t get “crazy low” prices without worker exploitation 🔥

Because billions in profits somehow isn’t enough, Amazon is now competing with Shein to make fashion even cheaper, faster and exploitative with its US beta discount store. The Shein/Temu model is bad enough on its own - now it’s being turbocharged by Amazon, a brand that:

1️⃣ Never paid the Hulu Garment workers in Cambodia in 2020

2️⃣ Refuses to sign a safety agreement that protects garment workers in Bangladesh & Pakistan

3️⃣ Has a highly documented history of union busting

‼️ Take action: tell Amazon to #PayYourWorkers using our quick email template: https://lnkd.in/dWKi3Xj

“There has never been a more important moment to make our actions count” - Tansy Hoskins ✊💕

A huge thank you to everyone who came along to our Women’s History Month panel earlier this week. Women are at the forefront of this resistance - we heard from four remarkable women in our network who are fighting for garment workers’ rights:

📣 Mirjana Obradović, a former garment worker who recounted her struggle to secure unpaid severance from a German brand and urged consumers to support garment workers’ demands

📣 Zehra Khan, a political activist who shared her incredible journey of founding Pakistan’s first trade union for home-based workers, lobbying for the Sindh Home-based Workers Act and bringing the Accord to Pakistan

📣 CCC’s very own Niki Gamara who explained the life-changing work the Urgent Appeals team do supporting garment workers to report and demand remediation for a factory floor violation, and seek solidarity from the global network

📣 Tansy Hoskins, an investigative journalist and author who made a passionate plea to see ourselves as so much more as consumers, find our place in the movement and donate to the Clean Clothes Campaign

While their stories differed, our panellists were united in their conviction that collective action is the best route to justice. ▶️ Watch the recording here: https://lnkd.in/e-DfGMVS

🔥 You can’t get “crazy low” prices without worker exploitation 🔥

Because billions in profits somehow isn’t enough, Amazon is now competing with Shein to make fashion even cheaper, faster and exploitative with its US beta discount store. The Shein/Temu model is bad enough on its own - now it’s being turbocharged by Amazon, a brand that:

1️⃣ Never paid the Hulu Garment workers in Cambodia in 2020

2️⃣ Refuses to sign a safety agreement that protects garment workers in Bangladesh & Pakistan

3️⃣ Has a highly documented history of union busting

‼️ Take action: tell Amazon to #PayYourWorkers using our quick email template: https://lnkd.in/dWKi3Xj

“There has never been a more important moment to make our actions count” - Tansy Hoskins ✊💕

A huge thank you to everyone who came along to our Women’s History Month panel earlier this week. Women are at the forefront of this resistance - we heard from four remarkable women in our network who are fighting for garment workers’ rights:

📣 Mirjana Obradović, a former garment worker who recounted her struggle to secure unpaid severance from a German brand and urged consumers to support garment workers’ demands

📣 Zehra Khan, a political activist who shared her incredible journey of founding Pakistan’s first trade union for home-based workers, lobbying for the Sindh Home-based Workers Act and bringing the Accord to Pakistan

📣 CCC’s very own Niki Gamara who explained the life-changing work the Urgent Appeals team do supporting garment workers to report and demand remediation for a factory floor violation, and seek solidarity from the global network

📣 Tansy Hoskins, an investigative journalist and author who made a passionate plea to see ourselves as so much more as consumers, find our place in the movement and donate to the Clean Clothes Campaign

While their stories differed, our panellists were united in their conviction that collective action is the best route to justice. ▶️ Watch the recording here: https://lnkd.in/e-DfGMVS

🔥 You can’t get “crazy low” prices without worker exploitation 🔥

Because billions in profits somehow isn’t enough, Amazon is now competing with Shein to make fashion even cheaper, faster and exploitative with its US beta discount store. The Shein/Temu model is bad enough on its own - now it’s being turbocharged by Amazon, a brand that:

1️⃣ Never paid the Hulu Garment workers in Cambodia in 2020

2️⃣ Refuses to sign a safety agreement that protects garment workers in Bangladesh & Pakistan

3️⃣ Has a highly documented history of union busting

‼️ Take action: tell Amazon to #PayYourWorkers using our quick email template: https://lnkd.in/dWKi3Xj

2️⃣ Zehra Khan, a political activist who founded Pakistan’s first trade union for home-based workers

3️⃣ Tansy Hoskins, a journalist who investigates the global fashion industry, and author of The Anti-Capitalist Book of Fashion

🔥 You can’t get “crazy low” prices without worker exploitation 🔥

Because billions in profits somehow isn’t enough, Amazon is now competing with Shein to make fashion even cheaper, faster and exploitative with its US beta discount store. The Shein/Temu model is bad enough on its own - now it’s being turbocharged by Amazon, a brand that:

1️⃣ Never paid the Hulu Garment workers in Cambodia in 2020

2️⃣ Refuses to sign a safety agreement that protects garment workers in Bangladesh & Pakistan

3️⃣ Has a highly documented history of union busting

‼️ Take action: tell Amazon to #PayYourWorkers using our quick email template: https://lnkd.in/dWKi3Xj

“There has never been a more important moment to make our actions count” - Tansy Hoskins ✊💕

A huge thank you to everyone who came along to our Women’s History Month panel earlier this week. Women are at the forefront of this resistance - we heard from four remarkable women in our network who are fighting for garment workers’ rights:

📣 Mirjana Obradović, a former garment worker who recounted her struggle to secure unpaid severance from a German brand and urged consumers to support garment workers’ demands

📣 Zehra Khan, a political activist who shared her incredible journey of founding Pakistan’s first trade union for home-based workers, lobbying for the Sindh Home-based Workers Act and bringing the Accord to Pakistan

📣 CCC’s very own Niki Gamara who explained the life-changing work the Urgent Appeals team do supporting garment workers to report and demand remediation for a factory floor violation, and seek solidarity from the global network

📣 Tansy Hoskins, an investigative journalist and author who made a passionate plea to see ourselves as so much more as consumers, find our place in the movement and donate to the Clean Clothes Campaign

While their stories differed, our panellists were united in their conviction that collective action is the best route to justice. ▶️ Watch the recording here: https://lnkd.in/e-DfGMVS

We’re beyond grateful for your support 💚
