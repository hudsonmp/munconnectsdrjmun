In a world that claims to prioritise gender equality, older women have been left on the sidelines. A glaring failure of the international community

HelpAge International’s report, Investing in Equality – Addressing the Funding Gap for Older Women, exposes an alarming finding: only 0.1 per cent of aid focused on gender equality specifically includes older women. Investing in Equality











Of the US$ 5.7 billion of aid spent on gender equality projects, a mere US$ 7.8 million includes older women. Older women: a growing, overlooked population 
By 2050, women over 50 will make up 34.7 per cent of the world’s female population (currently they represent 27 per cent). The shocking funding gap 
HelpAge’s analysis reveals an alarming truth: of the 7,231 projects reported by OECD-DAC members in 2021 to promote gender equality, only 16—just 0.2%—explicitly included older women. Investing in Equality

Women over the age of 50 account for 27 per cent of the world’s women and yet they are almost entirely invisible within debates on gender equality. To donors and international agencies: using their positions in global, regional and national fora to support and amplify older women’s voices in global development efforts and strengthen global efforts with regards to older women  
To multilateral agencies: supporting with the tools and coordination needed to drive and track action. With older women making up a growing share of the global population, donors must recognise that gender equality cannot be achieved without them. Global aid’s gender equality failures

HelpAge International’s goal is to improve the lives of older women and men in low- and middle-income countries, especially those in crisis-prone and insecure areas. Our strategy, outlined in Strategy 2030, positions us as a global convenor, supporter, and thought leader for a network of partner organisations committed to promoting the dignity, wellbeing, and voice of older people worldwide. Some of the key areas of work that we focus on are:  

Responding to humanitarian crises: We respond to emergencies and crises around the world by providing essential aid and support to older people affected by conflict, disasters, and displacement. Protecting the rights of older people: We advocate for the rights of older people and work to raise awareness about issues affecting them, such as age discrimination, elder abuse, and neglect.

Trends in Maternal Mortality: 2000 to 2023 is a new report from the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG), comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank Group, and UNDESA/Population Division. In 2023, an estimated 260,000 maternal deaths occurred worldwide, equivalent to 712 deaths each day. This marks a 40% reduction in maternal mortality since 2000, reflecting sustained global efforts to improve access to essential health services. In 2023, 37 countries were classified as being in conflict or experiencing institutional or social fragility, yet they accounted for 64% of global maternal deaths. Related topics

Respond to humanitarian crises - HelpAge International,https://www.helpage.org/what-we-do/humanitarian-action/,other,0.42142857142857143,,"A large and rapidly growing number of older people are affected by humanitarian crises. Older people face numerous barriers that see them excluded from humanitarian response, including:

Food distribution points can be difficult for older people to reach and food aid packages do not cater for older people’s particular nutritional requirements.

Building a fairer, healthier world









On World Health Day, 7 April 2021, we will be inviting you to join a new campaign to build a fairer, healthier world. We’ll be posting more details here shortly, but here’s why we’re doing this:Our world is an unequal one.As COVID-19 has highlighted, some people are able to live healthier lives and have better access to health services than others - entirely due to the conditions in which they are born, grow, live, work and age.All over the world, some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income, have poorer housing conditions and education, fewer employment opportunities, experience greater gender inequality, and have little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services. At the same time we urge leaders to monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.

About The ICPD
In 1994 the landmark International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo, transformed global thinking on population and development issues and defined a bold agenda, placing people’s dignity and rights at the heart of sustainable development. While there is progressive activism for social justice, climate action and equality, we are at a critical inflection point to preserve the hard-won gains and deliver on the vision of the ICPD agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – the historic set of goals adopted by world leaders in 2015 to eliminate poverty, achieve gender equality and secure the health and well-being of all people.
