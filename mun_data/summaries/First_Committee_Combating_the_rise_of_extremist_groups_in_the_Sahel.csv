      Support Vital for Myanmar’s Quake Victims, Despite Military Obstacles 
    

The massive earthquake in Myanmar has taken a terrible toll. In this Q&A, Crisis Group expert Richard Horsey discusses the urgent need for international assistance, the challenges facing aid delivery against a backdrop of civil war and the importance of a humanitarian pause in fighting. A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on 28 March, causing widespread devastation and killing at least 2,700 people – a toll that is likely to rise sharply in the coming days as information from affected areas trickles in. In Bangkok, 1,000km from the epicentre, the shock waves brought down a 30-storey building under construction; in a cruel irony, many of the workers who died as a result are thought to be migrants from Myanmar.The full extent of damage is not yet clear, but the destruction visited on Mandalay city and surrounding areas is plain to see, including in footage of multi-storey buildings collapsing in seconds. Since the earthquake, many people in the impact zone have been sleeping on the streets or other open areas, either because they lost their homes or because they are afraid to return to them given structural damage or the risk of aftershocks. While a comprehensive damage assessment has yet to be conducted, it is already clear that reconstruction costs will run into the tens of billions of dollars, with no plausible way to raise such sums given the regime’s difficulties in gaining access to foreign credit.The picture outside the major urban centres is even harder to piece together. Rural parts of Sagaing region, which have been scarred by the conflict raging across Myanmar since the coup, are mostly under the control of armed resistance groups, not the regime. They will be among the most challenging for aid agencies to reach, given regime restrictions, a complex configuration of local administrations and control by armed resistance groups, and the persistent conflict. The regime quickly declared a state of emergency in six states and regions and issued a rare plea for international aid, with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing saying in a national address just hours after the earthquake: “I would like to invite any country or organisation to come and assist”. The UN also mobilised its limited in-country resources to conduct damage and needs assessments and begin delivery of vital assistance while it ramps up a larger response.But as the focus shifts from conducting search-and-rescue operations to assisting the survivors – with clean water, sanitation, food, shelter and medical care – aid agencies are confronting daunting logistical, financial and political challenges.Major damage to road, rail and airport infrastructure caused by the earthquake means that simply reaching some of the affected areas is difficult. So, too, does the fact that Myanmar was already facing a major humanitarian crisis due to the coup and subsequent armed conflict, which has displaced more than three million people and crippled the economy. Will they try to direct aid to their core constituents and away from their adversaries?These are important concerns, not just because the junta has been blocking aid to areas under the control of other forces during post-coup fighting, but also because it has a track record of doing the same in previous natural disasters, particularly after Cyclone Mocha struck conflict-riven Rakhine State in 2023, killing hundreds and destroying some 200,000 houses and other buildings, including many in rebel-controlled areas. When Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar in 2008, killing an estimated 140,000 people, the military regime in power at the time spent three weeks downplaying the seriousness of the crisis and stonewalling the international response. Nevertheless, the regime’s initial denials and restrictions, and a huge number of unsubstantiated allegations by outside activists claiming that the military was stealing or diverting aid, gave many donors pause. The day after the disaster, the National Unity Government (NUG) – a parallel administration appointed by elected lawmakers ousted in the 2021 coup, which operates mostly from exile – announced that the armed units it controls will implement a “two-week pause in offensive military operations” in affected areas. The far more powerful ethnic armed groups still fighting the military – including the Arakan Army, Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Kachin Independence Organisation and Karen National Union – have not announced a halt to hostilities.While the fighting is not affecting the worst-hit area of urban Mandalay and its environs, the fact that neither the regime nor any of its most powerful opponents has even hinted at a humanitarian pause sends a signal that, apart from the NUG, no conflict party is willing to give priority to the relief operation. Although aid organisations may find more indirect ways to help people in areas not controlled by the regime, such as working through local community groups already in place, access across the battlelines would nevertheless help them reach all those affected by this disaster. As a deeply superstitious person himself, he is aware that many in his inner circle – and in much of the country – may interpret the disaster as a kind of karmic retribution for the coup and the violence his regime has subsequently unleashed on the people of Myanmar. Pre-existing internet and mobile phone shutdowns in some of the affected conflict areas should also be lifted.The regime has a huge credibility problem, domestically and internationally, and proactive steps such as these are vital for giving respite to the long-suffering population and for convincing donors and aid agencies that an international aid operation will be feasible.

In Bangkok, 1,000km from the epicentre, the shock waves brought down a 30-storey building under construction; in a cruel irony, many of the workers who died as a result are thought to be migrants from Myanmar.The full extent of damage is not yet clear, but the destruction visited on Mandalay city and surrounding areas is plain to see, including in footage of multi-storey buildings collapsing in seconds. Since the earthquake, many people in the impact zone have been sleeping on the streets or other open areas, either because they lost their homes or because they are afraid to return to them given structural damage or the risk of aftershocks. While a comprehensive damage assessment has yet to be conducted, it is already clear that reconstruction costs will run into the tens of billions of dollars, with no plausible way to raise such sums given the regime’s difficulties in gaining access to foreign credit.The picture outside the major urban centres is even harder to piece together. Rural parts of Sagaing region, which have been scarred by the conflict raging across Myanmar since the coup, are mostly under the control of armed resistance groups, not the regime. They will be among the most challenging for aid agencies to reach, given regime restrictions, a complex configuration of local administrations and control by armed resistance groups, and the persistent conflict. The regime quickly declared a state of emergency in six states and regions and issued a rare plea for international aid, with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing saying in a national address just hours after the earthquake: “I would like to invite any country or organisation to come and assist”. The UN also mobilised its limited in-country resources to conduct damage and needs assessments and begin delivery of vital assistance while it ramps up a larger response.But as the focus shifts from conducting search-and-rescue operations to assisting the survivors – with clean water, sanitation, food, shelter and medical care – aid agencies are confronting daunting logistical, financial and political challenges.Major damage to road, rail and airport infrastructure caused by the earthquake means that simply reaching some of the affected areas is difficult. So, too, does the fact that Myanmar was already facing a major humanitarian crisis due to the coup and subsequent armed conflict, which has displaced more than three million people and crippled the economy. Will they try to direct aid to their core constituents and away from their adversaries?These are important concerns, not just because the junta has been blocking aid to areas under the control of other forces during post-coup fighting, but also because it has a track record of doing the same in previous natural disasters, particularly after Cyclone Mocha struck conflict-riven Rakhine State in 2023, killing hundreds and destroying some 200,000 houses and other buildings, including many in rebel-controlled areas. When Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar in 2008, killing an estimated 140,000 people, the military regime in power at the time spent three weeks downplaying the seriousness of the crisis and stonewalling the international response. Nevertheless, the regime’s initial denials and restrictions, and a huge number of unsubstantiated allegations by outside activists claiming that the military was stealing or diverting aid, gave many donors pause. The far more powerful ethnic armed groups still fighting the military – including the Arakan Army, Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Kachin Independence Organisation and Karen National Union – have not announced a halt to hostilities.While the fighting is not affecting the worst-hit area of urban Mandalay and its environs, the fact that neither the regime nor any of its most powerful opponents has even hinted at a humanitarian pause sends a signal that, apart from the NUG, no conflict party is willing to give priority to the relief operation. Although aid organisations may find more indirect ways to help people in areas not controlled by the regime, such as working through local community groups already in place, access across the battlelines would nevertheless help them reach all those affected by this disaster. As a deeply superstitious person himself, he is aware that many in his inner circle – and in much of the country – may interpret the disaster as a kind of karmic retribution for the coup and the violence his regime has subsequently unleashed on the people of Myanmar. Pre-existing internet and mobile phone shutdowns in some of the affected conflict areas should also be lifted.The regime has a huge credibility problem, domestically and internationally, and proactive steps such as these are vital for giving respite to the long-suffering population and for convincing donors and aid agencies that an international aid operation will be feasible.

      A Glimmer of Peace in Syria’s North East
    

An accord between the interim government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces could mark a turn for the better in the country’s post-Assad transition. On 10 March, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led armed group that controls Syria’s north east, and the country’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, signed a landmark deal outlining the basis for integrating the SDF’s civilian and military apparatus into the central state. The SDF and its Autonomous Administration exercise de facto governance throughout most of Syria’s north east, home to oil and gas fields that produce 80-90 per cent of Syria’s hydrocarbon output. Seeking to bring about a new working relationship between the interim government and the SDF, it establishes follow-up committees through which the two sides have said they will flesh out a detailed roadmap by year’s end and aim to avert any fresh military confrontation between them. So, when al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, head of the SDF, signed the joint document in Damascus, signalling their commitment to unifying the country through dialogue rather than force of arms, the news was greeted with celebrations in the streets of many Syrian cities, including the capital and Qamishli in the north east. For many Syrians, the Damascus-SDF agreement offers a glimmer of hope that a more peaceful, inclusive transition can be achieved – and with it an improvement in relations with Washington, which continues to impose crippling sanctions.For the SDF, meanwhile, the agreement allays the risk of further incursions into the north east by Turkish-backed factions formerly known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) – a threat that has loomed large since some of those factions seized Manbij, a city just west of the Euphrates River, from the SDF just after Assad fell. has been urging the SDF to offer more in negotiations with Damascus – a message that the group has taken to heart, leading it to make overtures to the government weeks before the 10 March deal. Finally, it commits the two sides to “integrating all civil and military institutions in north-eastern Syria within the administration of the Syrian state, including border crossings, airports, and oil and gas fields”. The group also believed that Damascus, distracted by the tumult of Syria’s transition, could not give proper attention to negotiations about the north east.In light of these previous differences, the 10 March agreement is an ambitious step forward. Rather than ironing out those points right away, the two sides agreed to bridge the remaining gaps within a year via a series of joint negotiating committees, as first proposed by the SDF. The SDF’s approach to negotiations is rooted in the belief that time is on its side, while it also harbours doubts as to al-Sharaa’s ability to exert central rule over Syria. It favours a cautious, step-by-step approach to integration, starting with the central government resuming the limited role previously adopted by the Assad regime in the north east, including deploying small forces in parts of the cities of Qamishli and al-Hassakah, managing the Qamishli airport, and paying salaries to civil servants. Damascus, on the other hand, is intent on restoring central state authority over Arab areas held by the SDF, particularly those containing large oil and gas fields, and regards the re-establishment of the status quo ante under Assad in the north east as unacceptable. Another source of concern related to the truce stems from the difficulties that the interim government and the SDF leadership face in exercising control of forces operating on their respective sides of the front. On the other side, Kurdish insurgents, often operating outside the SDF’s aegis, have launched occasional attacks on SNA and Turkish targets, as part of the conflict between the PKK and Türkiye, which appears to be entering a new phase (see below). Soon after the uprising against Assad began in 2011, north-eastern Syria emerged as a stronghold of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the SDF’s armed wing and its backbone. Now, however, Ankara and the PKK may be on the doorstep of a fragile political process, which could deeply affect north-eastern Syria.Contacts between Türkiye and Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned PKK leader, led to a watershed declaration on 27 February, when Öcalan called on the PKK to disarm and dissolve. No date has been set, but should the group formally heed its leader’s injunction, the PKK and Ankara could enter a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, dampening tensions over Syria’s north east and creating more leeway for negotiations. Ankara’s primary concern in north-eastern Syria is that the PKK could tap its hydrocarbon resources, recruit fighters from the region or use it as a launchpad for attacks on Türkiye. Instead, Ankara, like Damascus, would like to see the SDF’s civil and military structures folded into those of the Syrian central government.Ankara appears to have four broad requirements. If the PKK indeed votes to dissolve, then presumably these militants would stand down anyway, making their exit from the SDF easier (in that case, Ankara might offer assurances to the SDF that its attacks will stop and accept the group’s presence in Kurdish-majority areas). Meanwhile, Iraq has speeded up repatriation of Iraqi citizens from al-Hol, a detention camp for families of ISIS fighters run by the SDF, to a rehabilitation facility in Iraq’s Ninewa province.The Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party, a close ally of Ankara, has supported both the Turkish initiative with the PKK and the talks between the SDF and Damascus. Signs are, however, that the Trump administration is actively considering a withdrawal in the coming year, and Pentagon officials are developing options for carrying out such an order.In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to back the SDF, encouraging the group to deal with Damascus directly. Central Command is also using its influence with the SDF to push for a negotiated outcome, even transporting Abdi (and other SDF leaders) to Damascus for the talks with al-Sharaa. That reticence, coupled with the complexities of the transition between administrations in Washington, which has seen numerous posts relevant to Syria at the National Security Council and the State Department left unfilled, has dampened engagement with the new authorities in Damascus. As such, Türkiye has initiated efforts to form a coalition with Syria, Iraq and Jordan to combat the remnants of ISIS, with officials from these nations meeting on 9 March in Amman, Jordan’s capital, to discuss joint strategies for fighting the group.

Another source of concern related to the truce stems from the difficulties that the interim government and the SDF leadership face in exercising control of forces operating on their respective sides of the front. On the other side, Kurdish insurgents, often operating outside the SDF’s aegis, have launched occasional attacks on SNA and Turkish targets, as part of the conflict between the PKK and Türkiye, which appears to be entering a new phase (see below). Soon after the uprising against Assad began in 2011, north-eastern Syria emerged as a stronghold of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the SDF’s armed wing and its backbone. Now, however, Ankara and the PKK may be on the doorstep of a fragile political process, which could deeply affect north-eastern Syria.Contacts between Türkiye and Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned PKK leader, led to a watershed declaration on 27 February, when Öcalan called on the PKK to disarm and dissolve. No date has been set, but should the group formally heed its leader’s injunction, the PKK and Ankara could enter a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, dampening tensions over Syria’s north east and creating more leeway for negotiations. Ankara’s primary concern in north-eastern Syria is that the PKK could tap its hydrocarbon resources, recruit fighters from the region or use it as a launchpad for attacks on Türkiye. Instead, Ankara, like Damascus, would like to see the SDF’s civil and military structures folded into those of the Syrian central government.Ankara appears to have four broad requirements. If the PKK indeed votes to dissolve, then presumably these militants would stand down anyway, making their exit from the SDF easier (in that case, Ankara might offer assurances to the SDF that its attacks will stop and accept the group’s presence in Kurdish-majority areas). Meanwhile, Iraq has speeded up repatriation of Iraqi citizens from al-Hol, a detention camp for families of ISIS fighters run by the SDF, to a rehabilitation facility in Iraq’s Ninewa province.The Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party, a close ally of Ankara, has supported both the Turkish initiative with the PKK and the talks between the SDF and Damascus. Signs are, however, that the Trump administration is actively considering a withdrawal in the coming year, and Pentagon officials are developing options for carrying out such an order.In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to back the SDF, encouraging the group to deal with Damascus directly. Central Command is also using its influence with the SDF to push for a negotiated outcome, even transporting Abdi (and other SDF leaders) to Damascus for the talks with al-Sharaa. That reticence, coupled with the complexities of the transition between administrations in Washington, which has seen numerous posts relevant to Syria at the National Security Council and the State Department left unfilled, has dampened engagement with the new authorities in Damascus. As such, Türkiye has initiated efforts to form a coalition with Syria, Iraq and Jordan to combat the remnants of ISIS, with officials from these nations meeting on 9 March in Amman, Jordan’s capital, to discuss joint strategies for fighting the group.

      A Glimmer of Peace in Syria’s North East
    

An accord between the interim government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces could mark a turn for the better in the country’s post-Assad transition. On 10 March, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led armed group that controls Syria’s north east, and the country’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, signed a landmark deal outlining the basis for integrating the SDF’s civilian and military apparatus into the central state. The SDF and its Autonomous Administration exercise de facto governance throughout most of Syria’s north east, home to oil and gas fields that produce 80-90 per cent of Syria’s hydrocarbon output. Seeking to bring about a new working relationship between the interim government and the SDF, it establishes follow-up committees through which the two sides have said they will flesh out a detailed roadmap by year’s end and aim to avert any fresh military confrontation between them. So, when al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, head of the SDF, signed the joint document in Damascus, signalling their commitment to unifying the country through dialogue rather than force of arms, the news was greeted with celebrations in the streets of many Syrian cities, including the capital and Qamishli in the north east. For many Syrians, the Damascus-SDF agreement offers a glimmer of hope that a more peaceful, inclusive transition can be achieved – and with it an improvement in relations with Washington, which continues to impose crippling sanctions.For the SDF, meanwhile, the agreement allays the risk of further incursions into the north east by Turkish-backed factions formerly known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) – a threat that has loomed large since some of those factions seized Manbij, a city just west of the Euphrates River, from the SDF just after Assad fell. has been urging the SDF to offer more in negotiations with Damascus – a message that the group has taken to heart, leading it to make overtures to the government weeks before the 10 March deal. Finally, it commits the two sides to “integrating all civil and military institutions in north-eastern Syria within the administration of the Syrian state, including border crossings, airports, and oil and gas fields”. The group also believed that Damascus, distracted by the tumult of Syria’s transition, could not give proper attention to negotiations about the north east.In light of these previous differences, the 10 March agreement is an ambitious step forward. Rather than ironing out those points right away, the two sides agreed to bridge the remaining gaps within a year via a series of joint negotiating committees, as first proposed by the SDF. The SDF’s approach to negotiations is rooted in the belief that time is on its side, while it also harbours doubts as to al-Sharaa’s ability to exert central rule over Syria. It favours a cautious, step-by-step approach to integration, starting with the central government resuming the limited role previously adopted by the Assad regime in the north east, including deploying small forces in parts of the cities of Qamishli and al-Hassakah, managing the Qamishli airport, and paying salaries to civil servants.

The SDF’s approach to negotiations is rooted in the belief that time is on its side, while it also harbours doubts as to al-Sharaa’s ability to exert central rule over Syria. It favours a cautious, step-by-step approach to integration, starting with the central government resuming the limited role previously adopted by the Assad regime in the north east, including deploying small forces in parts of the cities of Qamishli and al-Hassakah, managing the Qamishli airport, and paying salaries to civil servants. Damascus, on the other hand, is intent on restoring central state authority over Arab areas held by the SDF, particularly those containing large oil and gas fields, and regards the re-establishment of the status quo ante under Assad in the north east as unacceptable. Another source of concern related to the truce stems from the difficulties that the interim government and the SDF leadership face in exercising control of forces operating on their respective sides of the front. On the other side, Kurdish insurgents, often operating outside the SDF’s aegis, have launched occasional attacks on SNA and Turkish targets, as part of the conflict between the PKK and Türkiye, which appears to be entering a new phase (see below). Soon after the uprising against Assad began in 2011, north-eastern Syria emerged as a stronghold of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the SDF’s armed wing and its backbone. Now, however, Ankara and the PKK may be on the doorstep of a fragile political process, which could deeply affect north-eastern Syria.Contacts between Türkiye and Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned PKK leader, led to a watershed declaration on 27 February, when Öcalan called on the PKK to disarm and dissolve. No date has been set, but should the group formally heed its leader’s injunction, the PKK and Ankara could enter a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, dampening tensions over Syria’s north east and creating more leeway for negotiations. Ankara’s primary concern in north-eastern Syria is that the PKK could tap its hydrocarbon resources, recruit fighters from the region or use it as a launchpad for attacks on Türkiye. Instead, Ankara, like Damascus, would like to see the SDF’s civil and military structures folded into those of the Syrian central government.Ankara appears to have four broad requirements. If the PKK indeed votes to dissolve, then presumably these militants would stand down anyway, making their exit from the SDF easier (in that case, Ankara might offer assurances to the SDF that its attacks will stop and accept the group’s presence in Kurdish-majority areas). Meanwhile, Iraq has speeded up repatriation of Iraqi citizens from al-Hol, a detention camp for families of ISIS fighters run by the SDF, to a rehabilitation facility in Iraq’s Ninewa province.The Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party, a close ally of Ankara, has supported both the Turkish initiative with the PKK and the talks between the SDF and Damascus. Signs are, however, that the Trump administration is actively considering a withdrawal in the coming year, and Pentagon officials are developing options for carrying out such an order.In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to back the SDF, encouraging the group to deal with Damascus directly. Central Command is also using its influence with the SDF to push for a negotiated outcome, even transporting Abdi (and other SDF leaders) to Damascus for the talks with al-Sharaa. That reticence, coupled with the complexities of the transition between administrations in Washington, which has seen numerous posts relevant to Syria at the National Security Council and the State Department left unfilled, has dampened engagement with the new authorities in Damascus. As such, Türkiye has initiated efforts to form a coalition with Syria, Iraq and Jordan to combat the remnants of ISIS, with officials from these nations meeting on 9 March in Amman, Jordan’s capital, to discuss joint strategies for fighting the group.

An accord between the interim government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces could mark a turn for the better in the country’s post-Assad transition. On 10 March, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led armed group that controls Syria’s north east, and the country’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, signed a landmark deal outlining the basis for integrating the SDF’s civilian and military apparatus into the central state. The SDF and its Autonomous Administration exercise de facto governance throughout most of Syria’s north east, home to oil and gas fields that produce 80-90 per cent of Syria’s hydrocarbon output. Seeking to bring about a new working relationship between the interim government and the SDF, it establishes follow-up committees through which the two sides have said they will flesh out a detailed roadmap by year’s end and aim to avert any fresh military confrontation between them. So, when al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, head of the SDF, signed the joint document in Damascus, signalling their commitment to unifying the country through dialogue rather than force of arms, the news was greeted with celebrations in the streets of many Syrian cities, including the capital and Qamishli in the north east. For many Syrians, the Damascus-SDF agreement offers a glimmer of hope that a more peaceful, inclusive transition can be achieved – and with it an improvement in relations with Washington, which continues to impose crippling sanctions.For the SDF, meanwhile, the agreement allays the risk of further incursions into the north east by Turkish-backed factions formerly known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) – a threat that has loomed large since some of those factions seized Manbij, a city just west of the Euphrates River, from the SDF just after Assad fell. has been urging the SDF to offer more in negotiations with Damascus – a message that the group has taken to heart, leading it to make overtures to the government weeks before the 10 March deal. Finally, it commits the two sides to “integrating all civil and military institutions in north-eastern Syria within the administration of the Syrian state, including border crossings, airports, and oil and gas fields”. The group also believed that Damascus, distracted by the tumult of Syria’s transition, could not give proper attention to negotiations about the north east.In light of these previous differences, the 10 March agreement is an ambitious step forward.

      Support Vital for Myanmar’s Quake Victims, Despite Military Obstacles 
    

The massive earthquake in Myanmar has taken a terrible toll. In this Q&A, Crisis Group expert Richard Horsey discusses the urgent need for international assistance, the challenges facing aid delivery against a backdrop of civil war and the importance of a humanitarian pause in fighting. A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on 28 March, causing widespread devastation and killing at least 2,700 people – a toll that is likely to rise sharply in the coming days as information from affected areas trickles in. In Bangkok, 1,000km from the epicentre, the shock waves brought down a 30-storey building under construction; in a cruel irony, many of the workers who died as a result are thought to be migrants from Myanmar.The full extent of damage is not yet clear, but the destruction visited on Mandalay city and surrounding areas is plain to see, including in footage of multi-storey buildings collapsing in seconds. Since the earthquake, many people in the impact zone have been sleeping on the streets or other open areas, either because they lost their homes or because they are afraid to return to them given structural damage or the risk of aftershocks. While a comprehensive damage assessment has yet to be conducted, it is already clear that reconstruction costs will run into the tens of billions of dollars, with no plausible way to raise such sums given the regime’s difficulties in gaining access to foreign credit.The picture outside the major urban centres is even harder to piece together. Rural parts of Sagaing region, which have been scarred by the conflict raging across Myanmar since the coup, are mostly under the control of armed resistance groups, not the regime. They will be among the most challenging for aid agencies to reach, given regime restrictions, a complex configuration of local administrations and control by armed resistance groups, and the persistent conflict. The regime quickly declared a state of emergency in six states and regions and issued a rare plea for international aid, with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing saying in a national address just hours after the earthquake: “I would like to invite any country or organisation to come and assist”. The UN also mobilised its limited in-country resources to conduct damage and needs assessments and begin delivery of vital assistance while it ramps up a larger response.But as the focus shifts from conducting search-and-rescue operations to assisting the survivors – with clean water, sanitation, food, shelter and medical care – aid agencies are confronting daunting logistical, financial and political challenges.Major damage to road, rail and airport infrastructure caused by the earthquake means that simply reaching some of the affected areas is difficult. So, too, does the fact that Myanmar was already facing a major humanitarian crisis due to the coup and subsequent armed conflict, which has displaced more than three million people and crippled the economy. Will they try to direct aid to their core constituents and away from their adversaries?These are important concerns, not just because the junta has been blocking aid to areas under the control of other forces during post-coup fighting, but also because it has a track record of doing the same in previous natural disasters, particularly after Cyclone Mocha struck conflict-riven Rakhine State in 2023, killing hundreds and destroying some 200,000 houses and other buildings, including many in rebel-controlled areas. When Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar in 2008, killing an estimated 140,000 people, the military regime in power at the time spent three weeks downplaying the seriousness of the crisis and stonewalling the international response. Nevertheless, the regime’s initial denials and restrictions, and a huge number of unsubstantiated allegations by outside activists claiming that the military was stealing or diverting aid, gave many donors pause. The day after the disaster, the National Unity Government (NUG) – a parallel administration appointed by elected lawmakers ousted in the 2021 coup, which operates mostly from exile – announced that the armed units it controls will implement a “two-week pause in offensive military operations” in affected areas. The far more powerful ethnic armed groups still fighting the military – including the Arakan Army, Ta’ang National Liberation Army, Kachin Independence Organisation and Karen National Union – have not announced a halt to hostilities.While the fighting is not affecting the worst-hit area of urban Mandalay and its environs, the fact that neither the regime nor any of its most powerful opponents has even hinted at a humanitarian pause sends a signal that, apart from the NUG, no conflict party is willing to give priority to the relief operation. Although aid organisations may find more indirect ways to help people in areas not controlled by the regime, such as working through local community groups already in place, access across the battlelines would nevertheless help them reach all those affected by this disaster. As a deeply superstitious person himself, he is aware that many in his inner circle – and in much of the country – may interpret the disaster as a kind of karmic retribution for the coup and the violence his regime has subsequently unleashed on the people of Myanmar. Pre-existing internet and mobile phone shutdowns in some of the affected conflict areas should also be lifted.The regime has a huge credibility problem, domestically and internationally, and proactive steps such as these are vital for giving respite to the long-suffering population and for convincing donors and aid agencies that an international aid operation will be feasible.

      Support Vital for Myanmar’s Quake Victims, Despite Military Obstacles 
    

The massive earthquake in Myanmar has taken a terrible toll. A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on 28 March, causing widespread devastation and killing at least 2,700 people – a toll that is likely to rise sharply in the coming days as information from affected areas trickles in. In Bangkok, 1,000km from the epicentre, the shock waves brought down a 30-storey building under construction; in a cruel irony, many of the workers who died as a result are thought to be migrants from Myanmar.The full extent of damage is not yet clear, but the destruction visited on Mandalay city and surrounding areas is plain to see, including in footage of multi-storey buildings collapsing in seconds. Since the earthquake, many people in the impact zone have been sleeping on the streets or other open areas, either because they lost their homes or because they are afraid to return to them given structural damage or the risk of aftershocks. While a comprehensive damage assessment has yet to be conducted, it is already clear that reconstruction costs will run into the tens of billions of dollars, with no plausible way to raise such sums given the regime’s difficulties in gaining access to foreign credit.The picture outside the major urban centres is even harder to piece together. Rural parts of Sagaing region, which have been scarred by the conflict raging across Myanmar since the coup, are mostly under the control of armed resistance groups, not the regime. They will be among the most challenging for aid agencies to reach, given regime restrictions, a complex configuration of local administrations and control by armed resistance groups, and the persistent conflict. The regime quickly declared a state of emergency in six states and regions and issued a rare plea for international aid, with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing saying in a national address just hours after the earthquake: “I would like to invite any country or organisation to come and assist”. The UN also mobilised its limited in-country resources to conduct damage and needs assessments and begin delivery of vital assistance while it ramps up a larger response.But as the focus shifts from conducting search-and-rescue operations to assisting the survivors – with clean water, sanitation, food, shelter and medical care – aid agencies are confronting daunting logistical, financial and political challenges.Major damage to road, rail and airport infrastructure caused by the earthquake means that simply reaching some of the affected areas is difficult. So, too, does the fact that Myanmar was already facing a major humanitarian crisis due to the coup and subsequent armed conflict, which has displaced more than three million people and crippled the economy. Will they try to direct aid to their core constituents and away from their adversaries?These are important concerns, not just because the junta has been blocking aid to areas under the control of other forces during post-coup fighting, but also because it has a track record of doing the same in previous natural disasters, particularly after Cyclone Mocha struck conflict-riven Rakhine State in 2023, killing hundreds and destroying some 200,000 houses and other buildings, including many in rebel-controlled areas. When Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar in 2008, killing an estimated 140,000 people, the military regime in power at the time spent three weeks downplaying the seriousness of the crisis and stonewalling the international response. Nevertheless, the regime’s initial denials and restrictions, and a huge number of unsubstantiated allegations by outside activists claiming that the military was stealing or diverting aid, gave many donors pause.

      A Glimmer of Peace in Syria’s North East
    

An accord between the interim government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces could mark a turn for the better in the country’s post-Assad transition. On 10 March, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led armed group that controls Syria’s north east, and the country’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, signed a landmark deal outlining the basis for integrating the SDF’s civilian and military apparatus into the central state. The SDF and its Autonomous Administration exercise de facto governance throughout most of Syria’s north east, home to oil and gas fields that produce 80-90 per cent of Syria’s hydrocarbon output. Seeking to bring about a new working relationship between the interim government and the SDF, it establishes follow-up committees through which the two sides have said they will flesh out a detailed roadmap by year’s end and aim to avert any fresh military confrontation between them. So, when al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, head of the SDF, signed the joint document in Damascus, signalling their commitment to unifying the country through dialogue rather than force of arms, the news was greeted with celebrations in the streets of many Syrian cities, including the capital and Qamishli in the north east. For many Syrians, the Damascus-SDF agreement offers a glimmer of hope that a more peaceful, inclusive transition can be achieved – and with it an improvement in relations with Washington, which continues to impose crippling sanctions.For the SDF, meanwhile, the agreement allays the risk of further incursions into the north east by Turkish-backed factions formerly known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) – a threat that has loomed large since some of those factions seized Manbij, a city just west of the Euphrates River, from the SDF just after Assad fell. has been urging the SDF to offer more in negotiations with Damascus – a message that the group has taken to heart, leading it to make overtures to the government weeks before the 10 March deal. Finally, it commits the two sides to “integrating all civil and military institutions in north-eastern Syria within the administration of the Syrian state, including border crossings, airports, and oil and gas fields”. The group also believed that Damascus, distracted by the tumult of Syria’s transition, could not give proper attention to negotiations about the north east.In light of these previous differences, the 10 March agreement is an ambitious step forward. Rather than ironing out those points right away, the two sides agreed to bridge the remaining gaps within a year via a series of joint negotiating committees, as first proposed by the SDF. The SDF’s approach to negotiations is rooted in the belief that time is on its side, while it also harbours doubts as to al-Sharaa’s ability to exert central rule over Syria. It favours a cautious, step-by-step approach to integration, starting with the central government resuming the limited role previously adopted by the Assad regime in the north east, including deploying small forces in parts of the cities of Qamishli and al-Hassakah, managing the Qamishli airport, and paying salaries to civil servants. Damascus, on the other hand, is intent on restoring central state authority over Arab areas held by the SDF, particularly those containing large oil and gas fields, and regards the re-establishment of the status quo ante under Assad in the north east as unacceptable. Another source of concern related to the truce stems from the difficulties that the interim government and the SDF leadership face in exercising control of forces operating on their respective sides of the front. On the other side, Kurdish insurgents, often operating outside the SDF’s aegis, have launched occasional attacks on SNA and Turkish targets, as part of the conflict between the PKK and Türkiye, which appears to be entering a new phase (see below). Soon after the uprising against Assad began in 2011, north-eastern Syria emerged as a stronghold of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the SDF’s armed wing and its backbone. Now, however, Ankara and the PKK may be on the doorstep of a fragile political process, which could deeply affect north-eastern Syria.Contacts between Türkiye and Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned PKK leader, led to a watershed declaration on 27 February, when Öcalan called on the PKK to disarm and dissolve. No date has been set, but should the group formally heed its leader’s injunction, the PKK and Ankara could enter a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, dampening tensions over Syria’s north east and creating more leeway for negotiations. Ankara’s primary concern in north-eastern Syria is that the PKK could tap its hydrocarbon resources, recruit fighters from the region or use it as a launchpad for attacks on Türkiye. Instead, Ankara, like Damascus, would like to see the SDF’s civil and military structures folded into those of the Syrian central government.Ankara appears to have four broad requirements. If the PKK indeed votes to dissolve, then presumably these militants would stand down anyway, making their exit from the SDF easier (in that case, Ankara might offer assurances to the SDF that its attacks will stop and accept the group’s presence in Kurdish-majority areas). Meanwhile, Iraq has speeded up repatriation of Iraqi citizens from al-Hol, a detention camp for families of ISIS fighters run by the SDF, to a rehabilitation facility in Iraq’s Ninewa province.The Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party, a close ally of Ankara, has supported both the Turkish initiative with the PKK and the talks between the SDF and Damascus. Signs are, however, that the Trump administration is actively considering a withdrawal in the coming year, and Pentagon officials are developing options for carrying out such an order.In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to back the SDF, encouraging the group to deal with Damascus directly. Central Command is also using its influence with the SDF to push for a negotiated outcome, even transporting Abdi (and other SDF leaders) to Damascus for the talks with al-Sharaa. That reticence, coupled with the complexities of the transition between administrations in Washington, which has seen numerous posts relevant to Syria at the National Security Council and the State Department left unfilled, has dampened engagement with the new authorities in Damascus. As such, Türkiye has initiated efforts to form a coalition with Syria, Iraq and Jordan to combat the remnants of ISIS, with officials from these nations meeting on 9 March in Amman, Jordan’s capital, to discuss joint strategies for fighting the group.

The group also believed that Damascus, distracted by the tumult of Syria’s transition, could not give proper attention to negotiations about the north east.In light of these previous differences, the 10 March agreement is an ambitious step forward. Rather than ironing out those points right away, the two sides agreed to bridge the remaining gaps within a year via a series of joint negotiating committees, as first proposed by the SDF. The SDF’s approach to negotiations is rooted in the belief that time is on its side, while it also harbours doubts as to al-Sharaa’s ability to exert central rule over Syria. It favours a cautious, step-by-step approach to integration, starting with the central government resuming the limited role previously adopted by the Assad regime in the north east, including deploying small forces in parts of the cities of Qamishli and al-Hassakah, managing the Qamishli airport, and paying salaries to civil servants. Damascus, on the other hand, is intent on restoring central state authority over Arab areas held by the SDF, particularly those containing large oil and gas fields, and regards the re-establishment of the status quo ante under Assad in the north east as unacceptable. Another source of concern related to the truce stems from the difficulties that the interim government and the SDF leadership face in exercising control of forces operating on their respective sides of the front. On the other side, Kurdish insurgents, often operating outside the SDF’s aegis, have launched occasional attacks on SNA and Turkish targets, as part of the conflict between the PKK and Türkiye, which appears to be entering a new phase (see below). Soon after the uprising against Assad began in 2011, north-eastern Syria emerged as a stronghold of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the SDF’s armed wing and its backbone. Now, however, Ankara and the PKK may be on the doorstep of a fragile political process, which could deeply affect north-eastern Syria.Contacts between Türkiye and Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned PKK leader, led to a watershed declaration on 27 February, when Öcalan called on the PKK to disarm and dissolve. No date has been set, but should the group formally heed its leader’s injunction, the PKK and Ankara could enter a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, dampening tensions over Syria’s north east and creating more leeway for negotiations. Ankara’s primary concern in north-eastern Syria is that the PKK could tap its hydrocarbon resources, recruit fighters from the region or use it as a launchpad for attacks on Türkiye. Instead, Ankara, like Damascus, would like to see the SDF’s civil and military structures folded into those of the Syrian central government.Ankara appears to have four broad requirements. If the PKK indeed votes to dissolve, then presumably these militants would stand down anyway, making their exit from the SDF easier (in that case, Ankara might offer assurances to the SDF that its attacks will stop and accept the group’s presence in Kurdish-majority areas). Meanwhile, Iraq has speeded up repatriation of Iraqi citizens from al-Hol, a detention camp for families of ISIS fighters run by the SDF, to a rehabilitation facility in Iraq’s Ninewa province.The Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party, a close ally of Ankara, has supported both the Turkish initiative with the PKK and the talks between the SDF and Damascus. Signs are, however, that the Trump administration is actively considering a withdrawal in the coming year, and Pentagon officials are developing options for carrying out such an order.In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to back the SDF, encouraging the group to deal with Damascus directly. Central Command is also using its influence with the SDF to push for a negotiated outcome, even transporting Abdi (and other SDF leaders) to Damascus for the talks with al-Sharaa. That reticence, coupled with the complexities of the transition between administrations in Washington, which has seen numerous posts relevant to Syria at the National Security Council and the State Department left unfilled, has dampened engagement with the new authorities in Damascus. As such, Türkiye has initiated efforts to form a coalition with Syria, Iraq and Jordan to combat the remnants of ISIS, with officials from these nations meeting on 9 March in Amman, Jordan’s capital, to discuss joint strategies for fighting the group.

      A Glimmer of Peace in Syria’s North East
    

An accord between the interim government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces could mark a turn for the better in the country’s post-Assad transition. On 10 March, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led armed group that controls Syria’s north east, and the country’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, signed a landmark deal outlining the basis for integrating the SDF’s civilian and military apparatus into the central state. The SDF and its Autonomous Administration exercise de facto governance throughout most of Syria’s north east, home to oil and gas fields that produce 80-90 per cent of Syria’s hydrocarbon output. Seeking to bring about a new working relationship between the interim government and the SDF, it establishes follow-up committees through which the two sides have said they will flesh out a detailed roadmap by year’s end and aim to avert any fresh military confrontation between them. So, when al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, head of the SDF, signed the joint document in Damascus, signalling their commitment to unifying the country through dialogue rather than force of arms, the news was greeted with celebrations in the streets of many Syrian cities, including the capital and Qamishli in the north east. For many Syrians, the Damascus-SDF agreement offers a glimmer of hope that a more peaceful, inclusive transition can be achieved – and with it an improvement in relations with Washington, which continues to impose crippling sanctions.For the SDF, meanwhile, the agreement allays the risk of further incursions into the north east by Turkish-backed factions formerly known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) – a threat that has loomed large since some of those factions seized Manbij, a city just west of the Euphrates River, from the SDF just after Assad fell. has been urging the SDF to offer more in negotiations with Damascus – a message that the group has taken to heart, leading it to make overtures to the government weeks before the 10 March deal.

An accord between the interim government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces could mark a turn for the better in the country’s post-Assad transition. On 10 March, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led armed group that controls Syria’s north east, and the country’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, signed a landmark deal outlining the basis for integrating the SDF’s civilian and military apparatus into the central state. The SDF and its Autonomous Administration exercise de facto governance throughout most of Syria’s north east, home to oil and gas fields that produce 80-90 per cent of Syria’s hydrocarbon output. Seeking to bring about a new working relationship between the interim government and the SDF, it establishes follow-up committees through which the two sides have said they will flesh out a detailed roadmap by year’s end and aim to avert any fresh military confrontation between them. So, when al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, head of the SDF, signed the joint document in Damascus, signalling their commitment to unifying the country through dialogue rather than force of arms, the news was greeted with celebrations in the streets of many Syrian cities, including the capital and Qamishli in the north east. For many Syrians, the Damascus-SDF agreement offers a glimmer of hope that a more peaceful, inclusive transition can be achieved – and with it an improvement in relations with Washington, which continues to impose crippling sanctions.For the SDF, meanwhile, the agreement allays the risk of further incursions into the north east by Turkish-backed factions formerly known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) – a threat that has loomed large since some of those factions seized Manbij, a city just west of the Euphrates River, from the SDF just after Assad fell. has been urging the SDF to offer more in negotiations with Damascus – a message that the group has taken to heart, leading it to make overtures to the government weeks before the 10 March deal. Finally, it commits the two sides to “integrating all civil and military institutions in north-eastern Syria within the administration of the Syrian state, including border crossings, airports, and oil and gas fields”. The group also believed that Damascus, distracted by the tumult of Syria’s transition, could not give proper attention to negotiations about the north east.In light of these previous differences, the 10 March agreement is an ambitious step forward. Rather than ironing out those points right away, the two sides agreed to bridge the remaining gaps within a year via a series of joint negotiating committees, as first proposed by the SDF. The SDF’s approach to negotiations is rooted in the belief that time is on its side, while it also harbours doubts as to al-Sharaa’s ability to exert central rule over Syria. It favours a cautious, step-by-step approach to integration, starting with the central government resuming the limited role previously adopted by the Assad regime in the north east, including deploying small forces in parts of the cities of Qamishli and al-Hassakah, managing the Qamishli airport, and paying salaries to civil servants. Damascus, on the other hand, is intent on restoring central state authority over Arab areas held by the SDF, particularly those containing large oil and gas fields, and regards the re-establishment of the status quo ante under Assad in the north east as unacceptable. Another source of concern related to the truce stems from the difficulties that the interim government and the SDF leadership face in exercising control of forces operating on their respective sides of the front. On the other side, Kurdish insurgents, often operating outside the SDF’s aegis, have launched occasional attacks on SNA and Turkish targets, as part of the conflict between the PKK and Türkiye, which appears to be entering a new phase (see below). Soon after the uprising against Assad began in 2011, north-eastern Syria emerged as a stronghold of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the SDF’s armed wing and its backbone. Now, however, Ankara and the PKK may be on the doorstep of a fragile political process, which could deeply affect north-eastern Syria.Contacts between Türkiye and Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned PKK leader, led to a watershed declaration on 27 February, when Öcalan called on the PKK to disarm and dissolve. No date has been set, but should the group formally heed its leader’s injunction, the PKK and Ankara could enter a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, dampening tensions over Syria’s north east and creating more leeway for negotiations. Ankara’s primary concern in north-eastern Syria is that the PKK could tap its hydrocarbon resources, recruit fighters from the region or use it as a launchpad for attacks on Türkiye. Instead, Ankara, like Damascus, would like to see the SDF’s civil and military structures folded into those of the Syrian central government.Ankara appears to have four broad requirements. If the PKK indeed votes to dissolve, then presumably these militants would stand down anyway, making their exit from the SDF easier (in that case, Ankara might offer assurances to the SDF that its attacks will stop and accept the group’s presence in Kurdish-majority areas). Meanwhile, Iraq has speeded up repatriation of Iraqi citizens from al-Hol, a detention camp for families of ISIS fighters run by the SDF, to a rehabilitation facility in Iraq’s Ninewa province.The Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party, a close ally of Ankara, has supported both the Turkish initiative with the PKK and the talks between the SDF and Damascus. Signs are, however, that the Trump administration is actively considering a withdrawal in the coming year, and Pentagon officials are developing options for carrying out such an order.In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to back the SDF, encouraging the group to deal with Damascus directly. Central Command is also using its influence with the SDF to push for a negotiated outcome, even transporting Abdi (and other SDF leaders) to Damascus for the talks with al-Sharaa. That reticence, coupled with the complexities of the transition between administrations in Washington, which has seen numerous posts relevant to Syria at the National Security Council and the State Department left unfilled, has dampened engagement with the new authorities in Damascus. As such, Türkiye has initiated efforts to form a coalition with Syria, Iraq and Jordan to combat the remnants of ISIS, with officials from these nations meeting on 9 March in Amman, Jordan’s capital, to discuss joint strategies for fighting the group.
