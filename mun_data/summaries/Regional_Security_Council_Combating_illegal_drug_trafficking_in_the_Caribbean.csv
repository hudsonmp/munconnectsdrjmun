YOUTH CRIME PREVENTION THROUGH SPORT











Publications



Multimedia



Events & News



Where we work








Effective crime prevention should not be the exclusive responsibility of law enforcement and criminal justice systems. The contribution of sport in empowering and engaging young people is also acknowledged by Member States, for example in the Kyoto Declaration as well as in a number of General Assembly resolutions that request action to integrate sport into youth crime prevention and criminal justice strategies and use it for addressing risk factors and protective factors associated with youth violence and crime. Global initiative on Youth Crime Prevention through Sport
The way that sport programmes are designed and delivered is crucial in achieving positive results and crime prevention objectives. Against this backdrop, UNODC, within its mandate area of crime prevention, facilitates the implementation of effective and evidence-based initiatives that explore the added value of sport as a vehicle to increase young people’s resilience to violence, crime and drug use. With this goal in mind, the Office engages in the development of guidance tools, the provision of technical assistance and capacity building activities, awareness raising campaigns, policy events, youth and sport festivals, youth consultations and workshops, grants schemes for civil society organizations, and the creation of safe and accessible sport facilities through refurbishment and provision of sport equipment.

SC:ORE
SC:ORE seeks to support the effective use of sport in the context of youth violence and crime prevention, enhance the role of sport and of the sport sector in this regard, promote multisectoral approaches and partnerships, including between the sport and criminal justice sectors, and build knowledge on evidence-based programming in this area. Read more




 Policy Guide
The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime and the International Olympic Committee, in the context of the joint programme on “Sport against Crime: Outreach – Resilience – Empowerment” (SC:ORE), have developed comprehensive guidance (2024)  to advance the use of sport for the prevention of youth violence and in building safe, just and peaceful communities.
