Determined to “build a motor car for the great multitude,” pioneering American car maker Henry Ford implements the first moving automotive assembly line for his Model T, soon trimming its production time from 12.5 hours to 93 minutes. Patterson & Sons of Greenfield, Ohio becomes history’s first and only African American-owned car company, joining hundreds of scrappy start-ups as horse-drawn vehicles give way to combustion-engine automobiles. But other automakers quickly adopt many of its innovations, including all-steel bodies.1934: The Citroen Traction Avant: From Gangsters to the GestapoThe Traction Avant, the brainchild of French engineer and industrialist Andre-Gustave Citroën, is credited as the world’s first mass-produced, front-wheel-drive car.

Also known as the Second World War, it was caused in part by the economic crisis of the Great Depression and by political tensions left unresolved following the end of World War I. The war began when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and raged across the globe until 1945, when Japan surrendered to the United States after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By the end of World War II, an estimated 60 to 80 million people had died, including up to 55 million civilians, and numerous cities in Europe and Asia were reduced to rubble. The legacy of the war included the creation of the United Nations as a peacekeeping force and geopolitical rivalries that resulted in the Cold War.Leading up to World War IIThe devastation of the Great War (as World War I was known at the time) had greatly destabilized Europe, and in many respects World War II grew out of issues left unresolved by that earlier conflict. In particular, political and economic instability in Germany, and lingering resentment over the harsh terms imposed by the Versailles Treaty, fueled the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and National Socialist German Workers’ Party, abbreviated as NSDAP in German and the Nazi Party in English..Did you know?As early as 1923, in his memoir and propaganda tract ""Mein Kampf"" (My Struggle), Adolf Hitler had predicted a general European war that would result in ""the extermination of the Jewish race in Germany.""After becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Hitler swiftly consolidated power, anointing himself Führer (supreme leader) in 1934. Hitler’s open aggression went unchecked, as the United States and Soviet Union were concentrated on internal politics at the time, and neither France nor Britain (the two other nations most devastated by the Great War) were eager for confrontation.Outbreak of World War II (1939)In late August 1939, Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, which incited a frenzy of worry in London and Paris. On September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland from the west; two days later, France and Britain declared war on Germany, beginning World War II.On September 17, Soviet troops invaded Poland from the east. During the six months following the invasion of Poland, the lack of action on the part of Germany and the Allies in the west led to talk in the news media of a “phony war.” At sea, however, the British and German navies faced off in heated battle, and lethal German U-boat submarines struck at merchant shipping bound for Britain, sinking more than 100 vessels in the first four months of World War II.World War II in the West (1940-41)Lend-Lease ActThe Lend-Lease Act was a compromise that allowed the United States to provide aid to England while avoiding full involvement in World War II.On April 9, 1940, Germany simultaneously invaded Norway and occupied Denmark, and the war began in earnest. Three days later, Hitler’s troops crossed the Meuse River and struck French forces at Sedan, located at the northern end of the Maginot Line, an elaborate chain of fortifications constructed after World War I and considered an impenetrable defensive barrier. With France on the verge of collapse, Italy’s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini formed an alliance with Hitler, the Pact of Steel, and Italy declared war against France and Britain on June 10.On June 14, German forces entered Paris; a new government formed by Marshal Philippe Petain (France’s hero of World War I) requested an armistice two nights later. Arguments between Hitler and his commanders delayed the next German advance until October, when it was stalled by a Soviet counteroffensive and the onset of harsh winter weather.World War II in the Pacific (1941-43)The Path to Pearl HarborHow did things get so bad between the US and Japan in the lead up to WWII? The attack on Pearl Harbor served to unify American public opinion in favor of entering World War II, and on December 8 Congress declared war on Japan with only one dissenting vote. This “island-hopping” strategy proved successful, and Allied forces moved closer to their ultimate goal of invading the mainland Japan.Toward Allied Victory in World War II (1943-45)Battle of StalingradIn July 1942, the Nazi Army bombs the Soviet city of Stalingrad, launching one of the bloodiest battles in history.In North Africa, British and American forces had defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943. An Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy followed, and Mussolini’s government fell in July 1943, though Allied fighting against the Germans in Italy would continue until 1945.On the Eastern Front, a Soviet counteroffensive launched in November 1942 ended the bloody Battle of Stalingrad, which had seen some of the fiercest combat of World War II. Soviet troops soon advanced into Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, while Hitler gathered his forces to drive the Americans and British back from Germany in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945), the last major German offensive of the war.An intensive aerial bombardment in February 1945 preceded the Allied land invasion of Germany, and by the time Germany formally surrendered on May 8, Soviet forces had occupied much of the country. On the divisive matter of Eastern Europe’s future, Churchill and Truman acquiesced to Stalin, as they needed Soviet cooperation in the war against Japan.Heavy casualties sustained in the campaigns at Iwo Jima (February 1945) and Okinawa (April-June 1945), and fears of the even costlier land invasion of Japan led Truman to authorize the use of a new and devastating weapon. General Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan’s formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.African American Servicemen Fight Two WarsA tank and crew from the 761st Tank Battalion in front of the Prince Albert Memorial in Coburg, Germany, 1945.The National ArchivesA tank and crew from the 761st Tank Battalion in front of the Prince Albert Memorial in Coburg, Germany, 1945.The National ArchivesWorld War II exposed a glaring paradox within the United States Armed Forces. Black servicemen rarely saw combat and were largely relegated to labor and supply units that were commanded by white officers.There were several African American units that proved essential in helping to win World War II, with the Tuskegee Airmen being among the most celebrated. military in 1948.World War II Casualties and LegacyWorld War II proved to be the deadliest international conflict in history, taking the lives of 60 to 80 million people, including 6 million Jews who died at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust.

Also known as the Second World War, it was caused in part by the economic crisis of the Great Depression and by political tensions left unresolved following the end of World War I. The war began when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and raged across the globe until 1945, when Japan surrendered to the United States after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By the end of World War II, an estimated 60 to 80 million people had died, including up to 55 million civilians, and numerous cities in Europe and Asia were reduced to rubble. The legacy of the war included the creation of the United Nations as a peacekeeping force and geopolitical rivalries that resulted in the Cold War.Leading up to World War IIThe devastation of the Great War (as World War I was known at the time) had greatly destabilized Europe, and in many respects World War II grew out of issues left unresolved by that earlier conflict. In particular, political and economic instability in Germany, and lingering resentment over the harsh terms imposed by the Versailles Treaty, fueled the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and National Socialist German Workers’ Party, abbreviated as NSDAP in German and the Nazi Party in English..Did you know?As early as 1923, in his memoir and propaganda tract ""Mein Kampf"" (My Struggle), Adolf Hitler had predicted a general European war that would result in ""the extermination of the Jewish race in Germany.""After becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Hitler swiftly consolidated power, anointing himself Führer (supreme leader) in 1934. Hitler’s open aggression went unchecked, as the United States and Soviet Union were concentrated on internal politics at the time, and neither France nor Britain (the two other nations most devastated by the Great War) were eager for confrontation.Outbreak of World War II (1939)In late August 1939, Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, which incited a frenzy of worry in London and Paris. On September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland from the west; two days later, France and Britain declared war on Germany, beginning World War II.On September 17, Soviet troops invaded Poland from the east. During the six months following the invasion of Poland, the lack of action on the part of Germany and the Allies in the west led to talk in the news media of a “phony war.” At sea, however, the British and German navies faced off in heated battle, and lethal German U-boat submarines struck at merchant shipping bound for Britain, sinking more than 100 vessels in the first four months of World War II.World War II in the West (1940-41)Lend-Lease ActThe Lend-Lease Act was a compromise that allowed the United States to provide aid to England while avoiding full involvement in World War II.On April 9, 1940, Germany simultaneously invaded Norway and occupied Denmark, and the war began in earnest. Three days later, Hitler’s troops crossed the Meuse River and struck French forces at Sedan, located at the northern end of the Maginot Line, an elaborate chain of fortifications constructed after World War I and considered an impenetrable defensive barrier. With France on the verge of collapse, Italy’s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini formed an alliance with Hitler, the Pact of Steel, and Italy declared war against France and Britain on June 10.On June 14, German forces entered Paris; a new government formed by Marshal Philippe Petain (France’s hero of World War I) requested an armistice two nights later. Arguments between Hitler and his commanders delayed the next German advance until October, when it was stalled by a Soviet counteroffensive and the onset of harsh winter weather.World War II in the Pacific (1941-43)The Path to Pearl HarborHow did things get so bad between the US and Japan in the lead up to WWII? The attack on Pearl Harbor served to unify American public opinion in favor of entering World War II, and on December 8 Congress declared war on Japan with only one dissenting vote. This “island-hopping” strategy proved successful, and Allied forces moved closer to their ultimate goal of invading the mainland Japan.Toward Allied Victory in World War II (1943-45)Battle of StalingradIn July 1942, the Nazi Army bombs the Soviet city of Stalingrad, launching one of the bloodiest battles in history.In North Africa, British and American forces had defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943. An Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy followed, and Mussolini’s government fell in July 1943, though Allied fighting against the Germans in Italy would continue until 1945.On the Eastern Front, a Soviet counteroffensive launched in November 1942 ended the bloody Battle of Stalingrad, which had seen some of the fiercest combat of World War II. Soviet troops soon advanced into Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, while Hitler gathered his forces to drive the Americans and British back from Germany in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945), the last major German offensive of the war.An intensive aerial bombardment in February 1945 preceded the Allied land invasion of Germany, and by the time Germany formally surrendered on May 8, Soviet forces had occupied much of the country. On the divisive matter of Eastern Europe’s future, Churchill and Truman acquiesced to Stalin, as they needed Soviet cooperation in the war against Japan.Heavy casualties sustained in the campaigns at Iwo Jima (February 1945) and Okinawa (April-June 1945), and fears of the even costlier land invasion of Japan led Truman to authorize the use of a new and devastating weapon. General Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan’s formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.African American Servicemen Fight Two WarsA tank and crew from the 761st Tank Battalion in front of the Prince Albert Memorial in Coburg, Germany, 1945.The National ArchivesA tank and crew from the 761st Tank Battalion in front of the Prince Albert Memorial in Coburg, Germany, 1945.The National ArchivesWorld War II exposed a glaring paradox within the United States Armed Forces. Black servicemen rarely saw combat and were largely relegated to labor and supply units that were commanded by white officers.There were several African American units that proved essential in helping to win World War II, with the Tuskegee Airmen being among the most celebrated. military in 1948.World War II Casualties and LegacyWorld War II proved to be the deadliest international conflict in history, taking the lives of 60 to 80 million people, including 6 million Jews who died at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust. Civilians made up an estimated 50-55 million deaths from the war, while military comprised 21 to 25 million of those lost during the war. Millions more were injured, and still more lost their homes and property.The legacy of the war would include the spread of communism from the Soviet Union into eastern Europe as well as its eventual triumph in China, and the global shift in power from Europe to two rival superpowers–the United States and the Soviet Union–that would soon face off against each other in the Cold War.Photo GalleriesOn December 7, 1941 the Japanese military launched a surprise attack on the U.S. ships in the harbor, while other planes strafed the decks with bullets and dropped bombs.The National ArchiveA sailor stands among wrecked airplanes at Ford Island Naval Air Station as he watches the explosion of the USS Shaw.MPI/Getty ImagesSmoke rises from the burning buildings on Ford Island, Pearl Harbor.Epics/Getty ImagesA sailor runs for cover past flaming wreckage hit by dive bombers that had already blasted Pearl Harbor and Hickam Field at the Kaneohe Bay Naval Station.Time Life Pictures/National Archives/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty ImagesSmoke pouring from sinking battleship USS California (center); capsized bulk of USS Oklahoma visible (at right).Time Life Pictures/US Navy/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty ImagesThe USS Arizona explodes after a Japanese attack.The National ArchiveBlasted into a pile of junk by the Japanese in the sneak raid of December 7, the battleship USS Arizona lies in the mud at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

The war began when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and raged across the globe until 1945, when Japan surrendered to the United States after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By the end of World War II, an estimated 60 to 80 million people had died, including up to 55 million civilians, and numerous cities in Europe and Asia were reduced to rubble. World War II, the largest and deadliest conflict in human history, involved more than 50 nations and was fought on land, sea and air in nearly every part of the world. Also known as the Second World War, it was caused in part by the economic crisis of the Great Depression and by political tensions left unresolved following the end of World War I.

Leading up to World War IIThe devastation of the Great War (as World War I was known at the time) had greatly destabilized Europe, and in many respects World War II grew out of issues left unresolved by that earlier conflict. In particular, political and economic instability in Germany, and lingering resentment over the harsh terms imposed by the Versailles Treaty, fueled the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and National Socialist German Workers’ Party, abbreviated as NSDAP in German and the Nazi Party in English..Did you know?As early as 1923, in his memoir and propaganda tract ""Mein Kampf"" (My Struggle), Adolf Hitler had predicted a general European war that would result in ""the extermination of the Jewish race in Germany.""After becoming Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Hitler swiftly consolidated power, anointing himself Führer (supreme leader) in 1934. Hitler’s open aggression went unchecked, as the United States and Soviet Union were concentrated on internal politics at the time, and neither France nor Britain (the two other nations most devastated by the Great War) were eager for confrontation.Outbreak of World War II (1939)In late August 1939, Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, which incited a frenzy of worry in London and Paris. On September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland from the west; two days later, France and Britain declared war on Germany, beginning World War II.On September 17, Soviet troops invaded Poland from the east. During the six months following the invasion of Poland, the lack of action on the part of Germany and the Allies in the west led to talk in the news media of a “phony war.” At sea, however, the British and German navies faced off in heated battle, and lethal German U-boat submarines struck at merchant shipping bound for Britain, sinking more than 100 vessels in the first four months of World War II.World War II in the West (1940-41)Lend-Lease ActThe Lend-Lease Act was a compromise that allowed the United States to provide aid to England while avoiding full involvement in World War II.On April 9, 1940, Germany simultaneously invaded Norway and occupied Denmark, and the war began in earnest. Three days later, Hitler’s troops crossed the Meuse River and struck French forces at Sedan, located at the northern end of the Maginot Line, an elaborate chain of fortifications constructed after World War I and considered an impenetrable defensive barrier. With France on the verge of collapse, Italy’s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini formed an alliance with Hitler, the Pact of Steel, and Italy declared war against France and Britain on June 10.On June 14, German forces entered Paris; a new government formed by Marshal Philippe Petain (France’s hero of World War I) requested an armistice two nights later. Arguments between Hitler and his commanders delayed the next German advance until October, when it was stalled by a Soviet counteroffensive and the onset of harsh winter weather.World War II in the Pacific (1941-43)The Path to Pearl HarborHow did things get so bad between the US and Japan in the lead up to WWII? The attack on Pearl Harbor served to unify American public opinion in favor of entering World War II, and on December 8 Congress declared war on Japan with only one dissenting vote. This “island-hopping” strategy proved successful, and Allied forces moved closer to their ultimate goal of invading the mainland Japan.Toward Allied Victory in World War II (1943-45)Battle of StalingradIn July 1942, the Nazi Army bombs the Soviet city of Stalingrad, launching one of the bloodiest battles in history.In North Africa, British and American forces had defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943. An Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy followed, and Mussolini’s government fell in July 1943, though Allied fighting against the Germans in Italy would continue until 1945.On the Eastern Front, a Soviet counteroffensive launched in November 1942 ended the bloody Battle of Stalingrad, which had seen some of the fiercest combat of World War II. Soviet troops soon advanced into Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, while Hitler gathered his forces to drive the Americans and British back from Germany in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945), the last major German offensive of the war.An intensive aerial bombardment in February 1945 preceded the Allied land invasion of Germany, and by the time Germany formally surrendered on May 8, Soviet forces had occupied much of the country. On the divisive matter of Eastern Europe’s future, Churchill and Truman acquiesced to Stalin, as they needed Soviet cooperation in the war against Japan.Heavy casualties sustained in the campaigns at Iwo Jima (February 1945) and Okinawa (April-June 1945), and fears of the even costlier land invasion of Japan led Truman to authorize the use of a new and devastating weapon. General Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan’s formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.African American Servicemen Fight Two WarsA tank and crew from the 761st Tank Battalion in front of the Prince Albert Memorial in Coburg, Germany, 1945.The National ArchivesA tank and crew from the 761st Tank Battalion in front of the Prince Albert Memorial in Coburg, Germany, 1945.The National ArchivesWorld War II exposed a glaring paradox within the United States Armed Forces. Black servicemen rarely saw combat and were largely relegated to labor and supply units that were commanded by white officers.There were several African American units that proved essential in helping to win World War II, with the Tuskegee Airmen being among the most celebrated. military in 1948.World War II Casualties and LegacyWorld War II proved to be the deadliest international conflict in history, taking the lives of 60 to 80 million people, including 6 million Jews who died at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust. Civilians made up an estimated 50-55 million deaths from the war, while military comprised 21 to 25 million of those lost during the war. Millions more were injured, and still more lost their homes and property.The legacy of the war would include the spread of communism from the Soviet Union into eastern Europe as well as its eventual triumph in China, and the global shift in power from Europe to two rival superpowers–the United States and the Soviet Union–that would soon face off against each other in the Cold War.Photo GalleriesOn December 7, 1941 the Japanese military launched a surprise attack on the U.S. ships in the harbor, while other planes strafed the decks with bullets and dropped bombs.The National ArchiveA sailor stands among wrecked airplanes at Ford Island Naval Air Station as he watches the explosion of the USS Shaw.MPI/Getty ImagesSmoke rises from the burning buildings on Ford Island, Pearl Harbor.Epics/Getty ImagesA sailor runs for cover past flaming wreckage hit by dive bombers that had already blasted Pearl Harbor and Hickam Field at the Kaneohe Bay Naval Station.Time Life Pictures/National Archives/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty ImagesSmoke pouring from sinking battleship USS California (center); capsized bulk of USS Oklahoma visible (at right).Time Life Pictures/US Navy/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty ImagesThe USS Arizona explodes after a Japanese attack.The National ArchiveBlasted into a pile of junk by the Japanese in the sneak raid of December 7, the battleship USS Arizona lies in the mud at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

Soviet troops soon advanced into Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, while Hitler gathered his forces to drive the Americans and British back from Germany in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945), the last major German offensive of the war.An intensive aerial bombardment in February 1945 preceded the Allied land invasion of Germany, and by the time Germany formally surrendered on May 8, Soviet forces had occupied much of the country.

Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, the United States was entering the fourth year of the Great Depression, the worst economic downturn in the nation’s history.The stock market had fallen a staggering 75 percent from 1929 levels, and one in every four workers was unemployed.

In reality, his words had been carefully written, revised and fact-checked by a team of advisers, but Roosevelt had a way of making them feel informal and fresh.The effect was powerful: On March 13, when healthy banks reopened, people lined up in droves to return their cash.

“Let us unite in banishing fear,” he concluded. “Together we cannot fail.”

Roosevelt wasn’t the first president to use the medium of radio, but he was the first to use it so effectively to speak directly to the American people, without the filter of the press.

When Cigarette Companies Used Doctors to Push SmokingBefore studies showed that cigarettes caused cancer, tobacco companies recruited the medical community for their ads. In January 1964, the FTC proposed warning labels saying smoking is dangerous to health, may cause cancer and that the Surgeon General found it “contributes substantially to mortality from certain diseases and to the overall death rate.”

The mortality rates and death references worried the cigarette companies, which responded with more lobbying and a public relations campaign highlighting the economic importance of the tobacco industry. Congress passed the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act in July 1965, requiring that all cigarette packs include the statement “Caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health”. Congress passed the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act in July 1965, requiring that all cigarette packs include the statement “Caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health”. “But at the same time, it showed that our political processes could really support population health by regulating very big and powerful industries.”

In a nod to the tobacco lobby, the law prevented federal, state and local government bodies from enacting any other cigarette labeling or advertising requirements for four years. While the tobacco industry succeeded in weakening the warning language, the sector saw the labels as beneficial, to some degree, because smokers were now informed their health could suffer because of cigarette use, potentially reducing the risk of lawsuits from smokers who developed health problems.

Two short years after 1968, the year the United States endured a series of cataclysmic episodes of politically tinged bloodletting, historian Richard Hofstadter observed that “Americans certainly have a reason to inquire whether…they are not a people of exceptional violence.”Indeed, as ’68 brought shockwave after shockwave—assassinations, urban riots and ugly news from the Vietnam War front—a fierce national debate buzzed: Was the United States a society far more prone to violence than all other industrialized nations? Martin Luther King, Jr., the civil-rights icon and Nobel Peace Laureate, told striking workers in Memphis, Tennessee on April 3, 1968 that “the nation is sick, trouble is in the land.” After a racist gunman shot and killed King the next day, The Los Angeles Times editorialized that “we are a sick society that has fallen far short of what we claim to be,” adding that a “kind of mental and moral decay is eating out the vitals of this country.” The New York Times pinpointed the sickness as coming from the stench of racial prejudice and racial hatred that remained powerful currents of thought and were at the root of the murder of the iconic civil rights leader. And while Johnson was among those who maintained that the country’s democracy was fundamentally healthy, most other American leaders and activists disagreed.They differed, though, over the ailment’s causes.VIDEO: The Assassination of RFK The assassination of Robert Kennedy was another tragic incident in a year marked with unrest.Depending who you asked, the culprit could be one or more of a laundry list of toxic forces. For some, it was a growing crisis of faith in a government that allowed so many citizens to languish in poverty—and that repeatedly lied to its people about lack of progress in the war effort.Indeed, for many on both the left and the right, there was a feeling that the “system”—the nation’s institutions, be they civic, political or religious—had become complicit in fomenting the violence (Vietnam). They are not racists or sick; they are not guilty of the crime that plagues the land.” Blaming the nation’s leaders for America’s convulsive state, Nixon offered himself as the solution: leadership that would crack down on lawlessness and counteract years of what he characterized as Democratic failure.Not that the nation’s past hadn’t been littered with politically driven bloodletting. “Whether one considers assassination, group violence or individual acts of violence, the decade of the 1960s was considerably more violent than the several decades preceding it and ranks among the most violent in our history.” And the violence of 1968 in particular clashed with Americans’ notions of what it meant to be a 20th-century superpower—especially one touting the ideological supremacy of democratic rights and freedoms amid the anxieties of the Cold War.Martin Luther King’s assassination, followed quickly by Bobby Kennedy’s, dashed much hope that social progress and economic justice could be achieved through nonviolent means. Their murders fueled the notion that King had been prophetic about the nation being “sick” and “troubled.”Firefighters battle a store fire set off during riots in Harlem, New York City, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. (Credit: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images)Firefighters battle a store fire set off during riots in Harlem, New York City, after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. He even announced the formation of a National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, which later concluded that the root cause of America’s sickness was a dearth of employment and educational opportunities in America’s “inner cities.” The Commission ultimately recommended that the United States overhaul its criminal justice system, adopt “a national firearms policy” to restrict access to handguns, provide more opportunities for youth to work in public service, and “improve the conditions of family and community life for all who live in our cities, and especially for the poor who are concentrated in ghetto slums.”The pattern didn’t end with RFK’s assassination. Just 23 years after the United States led a coalition to defeat the evil of Nazi fascism, Western democracy itself seemed engulfed in one violent outbreak after another.Why Did Columbia University Students Protest in 1968?Learn how the Vietnam War and the construction of a gym on campus prompted Columbia University student groups to protest the administration in 1968. Learn how the Vietnam War and the construction of a gym on campus prompted Columbia University student groups to protest the administration in 1968. By decade’s end, the group’s radical splinter faction, the Weather Underground, turned to bomb-making and more violent means of revolution.Yet it would be a mistake to dismiss 1968 as a year when the United States simply unraveled and lost all hope of civil discourse. And while the abuses of urban police departments remain rampant 50 years on, the Black Lives Matter movement, combined with increasing media scrutiny of police violence against African-Americans, serve as reminders that efforts to reform police practices and the criminal-justice system remain central to the political conversation.Yes, the violent, bloody shadow of 1968 still casts itself over the United States 50 years later. It survived that brutal, tumultuous year, and is still very much with us.Matthew Dallek is associate professor at George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management and author, most recently, of Defenseless Under the Night: The Roosevelt Years and the Origins of Homeland Security.History Reads features the work of prominent authors and historians.Related ArticlesSee All Articles 1960sWhen Cigarette Warning Labels Led to a Crackdown on SmokingThe 1965 U.S. 1960sWhy Were Vietnam War Vets Treated Poorly When They Returned?American soldiers returning home from Vietnam often faced scorn as the war they had fought in became increasingly unpopular.

But the bubble eventually had to burst. Scores of investors were ruined, and companies found it difficult to finance their operations.“The stock market crash did two things,” explains Mary Eschelbach Hansen, a professor of economics at American University. But the still-new institution’s policies in the 1920s not only failed to stop the Great Depression but actually may have helped to cause it.“There was a drastic 67 percent increase in the money supply between 1921 and 1929,” explains Daniel J. Smith, a professor of economics and finance and director of the Political Economy Research Institute at Middle Tennessee State University.That policy led to declining interest rates, which encouraged people to borrow and overinvest. This didn’t occur due to the easy monetary policies of the young Fed.”But eventually, in 1929, the Fed’s board worried that speculation was out of control, and abruptly slammed on the breaks by contracting the money supply and raising interest rates, Smith notes.The Fed’s move to cool the stock market worked a little too well.

4.The Gold StandardBack in 1929, the United States—like many other countries at the time—was on the Gold Standard, with the dollar redeemable in gold and pegged to its value. But after the Wall Street crash, nervous investors began to trade their dollars for gold.As former Fed chairman Ben Bernacke noted in a 2004 lecture, the Fed then moved to jack up interest rates higher to protect the dollar’s value.

Roosevelt tried to stimulate the economy with a range of incentives including Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, but ultimately it took the manufacturing production increases of World War II to end the Great Depression.What Caused the Great Depression?Throughout the 1920s, the U.S. The global adherence to the gold standard, which joined countries around the world in fixed currency exchange, helped spread economic woes from the United States throughout the world, especially in Europe.How Did the Gold Standard Contribute to the Great Depression?A number of complex factors helped to create the conditions necessary for the Great Depression—adherence to the gold standard was just one of those factors.By: Lindsey KonkelBank Runs and the Hoover AdministrationDespite assurances from President Herbert Hoover and other leaders that the crisis would run its course, matters continued to get worse over the next three years. The “Dust Bowl” inspired a mass migration of people from farmland to cities in search of work.In the fall of 1930, the first of four waves of banking panics began, as large numbers of investors lost confidence in the solvency of their banks and demanded deposits in cash, forcing banks to liquidate loans in order to supplement their insufficient cash reserves on hand.Bank runs swept the United States again in the spring and fall of 1931 and the fall of 1932, and by early 1933 thousands of banks had closed their doors.In the face of this dire situation, Hoover’s administration tried supporting failing banks and other institutions with government loans; the idea was that the banks in turn would loan to businesses, which would be able to hire back their employees.FDR and the Great DepressionFranklin D. He also began addressing the public directly over the radio in a series of talks, and these so-called “fireside chats” went a long way toward restoring public confidence.During Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office, his administration passed legislation that aimed to stabilize industrial and agricultural production, create jobs and stimulate recovery.In addition, Roosevelt sought to reform the financial system, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect depositors’ accounts and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the stock market and prevent abuses of the kind that led to the 1929 crash.The New Deal: A Road to RecoveryFranklin D. Roosevelt's New DealHow did President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal get the American economy back on track, and which components still have a major impact on today's society?Among the programs and institutions of the New Deal that aided in recovery from the Great Depression was the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which built dams and hydroelectric projects to control flooding and provide electric power to the impoverished Tennessee Valley region, and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a permanent jobs program that employed 8.5 million people from 1935 to 1943.When the Great Depression began, the United States was the only industrialized country in the world without some form of unemployment insurance or social security. The 22 percent decline in marriage rates between 1929 and 1939 also created an increase in single women in search of employment.Women during the Great Depression had a strong advocate in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who lobbied her husband for more women in office—like Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, the first woman to ever hold a cabinet position.Jobs available to women paid less but were more stable during the banking crisis: nursing, teaching and domestic work. But there was a catch: over 25 percent of the National Recovery Administration’s wage codes set lower wages for women, and jobs created under the WPA confined women to fields like sewing and nursing that paid less than roles reserved for men.Married women faced an additional hurdle: By 1940, 26 states had placed restrictions known as marriage bars on their employment, as working wives were perceived as taking away jobs from able-bodied men—even if, in practice, they were occupying jobs men would not want and doing them for far less pay.Great Depression Ends and World War II BeginsWith Roosevelt’s decision to support Britain and France in the struggle against Germany and the other Axis Powers, defense manufacturing geared up, producing more and more private-sector jobs.The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 led to America’s entry into World War II, and the nation’s factories went back into full production mode.This expanding industrial production, as well as widespread conscription beginning in 1942, reduced the unemployment rate to below its pre-Depression level. The Great Depression had ended at last, and the United States turned its attention to the global conflict of World War II.Photo GalleriesIn the mid-1930s, the Farm Security Administration’s Resettlement Administration hired photographers to document the work done by the agency. Lange took this photo in New Mexico in 1935, noting, “It was conditions of this sort which forced many farmers to abandon the area.”Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationArthur Rothstein was one of the first photographers to join the Farm Security Administration. His most noteworthy contribution during his five years with FSA may have been this photograph, showing a (supposedly posed) farmer walking in the face of a dust storm with his sons in Oklahoma, 1936.Arthur Rothstein/Farm Security AdministrationOklahoma dust bowl refugees reach San Fernando, California in their overloaded vehicle in this 1935 FSA photo by Lange.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationMigrants from Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Mexico pick carrots on a California farm in 1937.

The beginning of World War II would finally turn migrants’ fortunes as many headed to cities to work in factories as part of the war effort.Dorothea Lange/Farm Security AdministrationWalker Evans was among a handful of photographers hired by the Farm Security Administration to document the lives of farmers and the challenges of rural poverty from 1935–1944.

What Caused the Great Depression?Throughout the 1920s, the U.S. The global adherence to the gold standard, which joined countries around the world in fixed currency exchange, helped spread economic woes from the United States throughout the world, especially in Europe.How Did the Gold Standard Contribute to the Great Depression?A number of complex factors helped to create the conditions necessary for the Great Depression—adherence to the gold standard was just one of those factors.By: Lindsey KonkelBank Runs and the Hoover AdministrationDespite assurances from President Herbert Hoover and other leaders that the crisis would run its course, matters continued to get worse over the next three years. The “Dust Bowl” inspired a mass migration of people from farmland to cities in search of work.In the fall of 1930, the first of four waves of banking panics began, as large numbers of investors lost confidence in the solvency of their banks and demanded deposits in cash, forcing banks to liquidate loans in order to supplement their insufficient cash reserves on hand.Bank runs swept the United States again in the spring and fall of 1931 and the fall of 1932, and by early 1933 thousands of banks had closed their doors.In the face of this dire situation, Hoover’s administration tried supporting failing banks and other institutions with government loans; the idea was that the banks in turn would loan to businesses, which would be able to hire back their employees.FDR and the Great Depression
