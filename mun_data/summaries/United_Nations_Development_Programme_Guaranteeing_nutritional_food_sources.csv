For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience.1.2 Connect you with people and organizations you care about:We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the Meta Products you use.
