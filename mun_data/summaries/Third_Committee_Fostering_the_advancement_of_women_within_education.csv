Inside the crisis you don’t see: How war impacts women’s mental health | UN Women – Headquarters,https://www.unwomen.org/en/articles/explainer/inside-the-crisis-you-dont-see-how-war-impacts-womens-mental-health,other,0.42500000000000004,,"Today, over 600 million women and girls live in conflict-affected areas, a 50 per cent increase since 2017. Despite the alarming data, mental health receives just 1-2 per cent of global health financing, even though mental health and psychosocial conditions account for 20 per cent of health issues reported in emergencies. UN Women spoke to women working in Afghanistan, Gaza, Georgia and Ukraine to understand how crisis is impacting women’s mental health. Alison Davidian, UN Women Country Representative in Afghanistan, warns that almost four years of countless Taliban decrees are “eviscerating” the autonomy of women and girls. There are no women in leadership positions, and 98 per cent of women say they have limited or no influence over decisions in their communities. Sixty-eight per cent of women describe their mental health as “bad” or “very bad”, and eight per cent say they personally know someone who has attempted suicide, according to a recent UN Women report. UN Women data shows that 75 per cent of women feel regular depression, 62 per cent cannot sleep, and 65 per cent suffer from nightmares and anxiety. Of the women UN Women interviewed, 77 per cent were responsible for feeding and caring for children. Photo: UN Women/Suad Al Nawajha

In Ukraine, war has pushed women backwards on every front.

Women from marginalized groups, including Roma women, LGBTQI+ individuals, and women with disabilities, face added layers of trauma and even fewer options for support.

Ukraine’s women face soaring domestic violence and depression
In Ukraine, war has pushed women backwards on every front. Gender-based violence has surged 36 per cent since 2022, women are doing more unpaid care work—up to 56 hours per week just on childcare—and unemployment has soared.

I only breathed freely once we crossed.” 
Women from marginalized groups, including Roma women, LGBTQI+ individuals, and women with disabilities, face added layers of trauma and even fewer options for support.

About UN Women



Photo: UN Women/Bruno Demeocq





Work and priorities
UN Women is the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. UN Women supports UN Member States as they set global standards for achieving gender equality, and works with governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes and services needed to ensure that the standards are effectively implemented and truly benefit women and girls worldwide. It works globally to make the vision of the Sustainable Development Goals a reality for women and girls and stands behind women’s equal participation in all aspects of life, focusing on four strategic priorities:

Women lead, participate in and benefit equally from governance systems
Women have income security, decent work and economic autonomy
All women and girls live a life free from all forms of violence 
Women and girls contribute to and have greater influence in building sustainable peace and resilience, and benefit equally from the prevention of natural disasters and conflicts and humanitarian action

UN Women also coordinates and promotes the UN system’s work in advancing gender equality, and in all deliberations and agreements linked to the 2030 Agenda. Working for the empowerment and rights of women and girls globally, UN Women’s main roles are:

To support inter-governmental bodies, such as the Commission on the Status of Women, in their formulation of policies, global standards and norms. It merges and builds on the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN system, which focused exclusively on gender equality and women’s empowerment:

Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW)
International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW)
Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI)
United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)

One in four countries report backlash on women’s rights in 2024 | UN Women – Headquarters,https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/press-release/2025/03/one-in-four-countries-report-backlash-on-womens-rights-in-2024,other,0.45,,"Women’s and girls’ rights are facing unprecedented growing threats worldwide, from higher levels of discrimination to weaker legal protections, and less funding for programmes and institutions that support and protect women. UN Women’s latest report “Women's Rights in Review 30 Years After Beijing”, published ahead of the UN 50th International Women’s Day on 8 March, shows that in 2024 nearly a quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash on women’s rights. “UN Women is committed to ensuring that ALL Women and Girls, everywhere, can fully enjoy their rights and freedoms,” affirmed UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous. Women and girls are demanding change—and they deserve nothing less.”
2025 marks 30 years of progress since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most visionary roadmap on women’s rights. The “Women's Rights in Review 30 Years After Beijing” report, which draws on feedback provided by 159 Governments to the United Nations Secretary-General, shows progress that must be acknowledged - since 1995, parity has been achieved in girls’ education and maternal mortality has dropped by a third. That’s why today’s report also features the new Beijing+30 Action Agenda, a courageous roadmap to complete our unfinished business by focusing on:

A digital revolution for all women and girls: We must ensure equal access to technology, equip women and girls to lead in AI and digital innovation, and guarantee their online safety and privacy. In a pivotal year for women and girls, that is also a year of pushback and crises like no other, let us push women’s rights forward to create a world where all women and girls enjoy equal rights and equal opportunities.

Women and girls are demanding change—and they deserve nothing less.”

In a pivotal year for women and girls, that is also a year of pushback and crises like no other, let us push women’s rights forward to create a world where all women and girls enjoy equal rights and equal opportunities. “UN Women is committed to ensuring that ALL Women and Girls, everywhere, can fully enjoy their rights and freedoms,” affirmed UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous. Women and girls are demanding change—and they deserve nothing less.”

Girls' Education
Every day, girls face barriers to education caused by poverty, cultural norms and practices, poor infrastructure, violence and fragility. As the largest financing development partner in education globally, the World Bank ensures that all of its education projects are gender-sensitive, and works to overcome barriers that are preventing girls and boys from equally benefiting from countries’ investments in education.Girls’ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school; have the opportunity to complete all levels of education, acquiring the knowledge and skills to compete in the labor market; gain socio-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world; make decisions about their own lives; and contribute to their communities and the world.Both individuals and countries benefit from girls’ education. A 2018 World Bank study estimates that the “limited educational opportunities for girls, and barriers to completing 12 years of education, cost countries between US$15 trillion and $30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity and earnings.” All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and countries out of poverty.The ChallengeAccording to UNICEF  estimates, around the world, 122 million girls are out of school, including 34 million of primary school age, and 87 million of secondary school age. But while enrollment rates are similar – in fact, two-thirds of all countries have reached gender parity in primary school enrollment – completion rates for girls are lower in low-income countries where 63% of female primary school students complete primary school, compared to 67% of male primary school students. Studies consistently reinforce that girls who face multiple disadvantages — such as low family income, living in remote or underserved locations or who have a disability or belong to a minority ethno-linguistic group — are farthest behind in terms of access to and completion of education.Violence also prevents girls from accessing and completing education – often girls are forced to walk long distances to school placing them at an increased risk of violence and many experience violence while at school. Working through interventions in education, health, social protection, water, infrastructure, and other sectors, we are making an even stronger commitment to support countries in ensuring that every girl receives the quality education she deserves.Our 162 active projects (as of February 2024) are impacting more than 150 million girls and young women worldwide. Removing barriers to schoolingAddressing financial barriers, through scholarships, stipends, grants, conditional cash transfersAddressing long distances and lack of safety to and from school by building schools, providing transportation methods for girls to get to schoolAddressing a lack of information about returns to girls’ education but running community awareness campaigns engaging parents, school leaders, and local community leadersWorking with the community to address and inform on social and cultural norms and perceptions that may prevent girls’ education2. Developing skills and empowering girls for life and labor market success Promoting girls’ empowerment, skills development programs and social programsPrioritizing and promoting women in STEM subjects and careers in both traditional and non-traditional sectorsReducing barriers and providing incentives through scholarships for women to enroll in higher education and TVET programsSupport for childcare programs for women and girls to join the labor marketFor more information on our girls’ education investment and projects, please read Count Me In: The World Bank Education Global Practice: Improving Education Outcomes for Girls and Women (PDF), which highlights our decades-long commitment to girls’ education, and showcases how Education GP projects are creating opportunities for girls around the world to succeed in their education and beyond. Our focus on girls’ education and wellbeing goes beyond school attendance and learning outcomes – we strive to ensure girls have safe, joyful, and inclusive experience with education systems that set them up for success in life and motivate them to become lifelong learners. Removing barriers to girls’ schoolingOur projects providing stipends to improve primary and secondary school completion for girls and young women in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Sahel benefit close to half a million girls. Our Girls Empowerment and Learning for All Project in Angola will use a variety of financial incentives to attract adolescent girls to schools, including scholarships, and new school spaces for girls. In Honduras, the Early Childhood Education Improvement Project, will create a revised preschool curriculum that will include content on gender equity, inclusion, and violence prevention, as well as training for teachers, including training to combat GBV.The Girls Empowerment and Quality Education for All Project in Sao Tome & Principe is creating girls’ clubs after school, where they are also provided with life skills training, and counseling.4. The Côte d'Ivoire Higher Education Development Support Project provides scholarships for women in higher education, and extra tutoring support for females pursuing STEM subjects.Schemes to increase participation of girls in higher education.

Girls' Education
Every day, girls face barriers to education caused by poverty, cultural norms and practices, poor infrastructure, violence and fragility. As the largest financing development partner in education globally, the World Bank ensures that all of its education projects are gender-sensitive, and works to overcome barriers that are preventing girls and boys from equally benefiting from countries’ investments in education.Girls’ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school; have the opportunity to complete all levels of education, acquiring the knowledge and skills to compete in the labor market; gain socio-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world; make decisions about their own lives; and contribute to their communities and the world.Both individuals and countries benefit from girls’ education. A 2018 World Bank study estimates that the “limited educational opportunities for girls, and barriers to completing 12 years of education, cost countries between US$15 trillion and $30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity and earnings.” All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and countries out of poverty.The ChallengeAccording to UNICEF  estimates, around the world, 122 million girls are out of school, including 34 million of primary school age, and 87 million of secondary school age. But while enrollment rates are similar – in fact, two-thirds of all countries have reached gender parity in primary school enrollment – completion rates for girls are lower in low-income countries where 63% of female primary school students complete primary school, compared to 67% of male primary school students. Studies consistently reinforce that girls who face multiple disadvantages — such as low family income, living in remote or underserved locations or who have a disability or belong to a minority ethno-linguistic group — are farthest behind in terms of access to and completion of education.Violence also prevents girls from accessing and completing education – often girls are forced to walk long distances to school placing them at an increased risk of violence and many experience violence while at school. Working through interventions in education, health, social protection, water, infrastructure, and other sectors, we are making an even stronger commitment to support countries in ensuring that every girl receives the quality education she deserves.Our 162 active projects (as of February 2024) are impacting more than 150 million girls and young women worldwide. Removing barriers to schoolingAddressing financial barriers, through scholarships, stipends, grants, conditional cash transfersAddressing long distances and lack of safety to and from school by building schools, providing transportation methods for girls to get to schoolAddressing a lack of information about returns to girls’ education but running community awareness campaigns engaging parents, school leaders, and local community leadersWorking with the community to address and inform on social and cultural norms and perceptions that may prevent girls’ education2.

Ensuring that all girls and young women receive a quality education is their human right, a global development priority, and a strategic priority for the World Bank. As the largest financing development partner in education globally, the World Bank ensures that all of its education projects are gender-sensitive, and works to overcome barriers that are preventing girls and boys from equally benefiting from countries’ investments in education.Girls’ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school; have the opportunity to complete all levels of education, acquiring the knowledge and skills to compete in the labor market; gain socio-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world; make decisions about their own lives; and contribute to their communities and the world.Both individuals and countries benefit from girls’ education. A 2018 World Bank study estimates that the “limited educational opportunities for girls, and barriers to completing 12 years of education, cost countries between US$15 trillion and $30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity and earnings.” All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and countries out of poverty.The ChallengeAccording to UNICEF  estimates, around the world, 122 million girls are out of school, including 34 million of primary school age, and 87 million of secondary school age. But while enrollment rates are similar – in fact, two-thirds of all countries have reached gender parity in primary school enrollment – completion rates for girls are lower in low-income countries where 63% of female primary school students complete primary school, compared to 67% of male primary school students. Studies consistently reinforce that girls who face multiple disadvantages — such as low family income, living in remote or underserved locations or who have a disability or belong to a minority ethno-linguistic group — are farthest behind in terms of access to and completion of education.Violence also prevents girls from accessing and completing education – often girls are forced to walk long distances to school placing them at an increased risk of violence and many experience violence while at school. Working through interventions in education, health, social protection, water, infrastructure, and other sectors, we are making an even stronger commitment to support countries in ensuring that every girl receives the quality education she deserves.Our 162 active projects (as of February 2024) are impacting more than 150 million girls and young women worldwide. Removing barriers to schoolingAddressing financial barriers, through scholarships, stipends, grants, conditional cash transfersAddressing long distances and lack of safety to and from school by building schools, providing transportation methods for girls to get to schoolAddressing a lack of information about returns to girls’ education but running community awareness campaigns engaging parents, school leaders, and local community leadersWorking with the community to address and inform on social and cultural norms and perceptions that may prevent girls’ education2.

Removing barriers to girls’ schoolingOur projects providing stipends to improve primary and secondary school completion for girls and young women in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Sahel benefit close to half a million girls. Our Girls Empowerment and Learning for All Project in Angola will use a variety of financial incentives to attract adolescent girls to schools, including scholarships, and new school spaces for girls. In Honduras, the Early Childhood Education Improvement Project, will create a revised preschool curriculum that will include content on gender equity, inclusion, and violence prevention, as well as training for teachers, including training to combat GBV.The Girls Empowerment and Quality Education for All Project in Sao Tome & Principe is creating girls’ clubs after school, where they are also provided with life skills training, and counseling.4.

As the largest financing development partner in education globally, the World Bank ensures that all of its education projects are gender-sensitive, and works to overcome barriers that are preventing girls and boys from equally benefiting from countries’ investments in education.Girls’ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school; have the opportunity to complete all levels of education, acquiring the knowledge and skills to compete in the labor market; gain socio-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world; make decisions about their own lives; and contribute to their communities and the world.Both individuals and countries benefit from girls’ education. A 2018 World Bank study estimates that the “limited educational opportunities for girls, and barriers to completing 12 years of education, cost countries between US$15 trillion and $30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity and earnings.” All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and countries out of poverty.The ChallengeAccording to UNICEF  estimates, around the world, 122 million girls are out of school, including 34 million of primary school age, and 87 million of secondary school age. But while enrollment rates are similar – in fact, two-thirds of all countries have reached gender parity in primary school enrollment – completion rates for girls are lower in low-income countries where 63% of female primary school students complete primary school, compared to 67% of male primary school students. Studies consistently reinforce that girls who face multiple disadvantages — such as low family income, living in remote or underserved locations or who have a disability or belong to a minority ethno-linguistic group — are farthest behind in terms of access to and completion of education.Violence also prevents girls from accessing and completing education – often girls are forced to walk long distances to school placing them at an increased risk of violence and many experience violence while at school.

Studies consistently reinforce that girls who face multiple disadvantages — such as low family income, living in remote or underserved locations or who have a disability or belong to a minority ethno-linguistic group — are farthest behind in terms of access to and completion of education.Violence also prevents girls from accessing and completing education – often girls are forced to walk long distances to school placing them at an increased risk of violence and many experience violence while at school. As the largest financing development partner in education globally, the World Bank ensures that all of its education projects are gender-sensitive, and works to overcome barriers that are preventing girls and boys from equally benefiting from countries’ investments in education.

Progress on women’s rights and gender equality
Speakers highlighted that despite significant strides, progress on gender equality, the rights and empowerment of all women and girls remains slow. There is still a long way to go to fully implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in an equal, inclusive, and sustainable manner.”
Nadine Gasman, President of the National Institute for Women of Mexico: “We need a Pact of the Future with a gender and intersectional perspective, as there is no viable way to guarantee a healthy, peaceful, and secure world for future generations without it.”
Isabelle Rome, Ambassador for Human Rights, France: “There will be no equality as long as there is violence against women. Since the landmark 1985 World Conference on the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies that reviewed and appraised the achievements of the UN Decade of Women and the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the country has made significant progress in and around the 12 critical areas of concern.”
Birgitte Nygaard Markussen, Director for Humanitarian Action and Civil society Department, Denmark: “It is our hope that the outcomes of Beijing+30 and the outcome of the International Conference on Financing for Development will lead to strong international commitments that place financing for gender equality at the core.”

Stressing on the importance of placing gender equality at the heart of the Pact for the Future, an inter-governmentally negotiated outcome agreement expected at the end of the Summit of the Future (22 – 23 September), Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed said: “The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains a visionary, forward looking roadmap for realizing the rights of women and girls – and Beijing+30 is a unique opportunity to get back on track for SDG 5.”  
“We need intersectional, decolonial, feminist agenda of the future,” said Sascha Gabizon, representing the Women’s Major Group, highlighting the critical role of feminist and women’s organizations and urging governments to fund feminist mobilization and feminist, transformative agendas.

Progress on women’s rights and gender equality
Speakers highlighted that despite significant strides, progress on gender equality, the rights and empowerment of all women and girls remains slow. There is still a long way to go to fully implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in an equal, inclusive, and sustainable manner.”
Nadine Gasman, President of the National Institute for Women of Mexico: “We need a Pact of the Future with a gender and intersectional perspective, as there is no viable way to guarantee a healthy, peaceful, and secure world for future generations without it.”
Isabelle Rome, Ambassador for Human Rights, France: “There will be no equality as long as there is violence against women. Since the landmark 1985 World Conference on the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies that reviewed and appraised the achievements of the UN Decade of Women and the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the country has made significant progress in and around the 12 critical areas of concern.”
Birgitte Nygaard Markussen, Director for Humanitarian Action and Civil society Department, Denmark: “It is our hope that the outcomes of Beijing+30 and the outcome of the International Conference on Financing for Development will lead to strong international commitments that place financing for gender equality at the core.”

Birgitte Nygaard Markussen, Director for Humanitarian Action and Civil society Department, Denmark: “It is our hope that the outcomes of Beijing+30 and the outcome of the International Conference on Financing for Development will lead to strong international commitments that place financing for gender equality at the core.”

Progress on women’s rights and gender equality
Speakers highlighted that despite significant strides, progress on gender equality, the rights and empowerment of all women and girls remains slow. There is still a long way to go to fully implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in an equal, inclusive, and sustainable manner.”
Nadine Gasman, President of the National Institute for Women of Mexico: “We need a Pact of the Future with a gender and intersectional perspective, as there is no viable way to guarantee a healthy, peaceful, and secure world for future generations without it.”

		Girls Get Equal	














Girls Get Equal: 2018 – 2024
The Girls Get Equal campaign created with youth activists around the world, supported girls and young women, in all their diversity, to claim power over their own lives and to shape the world around them. Girls Get Equal had three demands: for girls and young women to have equal power to take part in all decisions that affect their lives; equal freedom so they are safe to speak up in public and online without fear of violence; and equal representation with an end to harmful stereotypes that hold them back. Girls Takeover
Launch and Equal Representation: 2018 & 2019
Equal Freedom: 2020 & 2021
Equal Power: 2022 & 2023



Girls Takeover
Over five years, Girls Get Equal has facilitated 6000 Girls’ Takeovers, including: the Presidents of Paraguay, Malawi, Guinea-Bissau, Switzerland, and Timor-Leste, the Vice Presidents of Colombia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, the Regional President of Ethiopia, the President of the Swiss Confederation, the President of the Parliament of the Central African Republic, the National Palace of the Dominican Republic, news stations, Embassies, UN agencies, and many more. Girls Get Equal also inspired over 2 billion steps for gender equality through campaign actions and events securing over 1300 new commitments from leaders and key stakeholders to directly support girls’ leadership and young people’s activism. Launch and Equal Representation: 2018 & 2019
At the launch of Girls Get Equal, girls collected 70,000 signatures from across the world as commitments to stand in solidarity with young people and put pressure on power holders and decision-makers for greater efforts to achieving gender equality. Plan International Nepal launched the Girls Get Equal campaign with a storytelling event calling for solutions to the problems girls face in the country. Equal Freedom: 2020 & 2021
For International Day of the Girl 2020 girls wrote an open letter to the major social media platforms, calling on them to address their reporting mechanisms for online abuse. In South Sudan, the Country Commissioner, County Education administrator, and Minister Youth and Sports made commitments to support the freedom to participate and better representation including promotion of girls’ online education, ending child marriage and unintended early pregnancies on social media and in policy development and reviews of initiatives for girl’s empowerment. Offices used the petition to influence decision-makers for change and raise awareness on online-gender based violence across global and national levels 



Equal Power: 2022 & 2023
The Equal Power Now Youth Manifesto launched on International Day of the Girl 2022. In Ecuador, for example, a local Manifesto emphasised the importance of quality education for girls and young women and was delivered to the Ministry of Education 
To mark the International Day of the Girl, Plan International Guinea Bissau held a reflection to discuss girls’ leadership and young women’s political participation. During a takeover at the Office of the Vice President on International Day of the Girl, Sierra Leone‘s Vice President emphasised the government’s commitment to education and the empowerment of women and girls, and pledged to continue creating opportunities for girls to develop, access education, and pursue careers, with the aspiration that they may one day hold the position of Vice President for more than just a day.

Violence against children,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-children,UN_organization,0.4,,"Types of violence against childrenMost violence against children involves at least one of six main types of interpersonal violence that tend to occur at different stages in a child’s development.Maltreatment (including violent punishment) involves physical, sexual and psychological/emotional violence; and neglect of infants, children and adolescents by parents, caregivers and other authority figures, most often in the home but also in settings such as schools and orphanages.Bullying (including cyber-bullying) is unwanted aggressive behaviour by another child or group of children who are neither siblings nor in a romantic relationship with the victim. It involves repeated physical, psychological or social harm, and often takes place in schools and other settings where children gather, and online.Youth violence is concentrated among children and young adults aged 10–29 years, occurs most often in community settings between acquaintances and strangers, includes bullying and physical assault with or without weapons (such as guns and knives), and may involve gang violence.Intimate partner violence (or domestic violence) involves physical, sexual and emotional violence by an intimate partner or ex-partner. Among romantically involved but unmarried adolescents it is sometimes called “dating violence”.Sexual violence includes non-consensual completed or attempted sexual contact and acts of a sexual nature not involving contact (such as voyeurism or sexual harassment); acts of sexual trafficking committed against someone who is unable to consent or refuse; and online exploitation.Emotional or psychological violence includes restricting a child’s movements, denigration, ridicule, threats and intimidation, discrimination, rejection and other non-physical forms of hostile treatment.When directed against girls or boys because of their biological sex or gender identity, any of these types of violence can also constitute gender-based violence.Impact of violenceViolence against children has lifelong impacts on health and well-being of children, families, communities, and nations. Important risk factors are:Individual level:biological and personal aspects such as sex and agelower levels of educationlow incomehaving a disability or mental health problemsidentifying as or being identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgenderharmful use of alcohol and drugsa history of exposure to violence.Close-relationship level:lack of emotional bonding between children and parents or caregiverspoor parenting practicesfamily dysfunction and separationbeing associated with delinquent peerswitnessing violence between parents or caregiversearly or forced marriage.Community level:povertyhigh population densitylow social cohesion and transient populationseasy access to alcohol and firearmshigh concentrations of gangs and illicit drug dealing.Society level:social and gender norms that create a climate in which violence is normalizedhealth, economic, educational and social policies that maintain economic, gender and social inequalitiesabsent or inadequate social protectionpost-conflict situations or natural disastersettings with weak governance and poor law enforcement.Prevention and responseViolence against children can be prevented.

Comprehensive sexuality education
Plan International believes that all children, adolescents and young people – without discrimination – are entitled to comprehensive sexuality education. Delivering and supporting positive and inclusive comprehensive sexuality education is a core component of our sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) work. CSE – the statistics 


Plan International reports that that 69% participants in projects implementing sexuality education and dialogue activities in 2024 feel able to make informed decisions about their SRHR, including 72% of girls and young women, 67% of boys and young men. We support CSE globally through our evidence-based CSE Programme and Influencing Model, which Plan has developed over several years. It teaches a positive approach to sexuality, promoting healthy sexual development and empowering children and young people to navigate and transform gender-unequal environments and is a comprehensive sex education curriculum. Key materials developed as part of the CSE model include:  

14 CSE standards to guide educators and ensure a comprehensive, human rights-based, gender-transformative, inclusive, and sex-positive approach. CSE Topics Table that covers 7 key areas of CSE education: relationships, values, rights and sexuality, gender, violence and safety, the human body and development, sexuality and sexual behaviour, and sexual and reproductive health. Building bridges
Engaging parents and caregivers in CSE
This 10-session training curriculum gives parents tools to discuss and communicate with their young adolescent children about relationships and sexuality and increase their knowledge of SRHR. Read more

Comprehensive sexuality education
Plan International believes that all children, adolescents and young people – without discrimination – are entitled to comprehensive sexuality education. CSE – the statistics 


Plan International reports that that 69% participants in projects implementing sexuality education and dialogue activities in 2024 feel able to make informed decisions about their SRHR, including 72% of girls and young women, 67% of boys and young men. We support CSE globally through our evidence-based CSE Programme and Influencing Model, which Plan has developed over several years. It teaches a positive approach to sexuality, promoting healthy sexual development and empowering children and young people to navigate and transform gender-unequal environments and is a comprehensive sex education curriculum. Key materials developed as part of the CSE model include:  

14 CSE standards to guide educators and ensure a comprehensive, human rights-based, gender-transformative, inclusive, and sex-positive approach. CSE Topics Table that covers 7 key areas of CSE education: relationships, values, rights and sexuality, gender, violence and safety, the human body and development, sexuality and sexual behaviour, and sexual and reproductive health. Building bridges
Engaging parents and caregivers in CSE
This 10-session training curriculum gives parents tools to discuss and communicate with their young adolescent children about relationships and sexuality and increase their knowledge of SRHR. Read more

This is the Future Girls Want
What is the future girls want to see? 5 girls’ rights at risk without urgent action
Over recent years, we have seen the regression of rights in several areas which directly impact the lives of children and young people, especially girls, including: 

banning comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) – denying essential information to children, adolescents and young people 


restricting access to and funding for safe abortion  


anti LGBTQIA+ laws  


excluding girls and women from education, work and public spaces  


lowering the age of marriage 

This negative shift is part of a deliberate effort by a growing anti-rights movement, which uses divisive narratives to polarise the public and maintain patriarchal norms and power structures. Plan International invited 15 adolescent girls and young women from 11 countries from around the world to imagine a future 30 years from now where governments and policymakers fully adopted the recommendations made by adolescent girls and young people on the occasion of the Beijing+30 celebration.

Never backing down: Women march forward for equal rights




















For centuries, women have fought for equal rights, opportunities, and freedom. In 1995, world leaders committed to gender equality with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a groundbreaking plan that set bold goals for women’s rights. 2025 is our turning point — starting 8 March, International Women’s Day, we march forward for ALL women and girls. Timeline of women's rights from 1848 to 2025











                                  1848
                              

The movement to claim women’s rights takes off 



At the Seneca Falls Convention in New York, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott demand civil, social, and political rights for women. 1851
              













                                  1893
                              

Women in New Zealand trigger a global quest to vote 



New Zealand becomes the first country to grant women the right to vote. 1893
              













                                  1911
                              

A million people mark the first International Women’s Day



On 8 March, across Europe, over 1 million people mark the first International Women’s Day by protesting for women’s suffrage and labour rights. 1911
              













                                  1929
                              

Nigerian women riot for tax relief



Thousands of Igbo women rise up against colonial rule by singing, dancing, banging on their walls and even tearing down roofs. Photo: Oloko women behind the Aba Women's Riot of 1929, Ikwuano Local Government Area of Abia State, Nigeria. 1945
              













                                  1945
                              

The United Nations is born – with a demand for equality



During the founding of the United Nations after World War II, women delegates push to enshrine gender equality in the founding Charter, which recognizes the “equal rights of men and women”. At the inaugural session of the UN General Assembly, Eleanor Roosevelt famously reads an “open letter to the women of the world”, urging increased involvement of women in national and international affairs. 1945
              













                                  1946
                              

The UN Commission on the Status of Women is born



One of the first steps of the new United Nations is to form the Commission on the Status of Women. 1946
              













                                  1948
                              

A first in human history: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 



The declaration famously states that fundamental rights belong to everyone—including all women and girls. Photo: A group of Japanese women looking at a Universal Declaration of Human Rights poster during their visit at U.N United Nations, Lake Success, New York. 1960
              













                                  1970
                              

Women unite at the First World Conference on Women



Held in Mexico, the conference is a galvanizing moment, linking women’s movements from around the world and ramping up global discourse on women’s rights. 1970 also marks the first International Women’s Year and the first UN Decade for Women. 1972
              













                                  1975
                              

In Iceland, women take a day off  



When 90 per cent of women refuse to work, cook or care for children for a day, the country comes to a halt. 1975
              













                                  1979
                              

CEDAW becomes the women’s bill of rights



Pushed by the increasingly global women’s movement, the United Nations General Assembly established the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 1979
              













                                  1981
                              

A global cry to end violence against women



Honouring the Mirabal sisters, activists from Latin America and the Caribbean declare 25 November a day to call for ending violence against women. 1994
              













                                  1995

How we work 

		Because I am a Girl	





The global campaign to transform girls’ lives through education, Because I am a Girl, ran from 2012 to 2018. Together with girls and our supporters we were able to raise hundreds of millions of euros, change laws in numerous countries and, most importantly, support millions of girls to get an education. This marked the start of a growing focus from Plan International on the needs and rights of girls that resulted in Because I am a Girl transforming girls’ lives in over 70 countries. 2007 – Tracking the State of the World’s Girls

Between 2007 and 2015, we released a series of annual reports focusing on girls and young women in the world. The State of the World’s Girls reports brought together leading thinkers, activists and policy makers to provide a wealth of data and the experiences of marginalised girls from around the world on the major issues facings them. 2002 – Securing an international day for girls

While there has long been an International Women’s Day and an International Day of the Child, neither recognise the unique position of girls who are discriminated against simply for being young and female. The targets of the campaign were to:

Directly reach 4 million girls through programmes
Indirectly reach 40 million children through programmes
Reach 400 million children through policy changes
Raise €500 million

Watch our award-winning stop-motion film I’ll take it from here which explains the importance of girls’ education. 2011 – Landmarks turn pink for girls’ education
Every year on International Day of the Girl, famous buildings and landmarks were lit up in pink to raise public awareness of the importance of girls’ education. 2014



Smashing the barriers keeping girls out of school
As part of Because I am a Girl, programmes ran across the world to tear down the barriers preventing girls from getting an education. Raise your hand
In 2012, Plan International launched the Raise Your Hand petition to put pressure on the UN to prioritise girls’ education in the Global Goals. In that period, it had:

Directly impacted the lives of over 3 million girls, over 75% of the initial target
Raised over €436 million, over 87% of the initial target
Contributed to changing laws or policies in 17 countries







2015 – influencing the international development agenda for girls

Our work to influence the Global Goals began in 2011. Girls stepped into the shoes of leaders in more than 50 countries to call on their governments to remove the barriers that deny millions their rights and stop girls going to school. 2018 – 2023 Girls Get Equal
Plan International’s next global campaign, Girls Get Equal, was a youth-led social change campaign created to ensure every girl and young woman has power over her life and the world around her. Instead of focusing on a single issue, such as girls’ education, Girls Get Equal aimed to change the way girls are valued in society so they no longer have to face injustice and oppression.

Strategic objective A.1. Women and Poverty
 


More than 1 billion people in the world today, the great
              majority of
              whom are women, live in unacceptable conditions of poverty,
              mostly in the
              developing countries. In order to
              eradicate
              poverty and achieve sustainable development, women and men must
              participate
              fully and equally in the formulation of macroeconomic and social
              policies and
              strategies for the eradication of poverty. The eradication of
              poverty cannot
              be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will
              require
              democratic participation and changes in economic structures in
              order to ensure
              access for all women to resources, opportunities and public
              services. Women's poverty is directly related to the absence of
              economic
              opportunities and autonomy, lack of access to economic resources,
              including
              credit, land ownership and inheritance, lack of access to
              education and
              support services and their minimal participation in the
              decision-making
              process. In many developed countries, where the level of general
              education and
              professional training of women and men are similar and where
              systems of
              protection against discrimination are available, in some sectors
              the economic
              transformations of the past decade have strongly increased either
              the
              unemployment of women or the precarious nature of their
              employment. In countries with economies in transition and in other
              countries
              undergoing fundamental political, economic and social
              transformations, these                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               transformations have often led to a reduction in women's income
              or to women
              being deprived of income. Review, adopt and maintain macroeconomic policies and
          development strategies that address the needs and efforts of
          women in poverty

                    poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing
                    gender-based
                    inequality within the overall framework of achieving
                    people-centred sustainable
                    development;

Develop agricultural and fishing sectors, where and as
                    necessary, in order to
                    ensure, as appropriate, household and national food security and
                    food

                    households;                  
 


Develop and implement anti-poverty programmes, including
                    employment schemes,

                    including through the use of appropriate pricing and distribution mechanisms;                  
 


Ensure the full realization of the human rights of all women
                    migrants,
                    including women migrant workers, and their protection against
                    violence and
                    exploitation; introduce measures for the empowerment of
                    documented women migrants,
                    including women migrant workers; facilitate the productive
                    employment of
                    documented migrant women through greater recognition of their
                    skills, foreign
                    education and credentials, and facilitate their full integration
                    into the labour
                    force;                  
 


Introduce measures to integrate or reintegrate women living
                    in poverty and
                    socially marginalized women into productive employment and the
                    economic
                    mainstream; ensure that internally displaced women have full
                    access to economic
                    opportunities and that the qualifications and skills of immigrant
                    and refugee
                    women are recognized;                  
 


Enable women to obtain affordable housing and access to land
                    by, among other
                    things, removing all obstacles to access, with special emphasis
                    on meeting the
                    needs of women, especially those living in poverty and female
                    heads of household;                  
 


Formulate and implement policies and programmes that enhance
                    the access of
                    women agricultural and fisheries producers (including subsistence
                    farmers and
                    producers, especially in rural areas) to financial, technical,
                    extension and
                    marketing services; provide access to and control of land,
                    appropriate
                    infrastructure and technology in order to increase women's
                    incomes and promote
                    household food security, especially in rural areas and, where
                    appropriate,
                    encourage the development of producer-owned, market-based
                    cooperatives;                  
 


Create social security systems wherever they do not exist, or
                    review them with a view to placing individual women and men on an equal footing, at every stage of their lives;                  
 


Ensure access to free or low-cost legal services, including
                    legal literacy,

                              multilateral debt, with a view to alleviating their debt burden;                            
 


Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are designed to
                              minimize their
                              negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and
                              communities and to
                              assure their positive effects on such groups and communities by
                              preventing their
                              marginalization in economic and social activities and devising

                              disproportionate burden of
                              transition costs; complement adjustment lending with enhanced,
                              targeted social

Strategic objective A.1. Women and Poverty
 


More than 1 billion people in the world today, the great
              majority of
              whom are women, live in unacceptable conditions of poverty,
              mostly in the
              developing countries. In order to
              eradicate
              poverty and achieve sustainable development, women and men must
              participate
              fully and equally in the formulation of macroeconomic and social
              policies and
              strategies for the eradication of poverty. The eradication of
              poverty cannot
              be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will
              require
              democratic participation and changes in economic structures in
              order to ensure
              access for all women to resources, opportunities and public
              services. Women's poverty is directly related to the absence of
              economic
              opportunities and autonomy, lack of access to economic resources,
              including
              credit, land ownership and inheritance, lack of access to
              education and
              support services and their minimal participation in the
              decision-making
              process. In many developed countries, where the level of general
              education and
              professional training of women and men are similar and where
              systems of
              protection against discrimination are available, in some sectors
              the economic
              transformations of the past decade have strongly increased either
              the
              unemployment of women or the precarious nature of their
              employment. In countries with economies in transition and in other
              countries
              undergoing fundamental political, economic and social

              or to women
              being deprived of income. Review, adopt and maintain macroeconomic policies and
          development strategies that address the needs and efforts of

                  macroeconomic and social policies with a view to achieving the
                  objectives of the
                  Platform for Action;                


 


Analyse, from a gender perspective, policies and programmes -

                    - with respect to their impact on poverty, on inequality and
                    particularly on
                    women; assess their impact on family well-being and conditions
                    and adjust them,
                    as appropriate, to promote more equitable distribution of
                    productive assets,
                    wealth, opportunities, income and services;

                    poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing
                    gender-based
                    inequality within the overall framework of achieving
                    people-centred sustainable
                    development;                  
 


Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures
                    to promote
                    women's economic opportunities and equal access to productive
                    resources and to
                    address the basic social, educational and health needs of women,
                    particularly
                    those living in poverty;                  
 


Develop agricultural and fishing sectors, where and as
                    necessary, in order to
                    ensure, as appropriate, household and national food security and
                    food
                    self-sufficiency, by allocating the necessary financial,
                    technical and human
                    resources;

                    distribution of food
                    within the household;                  
 


Provide adequate safety nets and strengthen State-based and
                    community-based
                    support systems, as an integral part of social policy, in order
                    to enable women
                    living in poverty to withstand adverse economic environments and
                    preserve their

                    long-term unemployment;                  
 


Formulate and implement, when necessary, specific economic,
                    social,
                    agricultural and related policies in support of female-headed
                    households;                  
 


Develop and implement anti-poverty programmes, including
                    employment schemes,
                    that improve access to food for women living in poverty,
                    including through the use of appropriate pricing and distribution mechanisms;                  
 


Ensure the full realization of the human rights of all women
                    migrants,
                    including women migrant workers, and their protection against
                    violence and
                    exploitation; introduce measures for the empowerment of
                    documented women migrants,
                    including women migrant workers; facilitate the productive
                    employment of
                    documented migrant women through greater recognition of their
                    skills, foreign
                    education and credentials, and facilitate their full integration
                    into the labour
                    force;

                    economic
                    mainstream; ensure that internally displaced women have full
                    access to economic
                    opportunities and that the qualifications and skills of immigrant

                    women are recognized;                  
 


Enable women to obtain affordable housing and access to land
                    by, among other
                    things, removing all obstacles to access, with special emphasis
                    on meeting the
                    needs of women, especially those living in poverty and female
                    heads of household;                  
 


Formulate and implement policies and programmes that enhance
                    the access of
                    women agricultural and fisheries producers (including subsistence
                    farmers and
                    producers, especially in rural areas) to financial, technical,
                    extension and
                    marketing services; provide access to and control of land,
                    appropriate
                    infrastructure and technology in order to increase women's
                    incomes and promote
                    household food security, especially in rural areas and, where
                    appropriate,
                    encourage the development of producer-owned, market-based
                    cooperatives;                  
 


Create social security systems wherever they do not exist, or
                    review them with a view to placing individual women and men on an equal footing, at every stage of their lives;                  
 


Ensure access to free or low-cost legal services, including
                    legal literacy,

                              assure their positive effects on such groups and communities by
                              preventing their
                              marginalization in economic and social activities and devising

                              disproportionate burden of
                              transition costs; complement adjustment lending with enhanced,
                              targeted social

Go back to Index

More than 1 billion people in the world today, the great
              majority of
              whom are women, live in unacceptable conditions of poverty,
              mostly in the
              developing countries. In order to
              eradicate
              poverty and achieve sustainable development, women and men must
              participate
              fully and equally in the formulation of macroeconomic and social
              policies and
              strategies for the eradication of poverty. Women's poverty is directly related to the absence of
              economic
              opportunities and autonomy, lack of access to economic resources,
              including
              credit, land ownership and inheritance, lack of access to
              education and
              support services and their minimal participation in the
              decision-making
              process. In many developed countries, where the level of general
              education and
              professional training of women and men are similar and where
              systems of
              protection against discrimination are available, in some sectors
              the economic
              transformations of the past decade have strongly increased either
              the
              unemployment of women or the precarious nature of their
              employment. In countries with economies in transition and in other
              countries
              undergoing fundamental political, economic and social
              transformations, these                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               transformations have often led to a reduction in women's income
              or to women
              being deprived of income. Review, adopt and maintain macroeconomic policies and
          development strategies that address the needs and efforts of
          women in poverty

Actions to be taken

By Governments:

Review and modify, with the full and equal participation of
                  women,
                  macroeconomic and social policies with a view to achieving the
                  objectives of the
                  Platform for Action;

Analyse, from a gender perspective, policies and programmes -
                    including those

                    external debt problems,
                    taxation, investments, employment, markets and all relevant
                    sectors of the economy
                    - with respect to their impact on poverty, on inequality and
                    particularly on
                    women; assess their impact on family well-being and conditions
                    and adjust them,
                    as appropriate, to promote more equitable distribution of
                    productive assets,
                    wealth, opportunities, income and services;

Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and
                    sectoral policies that
                    are designed and monitored with the full and equal participation
                    of women,
                    encourage broad-based sustained economic growth, address the
                    structural causes of
                    poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing
                    gender-based
                    inequality within the overall framework of achieving
                    people-centred sustainable
                    development;

Restructure and target the allocation of public expenditures
                    to promote
                    women's economic opportunities and equal access to productive
                    resources and to
                    address the basic social, educational and health needs of women,
                    particularly
                    those living in poverty;

Develop agricultural and fishing sectors, where and as
                    necessary, in order to
                    ensure, as appropriate, household and national food security and
                    food
                    self-sufficiency, by allocating the necessary financial,
                    technical and human
                    resources;

                    distribution of food
                    within the household;

Provide adequate safety nets and strengthen State-based and
                    community-based
                    support systems, as an integral part of social policy, in order
                    to enable women
                    living in poverty to withstand adverse economic environments and

Formulate and implement, when necessary, specific economic,
                    social,

                    households;

Develop and implement anti-poverty programmes, including
                    employment schemes,

                    including through the use of appropriate pricing and distribution mechanisms;

Ensure the full realization of the human rights of all women
                    migrants,
                    including women migrant workers, and their protection against
                    violence and
                    exploitation; introduce measures for the empowerment of
                    documented women migrants,
                    including women migrant workers; facilitate the productive
                    employment of
                    documented migrant women through greater recognition of their
                    skills, foreign

Enable women to obtain affordable housing and access to land
                    by, among other
                    things, removing all obstacles to access, with special emphasis
                    on meeting the

                    incomes and promote
                    household food security, especially in rural areas and, where
                    appropriate,
                    encourage the development of producer-owned, market-based
                    cooperatives;

                              innovative
                              approaches to assisting low-income countries with a high
                              proportion of
                              multilateral debt, with a view to alleviating their debt burden;

Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are designed to
                              minimize their
                              negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and
                              communities and to
                              assure their positive effects on such groups and communities by
                              preventing their
                              marginalization in economic and social activities and devising
                              measures to ensure
                              that they gain access to and control over economic resources and
                              economic and
                              social activities; take actions to reduce inequality and economic disparity;

                              social development
                              by means of gender-sensitive social impact assessments and other
                              relevant methods,
                              in order to develop policies to reduce their negative effects and
                              improve their                                                                                                     positive impact, ensuring that women do not bear a
                              disproportionate burden of
                              transition costs; complement adjustment lending with enhanced,
                              targeted social
                              development lending;

Create an enabling environment that allows women to build and
                              maintain
                              sustainable livelihoods. By national and international non-governmental organizations
              and women's
              groups:

Mobilize all parties involved in the development process,
                      including academic
                      institutions, non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and
                      women's groups,
                      to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed
                      towards the
                      poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women, such as rural and
                      indigenous
                      women, female heads of household, young women and older women,
                      refugees and
                      migrant women and women with disabilities, recognizing that
                      social
                      development is primarily the responsibility of Governments;

Engage in lobbying and establish monitoring mechanisms, as
                      appropriate, and
                      other relevant activities to ensure implementation of the
                      recommendations on
                      poverty eradication outlined in the Platform for Action and aimed
                      at ensuring
                      accountability and transparency from the State and private
                      sectors;

Include in their activities women with diverse needs and
                      recognize that youth

                      poverty have
                      full access to such services; seek funding to secure access to
                      services with a
                      gender perspective and to extend those services in order to reach
                      the rural and
                      remote areas that are not covered by government institutions;

In cooperation with Governments, employers, other social
                      partners and relevant
                      parties, contribute to the development of education and training
                      and retraining

                  strengthening links
                  between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations,
                  including
                  legislative support, training for women and institutional
                  strengthening for
                  intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for
                  those institutions
                  and increasing the availability of credit;

Encourage links between financial institutions and
                              non-governmental
                              organizations and support innovative lending practices, including
                              those that
                              integrate credit with women's services and training and provide
                              credit facilities
                              to rural women. By commercial banks, specialized financial institutions and
              the private
              sector in examining their policies:

Use credit and savings methodologies that are effective in
                            reaching women in
                            poverty and innovative in reducing transaction costs and

                              women, who lack
                              access to traditional sources of collateral;

Simplify banking practices, for example by reducing the
                              minimum deposit and
                              other requirements for opening bank accounts;

Ensure the participation and joint ownership, where possible,
                                                                                                                                                                                      of women clients
                                                                                                                                                                                      in the decision-making of institutions providing credit and
                                                                                                                                                                                      financial services. By international organizations:
              
                

                  Increase funding for programmes and projects designed to
    promote
    sustainable and productive entrepreneurial activities
    for income-
    generation among disadvantaged women and women living in
    poverty. Develop gender-based methodologies
          and conduct research to address the feminization of poverty

Actions to be taken

By Governments, intergovernmental organizations, academic and
                research
                institutions and the private sector:

Develop conceptual and practical methodologies for
                    incorporating
                    gender perspectives into all aspects of economic
                    policy-making,
                    including structural adjustment planning and programmes;

Apply these methodologies in conducting gender-impact
                              analyses of
                              all policies and programmes, including structural
                              adjustment
                              programmes, and disseminate the research findings."

Notes











Impact of conflicts and crises on women and girls 
Conflict, instability, and violence are on the rise with devastating consequences for women and girls. Sexual violence in conflict rose dramatically with UN-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence soaring by 50 per cent to 3688 cases and the number of girls affected by grave violations in situations of armed conflict increased by 35 per cent. Women’s voices in media: A 2023 report by CARE found that while media coverage of conflicts increased more than six-fold between 2013 and 2023, only 5 per cent of articles focused on women’s experiences in war, and only 0.04 highlighted women’s contribution as leaders in peace processes. However women remain underrepresented in formal negotiations, here are some critical facts and figures: 

Stronger peace deals with women: Studies show that peace agreements with women signatories have higher rates of implementation and last longer. Lack of women in peace processes: Despite their critical roles, women continue to be largely excluded from peace processes. According to new global data collected by UN-Women through the Women in Peace Processes Monitor, in 2023, women made up only 9.6 per cent of negotiators, 13.7 per cent of mediators and 26.6 per cent of signatories to peace and ceasefire agreements. However, in 2023, only 26 per cent (8) peace and ceasefire agreements mentioned women, girls, or gender. Women in informal peace processes: A study of informal peace efforts found that in three quarters of cases (27 of 38) women’s groups were actively involved in grassroots-level peacebuilding. Women leading local peace efforts: Despite women’s exclusion in most formal peace efforts, women place key roles in local peacebuilding. Exclusion of women’s groups in peace processes: In many peace processes, those igniting wars are invited to the negotiating table, while those seeking true peace, such as women’s groups, are sidelined. Women in the UN Security Council: Between 2015 and 2023, only 22 per cent of the Permanent Representatives of the Member States represented in the Security Council were women. Women lawmakers: In 2024, 27 per cent of national parliamentarians worldwide were women. Women in cabinets: In 2024, women hold 23 per cent of cabinet positions, compared to 19 per cent in conflict-affected​ ​countries. Women in local governments: In 2023, women held 36 per cent of elected seats in local governments. Reprisals against civil society representatives: A UN Women survey among the 45 women civil society representatives who had briefed the Security Council in 2023, 5 of 23 (22 per cent) respondents reported a reprisal in connection with their briefing at the Council. Political violence targeting women and girls: Data from Armed Conflict Location & Event Data in 2023, show that women and girls were the main targets in more than 3,000 incidents of violence worldwide, and more than half took place in conflict-affected countries [4]. Women get weak protection from human rights institutions: Among 41 conflict-affected countries and territories, only 25 (60 per cent) [5] had national human rights institutions fully or partially compliant with the Paris Principles, which set out the minimum standards for protecting and promoting human rights. However, significant obstacles persist in securing justice for women during and after conflicts: 

Increased representation of women in judiciary: As of 2021, 43 per cent of judges or magistrates globally were women, up from 34 per cent in 2010. By the end of 2023, most targets set by the United Nations Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy (UGPS) 2018-2028 had been met or exceeded, except on military contingents and staff officers [8] : 
	
Justice and corrections personnel: Women made up 43 per cent (UGPS target 30 per cent) 
Individual police officers: Women represented 31 per cent (UGPS target 24 per cent)  
Military experts on mission and staff officers: Women accounted for 22 per cent (UGPS target 20 per cent) 
Formed police units: Women represented 16 per cent (UGPS target 13 per cent) 
Military contingents: Women accounted for 7 per cent (UGPS target 10 per cent)  


The number of military women involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations has increased steadily. In a study of 30 countries, the proportion of women in national armed forces increased to 14 per cent in 2022, compared with 11 per cent in 2016 [10]. Local, national and regional policies on Women, Peace, and Security

National action plans (NAPs) are important tools that help countries implement global commitments on the women, peace, and security agenda within domestic politics. ​Of these: ​ 
	
​​​The Compact on Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action provides a path for Member States, United Nations entities, regional organizations, private sector actors, and civil society – including women-led and youth organizations and academic institutions – to drive  Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action from 2021 to 2026. Climate change in women, peace, and security policies: References to climate change are  increasingly being included in women, peace, and security policies. Challenges in funding allocation to women’s groups: A recent study examining the levels of funding reaching women’s organizations in conflict and crisis settings, which has decreased for three years in a row, found [20]:  
	
Funding initiatives are often concentrated among a few donors and in some cases may simply repackage existing allocations rather than provide new funding. Donors are familiar with the minimum 15 per cent financing target for gender equality, but they are less aware of the 1 per cent goal for women’s organizations specifically, first proposed by the UN Secretary-General during the 20th anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) and reiterated in the New Agenda for Peace. Commitments to ramp up financing of women’s rights: In 2024, the OECD Development Assistance Committee adopted a Recommendation on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of All Women and Girls in Development Co-operation and Humanitarian Assistance. Multi-partner trust funds financing women, peace and security

The United Nations Peacebuilding Fund: In 2023, the Fund approved $202.5 million in support for peacebuilding initiatives in 36 countries, of which over 47 per cent ($95.9 million) was allocated to gender equality. The United Nations Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund (WPHF): This is the only global financing mechanism dedicated to supporting local and grassroots women’s organizations in conflict and crisis settings. The Elsie Initiative Fund for Uniformed Women in Peace Operations (EIF): This innovative funding mechanism aims to increase the participation of uniformed women in UN peace operations. Women, peace and security at the Security Council

UN Security Council resolutions on women, peace, and security: Since 2000, the UN Security Council has adopted 10 key resolutions on women, peace, and security: resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013), 2122 (2013), 2242 (2015), 2467 (2019), and 2493 (2019). Women’s voices at the Security Council: Since the first woman representing civil society was invited to brief the Security Council in 2004, more than 300 women from civil society have briefed the Security Council.

Impact of conflicts and crises on women and girls 
Conflict, instability, and violence are on the rise with devastating consequences for women and girls. Sexual violence in conflict rose dramatically with UN-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence soaring by 50 per cent to 3688 cases and the number of girls affected by grave violations in situations of armed conflict increased by 35 per cent. Women’s voices in media: A 2023 report by CARE found that while media coverage of conflicts increased more than six-fold between 2013 and 2023, only 5 per cent of articles focused on women’s experiences in war, and only 0.04 highlighted women’s contribution as leaders in peace processes. However women remain underrepresented in formal negotiations, here are some critical facts and figures: 

Stronger peace deals with women: Studies show that peace agreements with women signatories have higher rates of implementation and last longer. Lack of women in peace processes: Despite their critical roles, women continue to be largely excluded from peace processes. According to new global data collected by UN-Women through the Women in Peace Processes Monitor, in 2023, women made up only 9.6 per cent of negotiators, 13.7 per cent of mediators and 26.6 per cent of signatories to peace and ceasefire agreements. However, in 2023, only 26 per cent (8) peace and ceasefire agreements mentioned women, girls, or gender. Women in informal peace processes: A study of informal peace efforts found that in three quarters of cases (27 of 38) women’s groups were actively involved in grassroots-level peacebuilding. Women leading local peace efforts: Despite women’s exclusion in most formal peace efforts, women place key roles in local peacebuilding. Exclusion of women’s groups in peace processes: In many peace processes, those igniting wars are invited to the negotiating table, while those seeking true peace, such as women’s groups, are sidelined. Women in the UN Security Council: Between 2015 and 2023, only 22 per cent of the Permanent Representatives of the Member States represented in the Security Council were women. Women lawmakers: In 2024, 27 per cent of national parliamentarians worldwide were women. Women in cabinets: In 2024, women hold 23 per cent of cabinet positions, compared to 19 per cent in conflict-affected​ ​countries. Women in local governments: In 2023, women held 36 per cent of elected seats in local governments. Reprisals against civil society representatives: A UN Women survey among the 45 women civil society representatives who had briefed the Security Council in 2023, 5 of 23 (22 per cent) respondents reported a reprisal in connection with their briefing at the Council. Political violence targeting women and girls: Data from Armed Conflict Location & Event Data in 2023, show that women and girls were the main targets in more than 3,000 incidents of violence worldwide, and more than half took place in conflict-affected countries [4]. Women get weak protection from human rights institutions: Among 41 conflict-affected countries and territories, only 25 (60 per cent) [5] had national human rights institutions fully or partially compliant with the Paris Principles, which set out the minimum standards for protecting and promoting human rights. However, significant obstacles persist in securing justice for women during and after conflicts: 

Increased representation of women in judiciary: As of 2021, 43 per cent of judges or magistrates globally were women, up from 34 per cent in 2010. By the end of 2023, most targets set by the United Nations Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy (UGPS) 2018-2028 had been met or exceeded, except on military contingents and staff officers [8] : 
	
Justice and corrections personnel: Women made up 43 per cent (UGPS target 30 per cent) 
Individual police officers: Women represented 31 per cent (UGPS target 24 per cent)  
Military experts on mission and staff officers: Women accounted for 22 per cent (UGPS target 20 per cent) 
Formed police units: Women represented 16 per cent (UGPS target 13 per cent) 
Military contingents: Women accounted for 7 per cent (UGPS target 10 per cent)  


The number of military women involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations has increased steadily. In a study of 30 countries, the proportion of women in national armed forces increased to 14 per cent in 2022, compared with 11 per cent in 2016 [10].

Climate change in women, peace, and security policies: References to climate change are  increasingly being included in women, peace, and security policies.

Impact of conflicts and crises on women and girls 
Conflict, instability, and violence are on the rise with devastating consequences for women and girls. Sexual violence in conflict rose dramatically with UN-verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence soaring by 50 per cent to 3688 cases and the number of girls affected by grave violations in situations of armed conflict increased by 35 per cent. Women’s voices in media: A 2023 report by CARE found that while media coverage of conflicts increased more than six-fold between 2013 and 2023, only 5 per cent of articles focused on women’s experiences in war, and only 0.04 highlighted women’s contribution as leaders in peace processes. However women remain underrepresented in formal negotiations, here are some critical facts and figures: 

Stronger peace deals with women: Studies show that peace agreements with women signatories have higher rates of implementation and last longer. Lack of women in peace processes: Despite their critical roles, women continue to be largely excluded from peace processes. According to new global data collected by UN-Women through the Women in Peace Processes Monitor, in 2023, women made up only 9.6 per cent of negotiators, 13.7 per cent of mediators and 26.6 per cent of signatories to peace and ceasefire agreements. Women in informal peace processes: A study of informal peace efforts found that in three quarters of cases (27 of 38) women’s groups were actively involved in grassroots-level peacebuilding. Women leading local peace efforts: Despite women’s exclusion in most formal peace efforts, women place key roles in local peacebuilding. Exclusion of women’s groups in peace processes: In many peace processes, those igniting wars are invited to the negotiating table, while those seeking true peace, such as women’s groups, are sidelined. Women in the UN Security Council: Between 2015 and 2023, only 22 per cent of the Permanent Representatives of the Member States represented in the Security Council were women. Women lawmakers: In 2024, 27 per cent of national parliamentarians worldwide were women. Women in cabinets: In 2024, women hold 23 per cent of cabinet positions, compared to 19 per cent in conflict-affected​ ​countries. Women in local governments: In 2023, women held 36 per cent of elected seats in local governments. Reprisals against civil society representatives: A UN Women survey among the 45 women civil society representatives who had briefed the Security Council in 2023, 5 of 23 (22 per cent) respondents reported a reprisal in connection with their briefing at the Council. Political violence targeting women and girls: Data from Armed Conflict Location & Event Data in 2023, show that women and girls were the main targets in more than 3,000 incidents of violence worldwide, and more than half took place in conflict-affected countries [4]. Women get weak protection from human rights institutions: Among 41 conflict-affected countries and territories, only 25 (60 per cent) [5] had national human rights institutions fully or partially compliant with the Paris Principles, which set out the minimum standards for protecting and promoting human rights. However, significant obstacles persist in securing justice for women during and after conflicts: 

Increased representation of women in judiciary: As of 2021, 43 per cent of judges or magistrates globally were women, up from 34 per cent in 2010. By the end of 2023, most targets set by the United Nations Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy (UGPS) 2018-2028 had been met or exceeded, except on military contingents and staff officers [8] : 
	
Justice and corrections personnel: Women made up 43 per cent (UGPS target 30 per cent) 
Individual police officers: Women represented 31 per cent (UGPS target 24 per cent)  
Military experts on mission and staff officers: Women accounted for 22 per cent (UGPS target 20 per cent) 
Formed police units: Women represented 16 per cent (UGPS target 13 per cent) 
Military contingents: Women accounted for 7 per cent (UGPS target 10 per cent)  


The number of military women involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations has increased steadily. In a study of 30 countries, the proportion of women in national armed forces increased to 14 per cent in 2022, compared with 11 per cent in 2016 [10]. Local, national and regional policies on Women, Peace, and Security

National action plans (NAPs) are important tools that help countries implement global commitments on the women, peace, and security agenda within domestic politics. ​Of these: ​ 
	
​​​The Compact on Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action provides a path for Member States, United Nations entities, regional organizations, private sector actors, and civil society – including women-led and youth organizations and academic institutions – to drive  Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action from 2021 to 2026. Climate change in women, peace, and security policies: References to climate change are  increasingly being included in women, peace, and security policies. Challenges in funding allocation to women’s groups: A recent study examining the levels of funding reaching women’s organizations in conflict and crisis settings, which has decreased for three years in a row, found [20]:  
	
Funding initiatives are often concentrated among a few donors and in some cases may simply repackage existing allocations rather than provide new funding. Donors are familiar with the minimum 15 per cent financing target for gender equality, but they are less aware of the 1 per cent goal for women’s organizations specifically, first proposed by the UN Secretary-General during the 20th anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) and reiterated in the New Agenda for Peace. Commitments to ramp up financing of women’s rights: In 2024, the OECD Development Assistance Committee adopted a Recommendation on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of All Women and Girls in Development Co-operation and Humanitarian Assistance. Multi-partner trust funds financing women, peace and security

The United Nations Peacebuilding Fund: In 2023, the Fund approved $202.5 million in support for peacebuilding initiatives in 36 countries, of which over 47 per cent ($95.9 million) was allocated to gender equality. The United Nations Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund (WPHF): This is the only global financing mechanism dedicated to supporting local and grassroots women’s organizations in conflict and crisis settings. The Elsie Initiative Fund for Uniformed Women in Peace Operations (EIF): This innovative funding mechanism aims to increase the participation of uniformed women in UN peace operations. Women, peace and security at the Security Council

UN Security Council resolutions on women, peace, and security: Since 2000, the UN Security Council has adopted 10 key resolutions on women, peace, and security: resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013), 2122 (2013), 2242 (2015), 2467 (2019), and 2493 (2019). Women’s voices at the Security Council: Since the first woman representing civil society was invited to brief the Security Council in 2004, more than 300 women from civil society have briefed the Security Council.

Women in peacekeeping and the security sector: Progress and challenges

Initiatives like the Elsie Initiative and Elsie Initiative Fund are helping to increase the number of women in peacekeeping roles. By the end of 2023, most targets set by the United Nations Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy (UGPS) 2018-2028 had been met or exceeded, except on military contingents and staff officers [8] : 
	
Justice and corrections personnel: Women made up 43 per cent (UGPS target 30 per cent) 
Individual police officers: Women represented 31 per cent (UGPS target 24 per cent)  
Military experts on mission and staff officers: Women accounted for 22 per cent (UGPS target 20 per cent) 
Formed police units: Women represented 16 per cent (UGPS target 13 per cent) 
Military contingents: Women accounted for 7 per cent (UGPS target 10 per cent)  


The number of military women involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations has increased steadily. In a study of 30 countries, the proportion of women in national armed forces increased to 14 per cent in 2022, compared with 11 per cent in 2016 [10].

5 girls’ rights under threat in 2025

3 March 2025
We are at a tipping point for girls’ rights. Without urgent action, girls risk having fewer rights than their mothers and, in some cases, even their grandmothers. International Women’s Day this year takes place against a backdrop of unprecedented ideological attacks, the erosion and reversal of hard-won rights around the world and severe de-funding of critical work, making efforts to advocate for girls’ rights more important than ever before. 30 years on from the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action, the landmark declaration where 189 countries adopted the most comprehensive global agenda for the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, we are at a tipping point for girls’ rights. Over recent years, we have seen the regression of rights in several areas which directly impact the lives of children and young people, especially girls. Examples include:  

banning comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) – denying essential information to children, adolescents and young people 


restricting access to and funding for safe abortion  


anti LGBTQIA+ laws  


excluding girls and women from education, work and public spaces  


lowering the age of marriage 

This negative shift is not incidental – it is part of a deliberate effort by a growing anti-rights movement, which uses divisive narratives to polarise the public and maintain patriarchal norms and power structures. The right to an education 
Globally, 122 million girls remain out of school, often due to domestic work, child marriage and harmful gender norms that undervalue their education. Annually, 60 million girls face sexual assault in schools, and 1 in 4 adolescent girls (aged 15–19) report experiencing physical or sexual violence from partners. Online harassment impacts more than half of adolescent girls, with 90% of child abuse material victims being girls. This pushback leads to climate inaction which disproportionately impacts adolescent girls, especially those in marginalised communities, exacerbates existing inequalities and prevents them from accessing key services like SRHR services and education. The right to participate in society  
Globally, children and young people, especially girls and young women, face significant challenges in realising their right to freely express their views and participate in civic and political processes. Human rights defenders, particularly girls and young women, are increasingly impacted by a political landscape that offers fewer opportunities for their advocacy and input. According to Plan International’s State of the World’s Girls (2023), 61% of girls and young women involved in activism reported facing negative consequences because of their advocacy work. The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW69) held between 10-21 March in New York provides a critical opportunity to reinforce commitments made during the Summit of the Future and push against the regressive forces that seek to diminish the rights and freedom of girls and young women.

A review published in 2014 of the health information system from 90 refugee camps across 15 low- and middle-income countries found that 41% of health-care visits for mental, neurological and substance use disorders were for epilepsy/seizures, 23% for psychotic disorders, and 13% for moderate and severe forms of depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.Effective emergency responseWHO-endorsed interagency mental health and psychosocial support guidelines for an effective response to emergencies recommend services at a number of levels – from basic services to clinical care. Clinical care for mental health should be provided by or under the supervision of mental health specialists such as psychiatric nurses, psychologists or psychiatrists.Community self-help and social support should be strengthened, for example by creating or re-establishing community groups in which members solve problems collaboratively and engage in activities such as emergency relief or learning new skills, while ensuring the involvement of people who are vulnerable and marginalized, including people with mental disorders.Psychological first aid offers first-line emotional and practical support to people experiencing acute distress due to a recent event and should be made available by field workers, including health staff, teachers or trained volunteers.Basic clinical mental health care covering priority conditions (e.g. schools, social services and emergency relief services such as those providing food, water and housing/shelter).Looking forward: emergencies can build better mental health systemsMental health is crucial to the overall social and economic recovery of individuals, societies, and countries after emergencies.Global progress on mental health reform will happen more quickly if, during every crisis, efforts are initiated to convert the short-term increase in attention to mental health issues combined with a surge of aid, into momentum for long-term service development. This led to a mental health system reform, supported by WHO, which addressed the shortage of human resources for mental health such as different cadres of dedicated mental health staff. As a result, 20 of the country’s 27 districts now have mental health services infrastructure, compared with only 10 before the tsunami.When Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines in 2013, there were only two facilities that provided basic mental health services and the number of people able to provide support was insufficient to meet the need.

What we do
Due to the powers vested in its Charter and its unique international character, the United Nations can take action on the issues confronting humanity in the 21st century, including:Maintain international peace and securityProtect human rightsDeliver humanitarian aidPromote sustainable developmentUphold international law






  
  
 Maintain International Peace and Security 
 The United Nations came into being in 1945, following the devastation of the Second World War, with one central mission: the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. Protect Human Rights 
 The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. Deliver Humanitarian Aid 
 One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is ""to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.""  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. Promote Sustainable Development 
 From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. Uphold International Law 
 The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.""  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations. Structure of the United Nations
The main parts of the UN structure are the General Assembly, theSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the UN Secretariat.

Due to the powers vested in its Charter and its unique international character, the United Nations can take action on the issues confronting humanity in the 21st century, including:Maintain international peace and securityProtect human rightsDeliver humanitarian aidPromote sustainable developmentUphold international law






  
  
 Maintain International Peace and Security 
 The United Nations came into being in 1945, following the devastation of the Second World War, with one central mission: the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. Protect Human Rights 
 The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. Deliver Humanitarian Aid 
 One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is ""to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.""  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. Promote Sustainable Development 
 From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. Uphold International Law 
 The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.""  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations. Structure of the United Nations
The main parts of the UN structure are the General Assembly, theSecurity Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the UN Secretariat. All 193 Member States of the UN are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal representation. Security Council

 One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is ""to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.""  The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. Promote Sustainable Development 
 From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”  Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. Uphold International Law 
 The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.""  Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations.

This is the Future Girls Want
What is the future girls want to see? 5 girls’ rights at risk without urgent action
Over recent years, we have seen the regression of rights in several areas which directly impact the lives of children and young people, especially girls, including: 

banning comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) – denying essential information to children, adolescents and young people 


restricting access to and funding for safe abortion  


anti LGBTQIA+ laws  


excluding girls and women from education, work and public spaces  


lowering the age of marriage 

This negative shift is part of a deliberate effort by a growing anti-rights movement, which uses divisive narratives to polarise the public and maintain patriarchal norms and power structures. Plan International invited 15 adolescent girls and young women from 11 countries from around the world to imagine a future 30 years from now where governments and policymakers fully adopted the recommendations made by adolescent girls and young people on the occasion of the Beijing+30 celebration.

Lessons from the rubble: Simple truths from monster earthquakes

28 March 2025
In the wake of Myanmar's 7.7 magnitude earthquake, 5 lessons in effective crisis response from Dr. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar’s Mandalay region and early media reports say “hundreds feared dead.”   
Strong tremors were also felt in neighbouring Thailand. Myanmar and Thailand have declared national emergencies and Myanmar is appealing for international assistance. Having worked shoulder to shoulder with local volunteers and communities in earthquake zones across India, China, Iran, Japan, Afghanistan, Haiti, Turkey, and Indonesia, I have witnessed both the unique devastation of each quake and the universal human solidarity that follows. Preparedness and caution can save lives
“Aftershocks finished the task that the main earthquake started,” a mother in Haiti told me in 2010. In Nepal after the 2015 earthquake, my colleagues from Plan International reminded me that the mega earthquake was too vast for Nepal to handle alone. In India, following the Gujarat earthquake (2001), children told me they were too scared to sleep. Imagine children cut off in remote villages, children orphaned by earthquakes lost or wandering amidst ruins, girls at risk of trafficking and abuse. Plan International prioritises all children, especially girls in disasters because emergencies amplify their pre-existing vulnerabilities, making them easy targets for exploitation. Paola Belotti, my colleague, based on her expertise on child protection in humanitarian settings and direct experience in other earthquake settings says “earthquakes expose children to immense risks—separation from family, homelessness, and vulnerability to violence”. Take the 2014 San Francisco earthquake (6.1 magnitude): roads were damaged, people were injured, but there were no immediate deaths. Compassion and solidarity: the true measure of humanity 
Humanitarian efforts must uphold the dignity of survivors and adhere to good and humane practices such as the Sphere humanitarian minimum standards. Donate to the Myanmar Earthquake Appeal

Lessons from the rubble: Simple truths from monster earthquakes

28 March 2025
In the wake of Myanmar's 7.7 magnitude earthquake, 5 lessons in effective crisis response from Dr. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar’s Mandalay region and early media reports say “hundreds feared dead.”   
Strong tremors were also felt in neighbouring Thailand. Having worked shoulder to shoulder with local volunteers and communities in earthquake zones across India, China, Iran, Japan, Afghanistan, Haiti, Turkey, and Indonesia, I have witnessed both the unique devastation of each quake and the universal human solidarity that follows. Preparedness and caution can save lives
“Aftershocks finished the task that the main earthquake started,” a mother in Haiti told me in 2010. In Nepal after the 2015 earthquake, my colleagues from Plan International reminded me that the mega earthquake was too vast for Nepal to handle alone. In India, following the Gujarat earthquake (2001), children told me they were too scared to sleep. Imagine children cut off in remote villages, children orphaned by earthquakes lost or wandering amidst ruins, girls at risk of trafficking and abuse. Plan International prioritises all children, especially girls in disasters because emergencies amplify their pre-existing vulnerabilities, making them easy targets for exploitation. Paola Belotti, my colleague, based on her expertise on child protection in humanitarian settings and direct experience in other earthquake settings says “earthquakes expose children to immense risks—separation from family, homelessness, and vulnerability to violence”. Take the 2014 San Francisco earthquake (6.1 magnitude): roads were damaged, people were injured, but there were no immediate deaths. Compassion and solidarity: the true measure of humanity 
Humanitarian efforts must uphold the dignity of survivors and adhere to good and humane practices such as the Sphere humanitarian minimum standards. Donate to the Myanmar Earthquake Appeal

Speech: A gender-equal world is within our reach if we choose it | UN Women – Headquarters,https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/speech/2024/09/speech-a-gender-equal-world-is-within-our-reach-if-we-choose-it,other,0.5,,"The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains the most visionary roadmap for advancing gender equality, empowerment, and the rights of all women and girls, everywhere. Image










                      UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous delivers opening remarks at the side event, “Beijing+30: Achieving gender equality, the rights and empowerment of all women and girls”, Summit of the Future, Action Day 2, 21 September 2024, UN headquarters. Our latest SDG Snapshot Report tells us that, without acceleration, a girl born today will be 39 years old before women hold as many seats in parliament as men, she will be 68 before child marriage ends, and she will be 137 before extreme poverty for women and girls is eradicated. We contend that commemoration must be judged by acceleration and by positive change in the lives of women and girls everywhere. So, we propose six priority drivers for gender equality and the SDGs more broadly:
First, national action plans to end violence against women and girls;
Second, securing women’s leadership through temporary special measures;
Third, unlocking finance to support the care economy and to reduce women’s unpaid care work;
Fourth, bridging the gender digital gap;
Fifth, linking economic empowerment to climate action and transitions to green and blue economies; and
Sixth, ensuring accountability to the women, peace, security, and humanitarian action agendas. We will also work with civil society, in particular women’s and youth organizations, to ensure they have the strategic pathways and resources they need, in the broadest sense, to claim rights and influence action. And we will work within the multilateral system to recommit to SDG 5 acceleration through the Beijing+30 review, including through the Secretary-General’s Gender Equality Acceleration Plan, so that it better delivers on gender equality and a unified position on women’s rights, especially needed in the current context of pushback and regression. Excellencies, dear friends, dear feminists, everyone in this room,
We convene today on the eve of the Summit of the Future, where the world is recommitting to reinvigorated multilateralism and recognizing women’s rights’ rightful place at the heart of it. We owe it to women and girls and to everyone, to our children and theirs, to delay no further and to build a future where women and girls everywhere thrive. Topics

Second, securing women’s leadership through temporary special measures;
Third, unlocking finance to support the care economy and to reduce women’s unpaid care work;
Fourth, bridging the gender digital gap;
Fifth, linking economic empowerment to climate action and transitions to green and blue economies; and
Sixth, ensuring accountability to the women, peace, security, and humanitarian action agendas. We will also work with civil society, in particular women’s and youth organizations, to ensure they have the strategic pathways and resources they need, in the broadest sense, to claim rights and influence action. And we will work within the multilateral system to recommit to SDG 5 acceleration through the Beijing+30 review, including through the Secretary-General’s Gender Equality Acceleration Plan, so that it better delivers on gender equality and a unified position on women’s rights, especially needed in the current context of pushback and regression. Excellencies, dear friends, dear feminists, everyone in this room,
We convene today on the eve of the Summit of the Future, where the world is recommitting to reinvigorated multilateralism and recognizing women’s rights’ rightful place at the heart of it. We owe it to women and girls and to everyone, to our children and theirs, to delay no further and to build a future where women and girls everywhere thrive. Topics

Excellencies, colleagues, fellow feminists, friends,
Next year we commemorate thirty years since the world convened to craft a historic agreement that had no less a vision than to build a world where every woman and girl would live free from discrimination, from violence, and from inequality. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains the most visionary roadmap for advancing gender equality, empowerment, and the rights of all women and girls, everywhere.

Our latest SDG Snapshot Report tells us that, without acceleration, a girl born today will be 39 years old before women hold as many seats in parliament as men, she will be 68 before child marriage ends, and she will be 137 before extreme poverty for women and girls is eradicated. So, we propose six priority drivers for gender equality and the SDGs more broadly:
First, national action plans to end violence against women and girls;
Second, securing women’s leadership through temporary special measures;
Third, unlocking finance to support the care economy and to reduce women’s unpaid care work;
