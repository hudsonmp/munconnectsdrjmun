""Before the war, I had a job that supported my family. We lost our home, our livelihood, and most importantly, our sense of security.”

With support from the IRC’s healthcare services, Abdulnasser has been able to access essential treatment for his family amid deteriorating conditions. For the sake of my children, I hope it ends soon.""

""I never imagined that displacement would last so long,” Haifa recalls. But years passed, and not only did we lose our home, but we also lost our means of earning a living.""

In Al-Dhale'e, Haifa joined an IRC cash-for-work program that helps displaced Yemenis earn an income and rebuild their lives. “We need peace so families like mine can live with dignity and start over.”

Amr represents a generation of young Yemenis whose futures were upended by war. After 10 years, we need to move from emergency assistance to sustainable solutions, especially education, to avoid a lost generation.”

“When the war broke out, I sheltered three displaced families in our small house,” says 49-year-old IRC pharmacist and mother, Inas. We must act now to prevent the collapse of Yemen’s health system.”

“Ten years of war have robbed progress from our lives,” explains Abdulmalik. What Yemen needs is infrastructure, education, and peace to heal.”

""The hardest thing I’ve witnessed is families fleeing their homes, terrified by the bombs that explode on their streets,” says Saad, who leads one of the IRC’s mobile health teams. The world must continue these vital programs to prevent further suffering.""

The Department of State terminated over 10,000 foreign aid grants and contracts in a devastating blow to global humanitarian efforts. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has lost dozens of grants from USAID and the State Department as of February 28th, impacting millions of IRC clients who will no longer get the help they urgently need.Vulnerable communities who rely on humanitarian aid to survive are being left with nothing. This impacts places like Sudan, Yemen and Myanmar, where millions of innocent people are already suffering from war and disaster.Below are just three of the many IRC programs at risk:Malnutrition services for childrenThe IRC runs over 40 nutrition stabilization centers in crisis areas to help children get the care they need to stay alive. These centers save the lives of severely malnourished children by providing 24/7 medical support, special foods like peanut paste to help them recover, and malnutrition prevention support for families.Without funding, hundreds of thousands of people will lose support for feeding babies and young children. With US funds cut, we urgently need your support to continue protecting children like Yema from preventable diseases.Photo: Frédéric Schmuziger for the IRCPreventing violence against women and childrenGlobally, violence affects 1 in 2 children and 1 in 3 women, with the risk soaring to 70% in areas facing humanitarian crises. In countries like Burkina Faso and Nigeria, tens of thousands will be left without any support at all.Basic needs and food assistanceThe IRC's Basic Needs and Food Assistance programs are designed to help people in crisis by providing cash assistance.
