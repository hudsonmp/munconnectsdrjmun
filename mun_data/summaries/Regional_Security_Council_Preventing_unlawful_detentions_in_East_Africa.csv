Increased role for the United Nations: Conference Members call on the United Nations Permanent Forum on People of African Descent, to convene, in close coordination with the African Union Commission, an International Conference, involving former colonial powers, on the issue of reparations as well as to extend the Decade for People of African Descent, for acknowledgement and healing with regard to the Trans-Atlantic enslavement, colonialism, and apartheid. Increased and active role for AU organs Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in the reparations campaign: Conference delegates further call on AU organs, the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) of the African Union, to take concrete measures, in close coordination with the African Union Commission, that would promote and sustain linkages between the various AU organs, the RECs and Civil Society, including through the use of information and communication technology as well as the arts and culture industries to advance reparatory justice and healing.

Establishment by the African Union Commission and inauguration of a Committee of Experts on Reparations, in consultation with Member States, ECOSOCC and other AU Organs as well as the RECs, for the purpose of developing a Common African Policy on Reparations and incorporating therein, an African Reparatory Programme of Action, in accordance with due process and taking into consideration the following proposals:


				To serve as a principal point of reference for the African Union on matters relating to reparations and healing;

				To solicit, nurture and promote reparatory justice knowledge at the African Union, by developing and implementing knowledge about reparations between and among different AU organs, Member States and the global African community;

				Liaise with and support the mandate of an AU Special Envoy on Reparations for Africa; and

				Undertake any other tasks which may be assigned and determined by the African Union. Such a Fund will complement the efforts of similar initiatives in and outside the Continent, while operating as an autonomous entity geared towards ensuring the judicious utilization of a pool of resources to advance the campaign for reparations, in close cooperation with the African Union Commission and for consideration by Member States, according to due process;



Establishment of the Office of AU Special Envoy on Reparations for Africans, to be recommended for consideration according to the AUC due process, and with a view to help champion the international advocacy and campaign for reparations at the global level. Recognition of African civil society efforts on reparations: The African Union Commission, through the Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO) and the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC), have made tremendous progress in engaging and collaborating with African peoples through civil society actors, and expanding engagement with the African Diaspora community through State and non-state institutions. Creation of a transcontinental partnership framework between the AU, CARICOM Latin American States, and the African diaspora in Europe and all other regions in the world, including, where appropriate, relevant CSOs: This will seek to enhance Global South cooperation, in close coordination with the African Union Commission, through stronger collaboration between the African Union (AU) and other inter-governmental entities in the Global South with significant African and people of African descent. This effort will require the African Union, including the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights and African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, CARICOM and Latin American states, Europe and all other regions of the world, among others, in collaboration with civil society, to engage the United Nations and other multilateral bodies on the legal merits of the call for reparations, including on the question of whether acts of enslavement, colonialism and apartheid against Africans, constitute grave violations of human rights at the time they were committed. Increased role for the United Nations: Conference Members call on the United Nations Permanent Forum on People of African Descent, to convene, in close coordination with the African Union Commission, an International Conference, involving former colonial powers, on the issue of reparations as well as to extend the Decade for People of African Descent, for acknowledgement and healing with regard to the Trans-Atlantic enslavement, colonialism, and apartheid. Increased and active role for AU organs Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in the reparations campaign: Conference delegates further call on AU organs, the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) of the African Union, to take concrete measures, in close coordination with the African Union Commission, that would promote and sustain linkages between the various AU organs, the RECs and Civil Society, including through the use of information and communication technology as well as the arts and culture industries to advance reparatory justice and healing. INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE

ON BUILDING A UNITED FRONT TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE

AND REPARATIONS TO AFRICANS

14 TO  17 NOVEMBER 2023

ACCRA, GHANA

ACCRA PROCLAMATION ON REPARATIONS

PREAMBLE

We, the delegates participating in the Accra Reparations Conference held in Accra, Ghana from 14 to 17 November 2023, under the theme ""Building a United Front to Advance the Cause of Justice and Reparations to Africans"" (hereafter referred to as ""Accra Reparations Conference"" or ""Conference""), and hailing from all the regions of the Continent of Africa and the African Diaspora, including the Caribbean, Latin America, USA, Europe and the U.K.;

EXPRESSING our profound appreciation to His Excellency, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the Government and People of the Republic of Ghana and the African Union for co-organizing and conducting this Conference, and to His Excellency Azali Assoumani President of the Union of Comoros, and Chairperson of the African Union (AU) for the support and contribution provided by the Union to this Conference;

ACKNOWLEDGING, with appreciation, the invaluable statements and contributions of the Prime Ministers of Burundi and Barbados, Ministers of Member States of the AU, the Secretary General of the CARICOM, Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, and Senior Officials attending this Conference;

ALSO NOTING WITH DEEP APPRECIATION, the work led by the Permanent Representative of the Government of Ghana to the African Union in conceptualizing, formulating and shepherding the conduct of the Conference and other pre-conference activities with the AU Permanent Representatives Committee (PRC) as well as the substantive and invaluable contributions of the African Union Commission (AUC) in the preparation of the Conference;

RECOGNIZING that the Accra Reparations Conference convened with a shared commitment to addressing historical injustices and injurious crimes committed against Africans and people of African descent, through transatlantic enslavement, colonialism and apartheid, and to addressing the inequities present in the international economic and political orders,  is a demonstration of the African Union's commitment to advancing the cause of reparatory justice and healing for Africans and for all people of African descent;

NOTING that the Accra Reparations Conference is in fulfilment of the decision taken in February 2023 at the 36th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union, endorsing the Government of Ghana's proposal to co-organize with relevant stakeholders and host an International Conference towards ""Building a United Front to Advance the Cause of Justice and the Payment of Reparations to Africans"";

COGNIZANT that in July 2023, a High-Level delegation of the African Union conducted a study tour to the Republic of Barbados, with a view to developing  stronger AU-CARICOM cooperation in advancing the agenda on reparations and racial healing;

NOTING FURTHER that the findings and recommendations that emerged from the Study Tour called for the need to implement joint initiatives that ensure civil society perspectives are represented in the mobilization and advocacy for reparations;

RECALLING that in November 2022, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) passed a resolution (ACHPR/Res.543 (LXXIII) 2022) reaffirming that accountability and the provision of remedies for historical mass crimes, including slavery, the trade and trafficking of enslaved Africans, colonialism and racial segregation are integral to combatting ongoing systemic racism and to the advancement of the human rights of Africans and people of African descent;

FURTHER RECALLING that in August 2022, the Government of the Republic of Ghana and the African Union, in collaboration with global civil society, held the Accra Summit on Reparations and Healing to build on ongoing conversations in and outside of the African Continent and explore ways to create a platform for adoption of a single  transcontinental plan for reparations;

REITERATING our respective and collective understanding and abhorrence of the profound and lasting impacts of slavery, colonialism, racial discrimination and neo-colonialism on Africans and people of African descent, and how these continue to cause immense suffering, cultural disruption, economic exploitation, emotional trauma and unending discrimination endured by Africans and people of African descent throughout history;

AFFIRMING that the fulfilment of reparations is a moral as well as a legal imperative rooted in principles of justice, human rights and human dignity, and that the claim for reparations represents a concrete step towards remedying historical wrongs and fostering healing among the people of Africa and people of African descent;

UNDERSCORING the historic importance of this gathering and the impetus to operationalize proposed and/or existing multi-stakeholder mechanisms and processes as recommended by the 36th  Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union, including but not limited to the establishment of an African Committee of Experts on Reparations for the purpose of developing a Common African Position on Reparations and Healing and incorporate therein, an African-Caribbean Programme of Action; and to consider the establishment of an AU – diaspora-wide program of action in pursuit of the objective of realizing a global African community;

FIRMLY CONVINCED of the need to build on these efforts and outcomes as the basis for establishing a solid foundation for the reinforcement of unity and revitalization of the global

African community as a panacea for a much wider and sustained transcontinental campaign for reparations;

RE-EMPHASIZING the essentiality of resourcing and collectively strengthening the relevant civil society-led actions and initiatives in and outside the African Continent, and promoting a global African reparatory justice campaign that is devoid of unnecessary duplication of efforts;

HEREBY COMMIT to undertaking the following social, cultural, political and economic areas of action;

Guided by the rich deliberations of the Conference attended by legal experts, policymakers, academics, and stakeholders from, among others, the African Union, the global African diaspora and peoples of African descent, and the Caribbean Region

Commitments of the Accra Reparations Conference and Recommendations for Member States of the African Union:

Foreword
In this report, we take stock of the past four years of the AU Commission and make recommendations for the Union in charting the future. We revitalised the AU Peace Fund and mobilised hundreds of millions in support of our Member States’ struggles in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, among other regions, in the areas of capacity building, conflict prevention and peace support operations. The continued and emerging threats to peace and security in several of our Member States remind us that silencing the guns will be a long process that should entail the concerted efforts of the AU, Member States, RECs, citizens and all stakeholders to commit to realise sustainable development, deepen democratic governance, and uphold peace and security.

Foreword
In this report, we take stock of the past four years of the AU Commission and make recommendations for the Union in charting the future. We revitalised the AU Peace Fund and mobilised hundreds of millions in support of our Member States’ struggles in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, among other regions, in the areas of capacity building, conflict prevention and peace support operations. The continued and emerging threats to peace and security in several of our Member States remind us that silencing the guns will be a long process that should entail the concerted efforts of the AU, Member States, RECs, citizens and all stakeholders to commit to realise sustainable development, deepen democratic governance, and uphold peace and security.

February 15, 2025 to December 31, 2025 



 



AU THEME OF THE YEAR 2025: Theme: “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations” The African Union (AU) has designated 2025 as the ""Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations."" This initiative underscores the AU's commitment to addressing historical injustices, including the trans-Atlantic slave trade, colonialism, apartheid, and genocide. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

 The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union (AU) have been working towards reparations and justice for historical crimes against Africans and people of African descent since 1963. In November 2022, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) passed a Resolution on Africa's Reparations Agenda and the Human Rights of Africans in the Diaspora and People of African Descent Worldwide. The International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024) acknowledged the significance of the International Decade for Recognition, Justice, and Development of people of African descent worldwide.At the 36th Ordinary Assembly of the Union, the Heads of States and Governments of the Member States endorsed a proposal by the Republic of Ghana to co-organize and host an International Conference in 2023 on the theme ""Building a United Front to Advance the Cause of Justice and the Payment of Reparations to Africans."" The AU Assembly decision requested the establishment of an African Committee of Experts on Reparations for the purpose of developing a Common African Position on Reparations and incorporating therein, an African Reparatory Programme of Action. THEME OF THE YEAR 2025

THEME OF THE YEAR: ‘‘JUSTICE FOR AFRICANS AND PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT THROUGH REPARATIONS’’The Heads of States and Governments of the AU, at the 37th Ordinary Assembly of the Union held on 17th – 18th February 2024 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, decided pursuant to Assembly/AU/Dec.884(XXXVII) that the theme of the Year for 2025 will be ‘‘Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations.’’ The theme of the year for 2025 on Reparations was a proposal from the Accra 2023 Reparations Conference. The complexities of addressing past wrongs, whether they stem from colonialism, trans-Atlantic enslavement, apartheid or systemic discrimination, necessitate a thorough examination and strategic approach.Having Reparations for Africans and the People of African Descent offers the AU the opportunity to take leadership on the Africa Reparations Agenda, as well as bring together the African citizenry and the African diaspora to build a common and united front for the cause of justice and payment of reparations to Africans for historical crimes and mass atrocities committed against Africans and people of African Descent, including colonization, apartheid, and genocide. Additionally, reparations as the theme of the year will further drive momentum generated by the different initiatives and activities over the years, and for the Commission to promote an active AU-wide engagement on the subject of reparations, in close coordination with the AU Member States, RECs, AU Organs including ECOSOCC, the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights, African Court on Human and People’s Rights, and the African Union Commission on International Law, the Pan African Parliament, African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the African Union Advisory Board Against Corruption, as well as the United Nations system and other relevant partners.Finally, the theme of Year for 2025 on Reparations will support the operationalisation of the reparations for transatlantic-enslavement, colonialism and apartheid as a Flagship Programme of the Union. OBJECTIVES

The objectives of the African Union (AU) Theme of the Year for 2025, titled “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations,” are outlined as follows:

Strengthening AU Institutional Frameworks:

Establish and operationalize key mechanisms, including a Committee of Experts on Reparations and an Africa Reparations Fund.

AU THEME OF THE YEAR 2025: Theme: “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations” The African Union (AU) has designated 2025 as the ""Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations."" This initiative underscores the AU's commitment to addressing historical injustices, including the trans-Atlantic slave trade, colonialism, apartheid, and genocide. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

 The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union (AU) have been working towards reparations and justice for historical crimes against Africans and people of African descent since 1963. In November 2022, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) passed a Resolution on Africa's Reparations Agenda and the Human Rights of Africans in the Diaspora and People of African Descent Worldwide. The International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024) acknowledged the significance of the International Decade for Recognition, Justice, and Development of people of African descent worldwide.At the 36th Ordinary Assembly of the Union, the Heads of States and Governments of the Member States endorsed a proposal by the Republic of Ghana to co-organize and host an International Conference in 2023 on the theme ""Building a United Front to Advance the Cause of Justice and the Payment of Reparations to Africans."" The AU Assembly decision requested the establishment of an African Committee of Experts on Reparations for the purpose of developing a Common African Position on Reparations and incorporating therein, an African Reparatory Programme of Action. THEME OF THE YEAR 2025

AU THEME OF THE YEAR 2025: Theme: “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations” The African Union (AU) has designated 2025 as the ""Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations."" This initiative underscores the AU's commitment to addressing historical injustices, including the trans-Atlantic slave trade, colonialism, apartheid, and genocide. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

 The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union (AU) have been working towards reparations and justice for historical crimes against Africans and people of African descent since 1963. In November 2022, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) passed a Resolution on Africa's Reparations Agenda and the Human Rights of Africans in the Diaspora and People of African Descent Worldwide. The International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024) acknowledged the significance of the International Decade for Recognition, Justice, and Development of people of African descent worldwide.At the 36th Ordinary Assembly of the Union, the Heads of States and Governments of the Member States endorsed a proposal by the Republic of Ghana to co-organize and host an International Conference in 2023 on the theme ""Building a United Front to Advance the Cause of Justice and the Payment of Reparations to Africans."" The AU Assembly decision requested the establishment of an African Committee of Experts on Reparations for the purpose of developing a Common African Position on Reparations and incorporating therein, an African Reparatory Programme of Action. THEME OF THE YEAR 2025

THEME OF THE YEAR: ‘‘JUSTICE FOR AFRICANS AND PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT THROUGH REPARATIONS’’The Heads of States and Governments of the AU, at the 37th Ordinary Assembly of the Union held on 17th – 18th February 2024 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, decided pursuant to Assembly/AU/Dec.884(XXXVII) that the theme of the Year for 2025 will be ‘‘Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations.’’ The theme of the year for 2025 on Reparations was a proposal from the Accra 2023 Reparations Conference. The complexities of addressing past wrongs, whether they stem from colonialism, trans-Atlantic enslavement, apartheid or systemic discrimination, necessitate a thorough examination and strategic approach.Having Reparations for Africans and the People of African Descent offers the AU the opportunity to take leadership on the Africa Reparations Agenda, as well as bring together the African citizenry and the African diaspora to build a common and united front for the cause of justice and payment of reparations to Africans for historical crimes and mass atrocities committed against Africans and people of African Descent, including colonization, apartheid, and genocide. Additionally, reparations as the theme of the year will further drive momentum generated by the different initiatives and activities over the years, and for the Commission to promote an active AU-wide engagement on the subject of reparations, in close coordination with the AU Member States, RECs, AU Organs including ECOSOCC, the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights, African Court on Human and People’s Rights, and the African Union Commission on International Law, the Pan African Parliament, African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the African Union Advisory Board Against Corruption, as well as the United Nations system and other relevant partners.Finally, the theme of Year for 2025 on Reparations will support the operationalisation of the reparations for transatlantic-enslavement, colonialism and apartheid as a Flagship Programme of the Union. OBJECTIVES

The objectives of the African Union (AU) Theme of the Year for 2025, titled “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations,” are outlined as follows:

Strengthening AU Institutional Frameworks:

Establish and operationalize key mechanisms, including a Committee of Experts on Reparations and an Africa Reparations Fund.

This initiative underscores the AU's commitment to addressing historical injustices, including the trans-Atlantic slave trade, colonialism, apartheid, and genocide. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

 The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union (AU) have been working towards reparations and justice for historical crimes against Africans and people of African descent since 1963. The International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024) acknowledged the significance of the International Decade for Recognition, Justice, and Development of people of African descent worldwide.At the 36th Ordinary Assembly of the Union, the Heads of States and Governments of the Member States endorsed a proposal by the Republic of Ghana to co-organize and host an International Conference in 2023 on the theme ""Building a United Front to Advance the Cause of Justice and the Payment of Reparations to Africans."" The AU Assembly decision requested the establishment of an African Committee of Experts on Reparations for the purpose of developing a Common African Position on Reparations and incorporating therein, an African Reparatory Programme of Action. THEME OF THE YEAR 2025

THEME OF THE YEAR: ‘‘JUSTICE FOR AFRICANS AND PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT THROUGH REPARATIONS’’The Heads of States and Governments of the AU, at the 37th Ordinary Assembly of the Union held on 17th – 18th February 2024 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, decided pursuant to Assembly/AU/Dec.884(XXXVII) that the theme of the Year for 2025 will be ‘‘Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations.’’ The theme of the year for 2025 on Reparations was a proposal from the Accra 2023 Reparations Conference. The complexities of addressing past wrongs, whether they stem from colonialism, trans-Atlantic enslavement, apartheid or systemic discrimination, necessitate a thorough examination and strategic approach.Having Reparations for Africans and the People of African Descent offers the AU the opportunity to take leadership on the Africa Reparations Agenda, as well as bring together the African citizenry and the African diaspora to build a common and united front for the cause of justice and payment of reparations to Africans for historical crimes and mass atrocities committed against Africans and people of African Descent, including colonization, apartheid, and genocide. Additionally, reparations as the theme of the year will further drive momentum generated by the different initiatives and activities over the years, and for the Commission to promote an active AU-wide engagement on the subject of reparations, in close coordination with the AU Member States, RECs, AU Organs including ECOSOCC, the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights, African Court on Human and People’s Rights, and the African Union Commission on International Law, the Pan African Parliament, African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the African Union Advisory Board Against Corruption, as well as the United Nations system and other relevant partners.Finally, the theme of Year for 2025 on Reparations will support the operationalisation of the reparations for transatlantic-enslavement, colonialism and apartheid as a Flagship Programme of the Union. OBJECTIVES

The objectives of the African Union (AU) Theme of the Year for 2025, titled “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations,” are outlined as follows:

Strengthening AU Institutional Frameworks:

Establish and operationalize key mechanisms, including a Committee of Experts on Reparations and an Africa Reparations Fund.

Additionally, reparations as the theme of the year will further drive momentum generated by the different initiatives and activities over the years, and for the Commission to promote an active AU-wide engagement on the subject of reparations, in close coordination with the AU Member States, RECs, AU Organs including ECOSOCC, the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights, African Court on Human and People’s Rights, and the African Union Commission on International Law, the Pan African Parliament, African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the African Union Advisory Board Against Corruption, as well as the United Nations system and other relevant partners.Finally, the theme of Year for 2025 on Reparations will support the operationalisation of the reparations for transatlantic-enslavement, colonialism and apartheid as a Flagship Programme of the Union. OBJECTIVES

The objectives of the African Union (AU) Theme of the Year for 2025, titled “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations,” are outlined as follows:

Strengthening AU Institutional Frameworks:

Establish and operationalize key mechanisms, including a Committee of Experts on Reparations and an Africa Reparations Fund.

AU THEME OF THE YEAR 2025: Theme: “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations” The African Union (AU) has designated 2025 as the ""Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations."" This initiative underscores the AU's commitment to addressing historical injustices, including the trans-Atlantic slave trade, colonialism, apartheid, and genocide. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union (AU) have been working towards reparations and justice for historical crimes against Africans and people of African descent since 1963. The International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024) acknowledged the significance of the International Decade for Recognition, Justice, and Development of people of African descent worldwide.At the 36th Ordinary Assembly of the Union, the Heads of States and Governments of the Member States endorsed a proposal by the Republic of Ghana to co-organize and host an International Conference in 2023 on the theme ""Building a United Front to Advance the Cause of Justice and the Payment of Reparations to Africans."" The AU Assembly decision requested the establishment of an African Committee of Experts on Reparations for the purpose of developing a Common African Position on Reparations and incorporating therein, an African Reparatory Programme of Action.

December 02, 2021 



 



In line with the implementation of the roadmap of the AU Theme of the Year for 2021: ""Arts, Culture and Heritage: Levers for Building the Africa We Want"", the African Union Commission -Department of Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social (HHS) in collaboration with the Government of Senegal and the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) organized the Continental Experts’ Workshop on the Restitution of Cultural Property and Heritage at the Museum of Black Civilization in Dakar, Senegal from 30 November to 2nd December 2021. The key objectives of the workshop were to develop a strong Common African Position Paper on the Restitution of Cultural Property and Heritage and to produce a Framework for Action on the Negotiations for the Return/Restitution of Illicitly Trafficked Cultural Property from the Continent. The workshop also afforded an opportunity to reflect on restitution policies for cultural property in Africa and establish networks of African cultural experts, policy makers, dealers, auctioneers, museum curators among others, working in the area of combating illicit trafficking in cultural property and heritage. “The African Union has rightly addressed the pertinent issue of restitution of cultural property and heritage by organizing the Continental Experts’ Workshop on the Restitution of Cultural Property and Heritage which will draft a strong African Position on Restitution of Heritage. Cisse Mariama Mohamed, Director for Social Development, Culture and Sport welcomed participants of the Continental Experts’ Workshop on the Restitution of Cultural Property and Heritage, and expressed the AU Commission gratitude to the Ministry of Culture and Communication of Senegal, the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) and the Museum of Black Civilization for their tireless efforts to make the workshop a reality. This is enshrined in the African Union Constructive Act, the African Union Agenda 2063, the Charter of the African Cultural Renaissance and the Revised AU Plan of Action on Cultural and Creative Industries.” said Ms. The Continental Experts’ Workshop was attended by representatives from AU Member States, OSIWA representatives, Museum of Black Civilizations staff, UNESCO representatives, independent cultural and heritage experts, legal experts, AUCIL representatives, ICRC representatives, ICCROM representatives and staff members from the AU Commission.
